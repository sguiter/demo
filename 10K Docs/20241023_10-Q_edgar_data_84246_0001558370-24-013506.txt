As of September 30, 2024, in addition to the securities included in the allowance for credit losses, the fixed income portfolio contained securities with an unrealized loss position for which an allowance for credit losses had not been recorded. The million in associated unrealized losses represents percent of the fixed income portfolio s cost basis and percent of total invested assets. Isolated to these securities, unrealized losses decreased through the first nine months of 2024, as interest rates fell after the Federal Reserve cut rates in September. Of the total securities, have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 consecutive months or longer. The following table illustrates the total value of fixed income securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 after factoring in the allowance for credit losses. All fixed income securities continue to pay the expected coupon payments and we believe we will recover the amortized cost basis of available-for-sale securities that remain in an unrealized loss position.

Effective rates are dependent upon components of pretax earnings and the related tax effects. The effective tax rate was higher for the three and nine-month periods in 2024 due to higher levels of pretax income, which decreased the percentage impact of tax-favored adjustments. Income tax expense attributable to income from operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal tax rate of percent to pretax income by the items detailed in the table below.

We believe it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be recovered, given the carry back availability as well as the result of future operations, which we believe will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset. shares of common stock (subject to adjustment for changes in our capitalization and other events). Between 2015 and 2023, we granted awards under the 2015 LTIP. The 2015 LTIP was replaced in 2023. In 2023, our shareholders approved the 2023 RLI Corp. Long-Term Incentive Plan (2023, LTIP), which provides for equity-based compensation. In conjunction with the adoption of the 2023 LTIP, effective May 4, 2023, awards are no longer granted under the 2015 LTIP. Awards under the 2023 LTIP may be in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options (incentive or non-qualified), stock appreciation rights, performance units as well as other stock-based awards. Eligibility under the 2023 LTIP is limited to employees, directors, consultants and independent contractors of the Company or any affiliate. The granting of awards under the 2023 LTIP is solely at the discretion of the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the board of directors or its delegate. The maximum number of shares of common stock available for distribution under the 2023 LTIP is shares (subject to adjustment for changes in our capitalization and other events). Since the plan s approval in 2023, we have granted awards under the 2023 LTIP, including thus far in 2024. Compensation expense is based on the probable number of awards expected to vest. The total compensation expense related to equity awards was million and million in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to million and million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The total income tax benefit was less than million and million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Total unrecognized compensation expense relating to outstanding and unvested awards was million, which will be recognized over the weighted average vesting period of years. Stock Options Under the 2023 LTIP, as under the 2015 LTIP, we grant stock options for shares with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant (subject to adjustments for changes in our capitalization, special dividends and other events as set forth in such plans). Options generally vest and become exercisable over a period and expire after grant. For most participants, the requisite service period and vesting period will be the same. For participants who are retirement eligible, defined by the plan as those individuals whose age and years of service equals or greater, the requisite service period is deemed to be met and options are immediately expensed on the date of grant. For participants who will become retirement eligible during the vesting period, the requisite service period over which expense is recognized is the period between the grant date and the attainment of retirement eligibility. Shares issued upon option exercise are newly issued shares.

 Options granted Options exercised ) Options canceled/forfeited ) Outstanding options at September 30, 2024 Exercisable options at September 30, 2024 The intrinsic value of options exercised, which is the difference between the fair value and the exercise price, was million and million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair value of options was estimated using a Black-Scholes based option pricing model with the following weighted average grant-date assumptions and weighted average fair values as of September 30: Risk-free interest rates Dividend yield Expected volatility Expected option life years years The risk-free rate was determined based on U.S. treasury yields that most closely approximated the options expected life. The dividend yield was determined based on the average annualized quarterly dividends paid during the most recent five-year period and incorporated a consideration for special dividends paid in recent history. The expected volatility was calculated based on the median of the rolling volatilities for the expected life of the options. The expected option life was determined based on historical exercise behavior and the assumption that all outstanding options will be exercised at the midpoint of the current date and remaining contractual term, adjusted for the demographics of the current year s grant. Restricted Stock Units In addition to stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) are granted with a value equal to the closing stock price of the Company s stock on the dates the units are granted. For employees, these units generally have a cliff vesting, but have an accelerated vesting feature for participants who are retirement eligible, defined by the plan as those individuals whose age and years of service equals or greater. For directors, these units vest on the earlier of from the date of grant or the next annual shareholders meeting. In addition, the RSUs have dividend participation, which accrue as additional units and are settled with granted stock units at the end of the vesting period. The total fair value of restricted stock units that vested was million and million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 appear throughout this report. These forward looking statements generally include words such as expect, predict, estimate, will, should, anticipate, believe and similar expressions. Such assumptions are, in turn, based on information available and internal estimates and analyses of general economic conditions, competitive factors, conditions specific to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries, claims development and the impact thereof on our loss reserves, the adequacy and financial security of our reinsurance programs, developments in the securities market and the impact on our investment portfolio, regulatory changes and conditions and other factors. These assumptions are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, without limitation those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors within the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Part II within this report. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. Forward looking statements reflect the Company s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this report. While the Company may elect to update these forward looking statements at some point in the future, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. You should review the various risks, uncertainties and other factors listed from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings. OVERVIEW RLI Corp. is a U.S.-based, specialty insurance company that underwrites select casualty, property and surety products through three major subsidiaries. Our focus is on niche markets and developing unique products that are tailored to customers needs. We hire underwriters and claim examiners with deep expertise and provide exceptional customer service and support. We maintain a highly diverse product portfolio and underwrite for profit in all market conditions. In 2023, we achieved our 28th consecutive year of underwriting profitability. Over the 28-year period, we averaged an 88.2 combined ratio. This drives our ability to provide shareholder returns in three different ways: the underwriting income itself, net investment income from our investment portfolio and long-term appreciation in our equity portfolio. We measure the results of our insurance operations by monitoring growth and profitability across three distinct business segments: casualty, property and surety. Growth is measured in terms of gross premiums written, and profitability is analyzed through combined ratios, which are further subdivided into their respective loss and expense components. The property and casualty insurance business is cyclical and influenced by many factors, including price competition, economic conditions, natural or man-made disasters (for example, earthquakes, hurricanes, pandemics and terrorism), interest rates, state regulations, court decisions and changes in the law. One of the unique and challenging features of the property and casualty insurance business is that coverages must be priced before costs have fully developed, because premiums are charged before claims are incurred. This requires that liabilities be estimated and recorded in recognition of future loss and settlement obligations. Due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating these liabilities, there can be no assurance that actual liabilities will equal recorded amounts. If actual liabilities differ from recorded amounts, there will either be an adverse or favorable effect on net earnings. The casualty portion of our business consists largely of commercial excess, personal umbrella, general liability, transportation and management liability coverages, as well as package business and other specialty coverages, such as professional liability and workers compensation for office-based professionals. We also assume a limited amount of risks through quota share and excess of loss reinsurance agreements. The casualty business is subject to the risk of estimating losses and related loss reserves because the ultimate settlement of a casualty claim may take several years to fully develop. The casualty segment is also subject to inflation risk and may be affected by evolving legislation and court decisions that define the extent of coverage and the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses. Our property segment is comprised primarily of commercial fire, hurricane, earthquake, difference in conditions and marine coverages. We also offer homeowners coverages in Hawaii. Property insurance results are subject to the variability introduced by perils such as earthquakes, fires, hurricanes and other storms. Our major catastrophe exposure is to losses caused by earthquakes, primarily on the West Coast, and windstorms affecting commercial properties in coastal regions of the United

Table of Contents 
 States. We limit our net aggregate exposure to a catastrophic event by managing the total policy limits written in a particular region, purchasing reinsurance and maintaining policy terms and conditions throughout all insurance cycles. We also use computer-assisted modeling techniques to provide estimates that help the Company carefully manage the concentration of risks exposed to catastrophic events. The surety segment specializes in writing small to medium-sized contract surety coverages, including payment and performance bonds. We offer a variety of commercial surety bonds for medium to large-sized businesses across a broad spectrum of industries, including the financial, healthcare, energy and renewable energy industries. We also offer a variety of transactional bonds including, but not limited to license and permit, notary and court bonds. Often, our surety coverages involve a statutory requirement for bonds. While these bonds typically maintain a relatively low loss ratio, losses may fluctuate due to adverse economic conditions affecting the financial viability of our insureds. The contract surety product guarantees commercial contractors contractual obligations for a specific construction project. Generally, losses occur due to the deterioration of a contractor s financial condition. The insurance marketplace is competitive across all of our segments. However, we believe that our business model is built to create underwriting income by focusing on sound risk selection and discipline. Our primary focus will continue to be on underwriting profitability, with a secondary focus on premium growth where we believe underwriting profit exists, as opposed to general premium growth or market share measurements. Key Performance Measures The following is a list of key performance measures found throughout this report with their definitions, relationships to GAAP measures and explanations of their importance to our operations. Underwriting Income Underwriting income or profit represents one measure of the pretax profitability of our insurance operations, and is derived by subtracting losses and settlement expenses, policy acquisition costs and insurance operating expenses from net premiums earned, which are all GAAP financial measures. Each of these components are presented in the statements of earnings but are not subtotaled. However, this information is available in total and by segment in note 6 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, regarding operating segment information. The nearest comparable GAAP measure is earnings before income taxes which, in addition to underwriting income, includes net investment income, net realized gains or losses, net unrealized gains or losses on equity securities, general corporate expenses, debt costs and our portion of earnings from unconsolidated investees. A reconciliation of net earnings to underwriting income follows: 

For the Three Months For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net earnings 95,027 13,536 304,919 189,999 Income tax expense 21,798 1,483 75,200 43,842 Earnings before income taxes 116,825 15,019 380,119 233,841 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees (1,238) (1,732) (7,653) (7,169) General corporate expenses 3,994 2,372 13,144 10,805 Interest expense on debt 1,617 1,873 4,839 5,928 Net unrealized (gains) losses on equity securities (38,392) 25,236 (87,314) (15,474) Net realized gains (5,420) (6,558) (11,222) (26,758) Net investment income (36,694) (31,963) (103,502) (87,835) Net underwriting income 40,692 4,247 188,411 113,338 Combined Ratio The combined ratio, which is derived from components of underwriting income, is a common industry performance measure of profitability for underwriting operations and is calculated in two components. First, the loss ratio is losses and settlement expenses divided by net premiums earned. The second component, the expense ratio, reflects the sum of policy acquisition costs and insurance operating expenses divided by net premiums earned. All items included in these components of the combined ratio are presented in our GAAP consolidated financial statements. The sum of the loss and expense ratios is the combined ratio. The difference between the combined ratio and 100 reflects the per-dollar rate of underwriting income or loss.

 Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The most critical accounting policies involve significant estimates and include those used in determining the liability for unpaid losses and settlement expenses, investment valuation, recoverability of reinsurance balances, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred taxes. For a detailed discussion of each of these policies, refer to our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes to critical accounting policies during the year. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net premiums earned increased 19 percent, driven primarily by products in our property and casualty segments. Positive market performance resulted in 87 million of unrealized gains on equity securities in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 15 million in 2023. Investment income was up 18 percent, due to an increased average asset base and higher reinvestment rates. Realized gains during the first nine months of 2024 were comprised of 20 million of realized gains on equity securities, primarily due to rebalancing within our equity strategies, 3 million of realized losses on the fixed income portfolio and 6 million of other realized losses. This compares to 16 million of realized gains on the equity portfolio, 3 million of realized losses on the fixed income portfolio and 14 million of other realized gains from the payout of the working capital escrow from our sale of Maui Jim, Inc. (Maui Jim) in the previous year. 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Consolidated Revenues (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net premiums earned 1,129,230 948,412 Net investment income 103,502 87,835 Net realized gains 11,222 26,758 Net unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities 87,314 15,474 Total consolidated revenue 1,331,268 1,078,479 Underwriting income was 188 million on an 83.3 combined ratio for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 113 million on an 88.0 combined ratio in the same period of 2023. A larger earned premium base resulted in higher levels of underwriting income. Underwriting results for 2024 were impacted by 37 million of pretax losses from Hurricanes Beryl and Helene, as well as 30 million of pretax storm losses. Comparatively, 2023 included 52 million of pretax losses and 14 million of reinsurance reinstatement premium from the Hawaiian wildfires, as well as 27 million of pretax storm losses. Results for each period benefited from favorable development on prior years loss reserves, which provided additional pretax earnings of 85 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 94 million in 2023. The loss ratio decreased to 45.5 from 48.3, due to lower levels of catastrophe losses and low levels of attritional, non-catastrophe property losses on a higher earned premium base in 2024. The expense ratio decreased to 37.8 from 39.7. Despite continued investments in our people and technology, as well as higher levels of bonus and profit-sharing expenses that resulted from improved operating performance, growth of net premiums earned allowed for improved leveraging of our expense base. Bonus and profit-sharing amounts earned by executives, managers and associates are predominantly influenced by corporate performance, including operating earnings, combined ratio and return on capital. Favorable development and other drivers of growth in book value will increase bonus and profit-sharing expenses, while catastrophe losses, adverse development and decreased investment portfolio returns would lead to expense reductions. These performance-related expenses affect policy acquisition, insurance operating and general corporate expenses. Our equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees primarily relates to our investment in Prime Holdings Insurance Services, Inc. (Prime), a specialty insurance company. We recognized 8 million of investee earnings from Prime in the first nine months of 2024 and 7 million in 2023.

 Net earnings for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 305 million, compared to 190 million for the same period in 2023. Higher levels of underwriting income, investment income and unrealized gains on equity securities all contributed to the improved results. Comprehensive earnings totaled 365 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 151 million for the first nine months of 2023. Other comprehensive earnings (loss) primarily included net after-tax unrealized gains (losses) from the fixed income portfolio. Other comprehensive earnings of 60 million in the first nine months of 2024 was attributable to lower interest rates, which increased the fair value of securities held in the fixed income portfolio. Comparatively, 39 million of other comprehensive loss was recognized in 2023, as higher interest rates decreased the fair value of securities held in the fixed income portfolio. Premiums Gross premiums written increased 168 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. Growth was achieved in all three segments. Net premiums earned increased 181 million, driven primarily by products in our property and casualty segments.

We continued to benefit from positive rate movement across a large portion of our casualty segment, as well as from new business growth within our personal umbrella and small commercial distribution channels. Commercial transportation benefited from an increase in new business submissions. Our executive products premium decreased, largely due to the continued soft management liability marketplace. Property Gross premiums written for the property segment increased 51 million in the first nine months of 2024. Our commercial property business was up 26 million in premium, benefiting from rate increases, particularly in the first half of the year. New opportunities led to 19 million of premium growth for our marine product. Additionally, some competitors have reduced their appetite for select Hawaii homeowner coverages, which has allowed our other property premium to grow.

 Surety Gross premiums written for the surety segment increased 14 million for the first nine months of 2024. Contract surety benefited from new agency relationships, new construction projects and elevated material costs. The expansion of existing accounts and new business resulted in increased premium for commercial surety. Underwriting Income 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Underwriting Income (in thousands) Casualty 26,538 57,478 Property 141,298 33,589 Surety 20,575 22,271 Total 188,411 113,338 Combined Ratio Casualty 95.8 89.8 Property 64.4 88.2 Surety 80.5 77.8 Total 83.3 88.0 Casualty The casualty segment recorded underwriting income of 27 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 57 million for the same period last year. Prior accident years reserve releases reduced loss and settlement expenses for the casualty segment by 42 million, primarily on accident years 2019, 2020, 2022 and 2023. Favorable development was widespread, with notable amounts from commercial excess, general liability, professional services, executive products and personal umbrella. In comparison, 69 million of prior accident years reserves were released in the first nine months of 2023. Commercial excess, executive products, general liability, personal umbrella and professional services were drivers of the favorable development in 2023. Hurricane and storm losses on casualty-oriented package policies that include property coverage resulted in 3 million of losses in 2024, compared to less than 2 million of storm losses in 2023. The combined ratio for the casualty segment was 95.8 in 2024, compared to 89.8 in 2023. The segment s loss ratio was 58.9 in 2024, up from 52.7 in 2023. Lower levels of reserve releases on prior accident years and current accident year reserve strengthening on select products resulted in the higher loss ratio in 2024. The expense ratio for the casualty segment was 36.9, down from 37.1 for the same period last year. Property The property segment recorded underwriting income of 141 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 34 million for the same period last year. Underwriting results for 2024 included 33 million of favorable development on prior years loss and catastrophe reserves, 35 million of losses from Hurricanes Beryl and Helene, as well as 28 million of storm losses. Comparatively, the 2023 underwriting results included 17 million of favorable development on prior years loss and catastrophe reserves, 25 million of storm losses, as well as 52 million of losses and 14 million of reinsurance reinstatement premium from the Hawaiian wildfires. Underwriting results for the first nine months of 2024 translated into a combined ratio of 64.4, compared to 88.2 for the same period last year. The segment s loss ratio was 34.0 in 2024, down from 52.3 in 2023. Larger releases on prior years loss reserves, lower catastrophe losses, and low attritional, non-catastrophe losses on a higher earned premium base resulted in the lower loss ratio. The segment s expense ratio decreased to 30.4 in 2024 from 35.9 in the prior year, as the growth in the earned premium base exceeded the growth in expense. Additionally, the expense ratio benefited from an increase in the expense override we earn for writing business on behalf of other carriers.

 Surety The surety segment recorded underwriting income of 21 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 22 million for the same period last year. Both periods reflected positive current accident year underwriting performance and benefited from favorable development on prior years loss reserves. Results for 2024 included favorable development on prior accident years reserves, which decreased loss and settlement expenses for the segment by 11 million. Results for 2023 included 8 million of favorable development on prior accident years reserves. Additionally, 2 million of reinsurance reinstatement premium was recorded in 2024 on a prior year loss, which reduced net premiums earned and underwriting income. The combined ratio for the surety segment totaled 80.5 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 77.8 for the same period in 2023. The segment s loss ratio was 9.0 in 2024, down from 11.8 in 2023. The expense ratio was 71.5, up from 66.0 in the prior year. The impact of the reinsurance reinstatement premium on the earned premium base increased the loss ratio by 0.1 points and the expense ratio by 1.4 points. In addition, the increase in expense ratio was the result of increases in select policy acquisition costs, as well as continued investments in technology and people to support growth and improve customer experiences. Investment Income Our investment portfolio generated net investment income of 104 million during the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 18 percent from the same period in 2023. The increase in investment income was due to higher reinvestment rates, as well as an increased average asset base relative to the prior year. Yields on our fixed income investments for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 

2024 2023 Pretax Yield Taxable 3.79 3.45 Tax-Exempt 2.88 2.79 After-Tax Yield 

Taxable 2.99 2.73 Tax-Exempt 2.73 2.64 The following table depicts the composition of our investment portfolio at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023: 

(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Fixed income 3,176,073 75.2 2,855,849 77.7 Equity securities 729,738 17.3 590,041 16.0 Short-term investments 203,296 4.8 134,923 3.7 Other invested assets 53,993 1.3 59,081 1.6 Cash 60,634 1.4 36,424 1.0 Total investments and cash 4,223,734 100.0 3,676,318 100.0 We believe our overall asset allocation supports our strategy to preserve capital for policyholders, provide sufficient income to support our insurance operations and effectively grow book value over a long-term investment horizon. The fixed income portfolio increased by 320 million in the first nine months of 2024, as cash flows were largely allocated to the fixed income portfolio. Average fixed income duration was 4.8 years at September 30, 2024, reflecting our liability structure and sound capital position. The equity portfolio increased by 140 million during the first nine months of 2024, due to the positive performance of equity markets. Short-term investments increased by 68 million, as yields on AAA-rated government money market funds remained relatively attractive. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 19.8 percent, compared to 18.7 percent for the same period in 2023. Effective rates are dependent upon components of pretax earnings or losses and the related tax effects. The effective tax 

 27 

Table of Contents 
 rate was higher for the nine-month period in 2024 due to higher levels of pretax income, which decreased the percentage impact of tax-favored adjustments, such as tax credits and excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net premiums earned increased 22 percent, driven primarily by products in our property and casualty segments. Positive market performance resulted in 38 million of unrealized gains on equity securities in the third quarter of 2024, compared to unrealized losses of 25 million for the same period in 2023. Investment income was up 15 percent, due to an increased average asset base and higher reinvestment rates. Realized gains during the third quarter of 2024 were comprised of 7 million of realized gains on equity securities, primarily due to rebalancing within our equity strategies, 1 million of realized losses on the fixed income portfolio and less than 1 million of other realized gains. This compares to 7 million of realized gains on the equity portfolio and less than 1 million of realized losses on the fixed income portfolio in the third quarter of 2023. 

For the Three Months Ended September 30, Consolidated Revenues (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net premiums earned 389,489 318,409 Net investment income 36,694 31,963 Net realized gains 5,420 6,558 Net unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities 38,392 (25,236) Total consolidated revenue 469,995 331,694 Underwriting income was 41 million on an 89.6 combined ratio for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4 million on a 98.7 combined ratio in the same period of 2023. Underwriting results for 2024 were impacted by 37 million of pretax losses from Hurricanes Beryl and Helene, as well as 2 million of pretax storm losses. Comparatively, 2023 included 52 million of pretax losses and 14 million of reinsurance reinstatement premium from the Hawaiian wildfires, as well as 5 million of pretax storm losses. Results for each period benefited from favorable development on prior years loss reserves, which provided additional pretax earnings of 21 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 22 million in 2023. The loss ratio decreased to 51.9 from 59.5, due to lower levels of catastrophe losses on a higher earned premium base in 2024. The expense ratio decreased to 37.7 from 39.2. Despite continued investments in our people and technology, as well as higher levels of bonus and profit-sharing expenses that resulted from improved operating performance, growth of net premiums earned allowed for improved leveraging of our expense base. Bonus and profit-sharing amounts earned by executives, managers and associates are predominantly influenced by corporate performance, including operating earnings, combined ratio and return on capital. Favorable development and other drivers of growth in book value will increase bonus and profit-sharing expenses, while catastrophe losses, adverse development and decreased investment portfolio returns would lead to expense reductions. These performance-related expenses affect policy acquisition, insurance operating and general corporate expenses. Our equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees primarily relates to our investment in Prime Holdings Insurance Services, Inc. (Prime), a specialty insurance company. We recognized 1 million of investee earnings from Prime in the third quarter of 2024 and 2 million in 2023. Net earnings for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 95 million, compared to 14 million for the same period in 2023. Higher levels of underwriting income, investment income and unrealized gains on equity securities all contributed to the improved results. Comprehensive earnings totaled 175 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 43 million of comprehensive loss for the same period of 2023. Other comprehensive earnings (loss) primarily included net after-tax unrealized gains (losses) from the fixed income portfolio. Other comprehensive earnings of 80 million in the third quarter of 2024 was attributable to lower interest rates, which increased the fair value of securities held in the fixed income portfolio. Comparatively, 57 million of other comprehensive loss was recognized in 2023, as higher interest rates decreased the fair value of securities held in the fixed income portfolio.

We continued to benefit from positive rate movement across a large portion of our casualty segment, as well as from new business growth across our personal umbrella and small commercial distribution channels. New project work resulted in growth for general liability. Taking advantage of market disruption, rate increases and expanding distribution led to growth in commercial transportation. Competitive market conditions continued to negatively impact executive products. Property Gross premiums written for the property segment increased 15 million in the third quarter of 2024. New opportunities and improved retention led to 8 million of premium growth for our marine product. Rate increases, as well as new opportunities on fire and other peril lines, resulted in a 6 million increase in our commercial property business. Wind rates declined in the third quarter, after four consecutive years of double-digit increases. Additionally, some competitors have reduced their appetite for select Hawaii homeowner coverages, which has allowed our other property premium to grow. Surety Gross premiums written for the surety segment increased 3 million for the third quarter of 2024. Contract surety benefited from new agency relationships, new construction projects and continued increases in material costs.

 Underwriting Income 

For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Underwriting Income (Loss) (in thousands) Casualty 2,549 18,670 Property 30,402 (20,671) Surety 7,741 6,248 Total 40,692 4,247 Combined Ratio Casualty 98.8 90.1 Property 77.2 121.8 Surety 78.8 81.7 Total 89.6 98.7 Casualty The casualty segment recorded underwriting income of 3 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 19 million for the same period last year. Prior accident years reserve releases reduced loss and settlement expenses for the casualty segment by 10 million, primarily on accident years 2017 through 2020, 2022 and 2023. Favorable development was widespread, with notable amounts from commercial excess, professional services, general liability, personal umbrella and executive products. In comparison, 22 million of prior accident years reserves were released in the third quarter of 2023. Executive products, commercial excess, general liability and personal umbrella were drivers of the favorable development in 2023. Hurricane and storm losses on casualty-oriented package policies that include property coverage resulted in 2 million of losses in 2024, compared to less than 1 million of storm losses in 2023. The combined ratio for the casualty segment was 98.8 in 2024, compared to 90.1 in 2023. The segment s loss ratio was 62.8 in 2024, up from 53.7 in 2023. Lower levels of reserve releases on prior accident years and current accident year reserve strengthening on select products resulted in the higher loss ratio in 2024. The expense ratio for the casualty segment was 36.0, down from 36.4 for the same period last year. Property The property segment recorded underwriting income of 30 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 21 million of underwriting loss for the same period last year. Underwriting results for 2024 included 8 million of favorable development on prior years loss and catastrophe reserves, 35 million of losses from Hurricanes Beryl and Helene, as well as 2 million of storm losses. Comparatively, the 2023 underwriting results included less than 1 million of unfavorable development on prior years loss and catastrophe reserves, 5 million of storm losses, as well as 52 million of losses and 14 million of reinsurance reinstatement premium from the Hawaiian wildfires. Underwriting results for the third quarter of 2024 translated into a combined ratio of 77.2, compared to 121.8 for the same period last year. The segment s loss ratio was 45.8 in 2024, down from 86.3 in 2023. Larger releases on prior years loss reserves and lower levels of catastrophe losses contributed to the decline in loss ratio. The segment s expense ratio decreased to 31.4 in 2024 from 35.5 in the prior year, as the growth in the earned premium base exceeded the growth in expense. Additionally, the expense ratio benefited from an increase in the expense override we earn for writing business on behalf of other carriers. Surety The surety segment recorded underwriting income of 8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 6 million for the same period last year. Both periods reflected positive current accident year underwriting performance and benefited from favorable development on prior years loss reserves. Results for 2024 included favorable development on prior accident years reserves, which decreased loss and settlement expenses for the segment by 3 million. Results for 2023 included 1 million of favorable development on prior accident years reserves.

 The combined ratio for the surety segment totaled 78.8 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 81.7 for the same period in 2023. The segment s loss ratio was 8.7 in 2024, down from 17.2 in 2023, due to increased levels of favorable prior accident years reserve development. The expense ratio was 70.1, up from 64.5 in the prior year, due to increases in select policy acquisition costs, as well as continued investments in technology and people to support growth and improve customer experiences. Investment Income Our investment portfolio generated net investment income of 37 million during the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 15 percent from the same period in 2023. The increase in investment income was due to higher interest rates, as well as an increased average asset base relative to the prior year. Yields on our fixed income investments for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 

2024 2023 Pretax Yield Taxable 3.86 3.54 Tax-Exempt 2.98 2.81 After-Tax Yield Taxable 3.05 2.80 Tax-Exempt 2.82 2.66 Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 18.7 percent, compared to 9.9 percent for the same period in 2023. Effective rates are dependent upon components of pretax earnings or losses and the related tax effects. The effective tax rate was higher for the third quarter of 2024 due to higher levels of pretax income, which decreased the percentage impact of tax-favored adjustments, such as tax credits and excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have three primary types of cash flows: (1) cash flows from operating activities, which consist mainly of cash generated by our underwriting operations and income earned on our investment portfolio, (2) cash flows from investing activities related to the purchase, sale and maturity of investments and (3) cash flows from financing activities that impact our capital structure, such as shareholder dividend payments and changes in debt and shares outstanding. The following table summarizes cash flows provided by (used in) our activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

(in thousands) 2024 2023 Operating cash flows 432,139 342,192 Investing cash flows (372,088) (211,473) Financing cash flows (35,841) (135,092) Total 24,210 (4,373) Our largest source of cash is premiums received from customers and our largest cash outflow is claim payments on insured losses. Cash flows from operating activities can vary among periods due to the timing in which these payments are made or received. Operating cash flows in the first nine months of 2024 benefited from increased premium receipts relative to the first nine months of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had 100 million in debt outstanding. On September 15, 2023, we accessed 50 million from our revolving line of credit with PNC Bank, N.A. (PNC). The borrowing may be repaid at any time and carries an adjustable interest rate of 6.68 percent, which will reset during the fourth quarter of 2024. The credit facility with PNC was entered into during the first quarter of 2023 and replaced the previous 60 million facility with Bank of Montreal, Chicago Branch, which expired on March 27, 2023. The line of credit permits us to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 100 million, but may be increased up to an aggregate principal amount of 130 million under certain conditions. The facility has a three-year term that expires on May 29, 2026. Further, RLI Insurance Company borrowed 50 million from the Federal Home

 Loan Bank of Chicago (FHLBC) on November 10, 2023. The borrowing matures on November 12, 2024. Interest is paid monthly at an annualized rate of 5.44 percent. Two of our insurance companies, RLI Insurance Company (RLI Ins.) and Mt. Hawley Insurance Company, are members of the FHLBC. Membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system provides both companies access to an additional source of liquidity via a secured lending facility. Our membership allows each insurance subsidiary to determine tenor and structure at the time of borrowing. As of September 30, 2024, 57 million of investments were pledged as collateral with the FHLBC to ensure timely access to the secured lending facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and other investments maturing within one year of approximately 513 million and an additional 801 million maturing between one to five years. Whereas our strategy is to be fully invested at all times, short-term investments in excess of demand deposit balances are considered a component of investment activities, and thus are classified as investments in our consolidated balance sheets. We believe that cash generated by operations and investments will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated needs over the next 12 to 24 months. In the event they are not sufficient, we believe cash available from financing activities and other sources will provide sufficient additional liquidity. We maintain a diversified investment portfolio representing policyholder funds that have not yet been paid out as claims, as well as the capital we hold for our shareholders. Invested assets at September 30, 2024 have increased 547 million from December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio had the following asset allocation breakdown:

Table of Contents 
 As of September 30, 2024, our fixed income portfolio remained well diversified, with 1,844 individual issues. Our investment portfolio has limited exposure to structured asset-backed securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 176 million in ABS, which are pools of assets collateralized by cash flows from several types of loans, including home equity, credit cards, autos and structured bank loans in the form of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). As of September 30, 2024, we had 182 million in commercial and non-agency MBS and 420 million in MBS backed by government sponsored enterprises (GSEs - Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae). Excluding the GSE-backed MBS, our exposure to ABS and CMBS was 8.6 percent of our investment portfolio at quarter end. We had 1,353 million in corporate fixed income securities as of September 30, 2024, which includes 121 million invested in a high-yield credit strategy. This high-yield portfolio consists of floating rate bank loans and bonds that are below investment grade in credit quality and offer incremental yield over our core fixed income portfolio. The municipal portfolio includes approximately 66 percent taxable securities and 34 percent tax-exempt securities. Approximately 93 percent of our municipal bond portfolio maintains an AA or better rating, while 100 percent of the municipal bond portfolio is rated A or better. Securities within the equity portfolio are well diversified and are primarily invested in broad index exchange traded funds (ETFs). Our actively managed equity strategy has a preference for dividend income and value oriented security selection with low turnover, which minimizes transaction costs and taxes throughout our long investment horizon. As of September 30, 2024, our equity portfolio had a dividend yield of 1.9 percent, compared to 1.3 percent for the S P 500 index. Because of the corporate dividend-received-deduction applicable to our dividend income, we pay an effective tax rate of 13.1 percent on dividends, compared to 21.0 percent on taxable interest and 5.3 percent on municipal bond interest income. The equity portfolio is managed in a diversified and granular manner, with 85 individual securities and four ETF positions. No single company exposure in the equity portfolio represents more than 1 percent of invested assets. Other invested assets include investments in low income housing tax credit and historic tax credit partnerships, membership in the FHLBC and investments in private funds. We had 65 million of investments in unconsolidated investees at September 30, 2024, compared to 57 million at December 31, 2023. Our investment portfolio does not have any exposure to derivatives. As of September 30, 2024, our capital structure consisted of 100 million in debt and 1.7 billion of shareholders equity. Debt outstanding comprised 5 percent of total capital as of September 30, 2024. Interest and fees on debt obligations totaled 5 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 6 million for the same period in 2023. We incurred interest expense on debt at an average annual interest rate of 6.20 percent during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 3.90 percent during the same period last year. We paid a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.29 per share on September 20, 2024, the same amount as the prior quarter. We have increased dividends in each of the last 49 years. Our three insurance companies are subsidiaries of RLI Corp, with RLI Ins. as the first-level, or principal, insurance company. At the holding company (RLI Corp.) level, we rely largely on dividends from our insurance subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt, corporate expenses and dividends to RLI Corp. shareholders. As discussed further below, dividend payments to RLI Corp. from our principal insurance subsidiary are restricted by state insurance laws as to the amount that may be paid without prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of Illinois. As a result, we may not be able to receive dividends from such subsidiary at times and in amounts necessary to pay desired dividends to RLI Corp. shareholders. On a GAAP basis, as of September 30, 2024, our holding company had 1.7 billion in equity. This includes amounts related to the equity of our insurance subsidiaries, which is subject to regulatory restrictions under state insurance laws. The unrestricted portion of holding company net assets is comprised primarily of investments and cash, including 160 million in liquid assets. Unrestricted funds at the holding company are available to fund debt interest, general corporate obligations and dividend payments to our shareholders. If necessary, the holding company also has other 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 potential sources of liquidity that could provide for additional funding to meet corporate obligations or pay shareholder dividends, which include a revolving line of credit, as well as access to capital markets. Ordinary dividends, which may be paid by our principal insurance subsidiary without prior regulatory approval, are subject to certain limitations based upon statutory income, surplus and earned surplus. The maximum ordinary dividend distribution from our principal insurance subsidiary in a rolling 12-month period is limited by Illinois law to the greater of 10 percent of RLI Ins. policyholder surplus, as of December 31 of the preceding year, or the net income of RLI Ins. for the 12-month period ending December 31 of the preceding year. Ordinary dividends are further restricted by the requirement that they be paid from earned surplus. Any dividend distribution in excess of the ordinary dividend limits is deemed extraordinary and requires prior approval from the Illinois Department of Insurance (IDOI). In the first nine months of 2024, RLI Ins. paid 51 million in ordinary dividends to RLI Corp. In 2023, RLI Ins. paid ordinary dividends totaling 145 million. As of September 30, 2024, 1 million of the net assets of our principal insurance subsidiary were not restricted and could be distributed to RLI Corp. as ordinary dividends without prior approval from the IDOI. Because the limitations are based upon a rolling 12-month period, the amount and impact of these restrictions vary over time. In addition to restrictions from our principal subsidiary s insurance regulator, we also consider internal models and how capital adequacy is defined by our rating agencies in determining amounts available for distribution. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There have been no material changes to our exposure to market risk from that reported in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Historically, our primary market risks have been equity price risk associated with investments in equity securities and interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed income securities. We have consistently invested in high credit quality, investment grade securities. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the financial statements and other disclosures included in this report, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was performed, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired control objective, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We believe that our disclosure controls and procedures provide such reasonable assurance. No changes were made to our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
