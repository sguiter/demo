 PSG formerly included the divisions of Advanced Power Division and Integrated Circuits, Protection and Signal Division ("IPS"). During the first quarter of 2024, management reorganized them to the divisions of Automotive Power Division, Industrial Power Division and Multi-Market Power Division MPD ). Further, IPS was split, with portions remaining in MPD and portions moving to the new Integrated Circuits Division within AMG. Management performed a goodwill impairment analysis on the divisions (which were the reporting units) prior to and after the reorganization and did not identify an impairment.

 The Company operates in various geographic locations. Sales to external customers have little correlation to where products are manufactured or the location of the end-customers. It is, therefore, not meaningful to present operating profit by geographical location. 
 
 The Company does not discretely allocate assets to its operating segments, nor does management evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. The consolidated assets used in manufacturing are generally shared and are not specifically ascribed to operating and reportable segments. In situations where the carrying amounts assigned to an asset group need to be evaluated for recoverability, judgment is used to determine the carrying amounts of the asset group based on the facts and circumstances.

 Indemnification Contingencies 
 
 The Company is a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business, including acquisition agreements, pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements. Some of the agreements entered into by the Company require it to indemnify the other party against losses due to IP infringement, property damage (including environmental contamination), personal injury, failure to comply with applicable laws, the Company s negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets. In the case of certain acquisition agreements, these agreements may require us to maintain such indemnification provisions for the acquiree s directors, officers and other employees and agents, in certain cases for a number of years following the acquisition. 
 
 While the Company s future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification, other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of the Company s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 During the first quarter of 2024, we renamed our Advanced Solutions Group ("ASG") reportable segment to Analog and Mixed-Signal Group ("AMG") and reorganized the existing divisions within PSG and AMG. See Note 2: ''Segments and Revenue'' in the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the segment reorganization. As of September 27, 2024, we were organized into the three operating and reportable segments of PSG, AMG and ISG. 
 
 Business Strategy Developments 
 
 Our primary focus continues to be on profitable revenue with stable gross margin by capturing high-growth megatrends in our focused end-markets of automotive and industrial infrastructure. We design products in highly-differentiated markets focused on customer needs while optimizing and right-sizing our manufacturing footprint to support growth and maintain gross margins through efficiencies and new product development. We are focused on achieving efficiencies in our operating and capital expenditures, capital allocation on research and development investments and resources to accelerate growth in high-margin products. 
 
 2024 Business Realignment 
 
 In an effort to streamline resources, drive organizational efficiencies, consolidate our global corporate footprint, and align with our "Fab Right" manufacturing strategy, we initiated the 2024 business realignment efforts during the second quarter of 2024. Under this business realignment, approximately 1,100 employees were notified of their employment termination and around 200 additional employees were reassigned or asked to relocate to another site so far. During the nine months ended September 27, 2024, we incurred severance and other related charges of approximately 70.1 million and asset impairments and other charges of approximately 29.5 million. For additional information, see Note 4: ''Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other Charges, Net'' in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 During the quarter ended September 27, 2024, we repurchased approximately 2.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 200.4 million.

 Revenue from ISG decreased by 185.3 million, or approximately 18 , for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 29, 2023, largely driven by a decrease in revenue from our Industrial and Consumer Solutions Division and Automotive Sensing Division of 100.3 million and 85.0 million, respectively, primarily due to the decrease in demand for these products in the automotive and industrial end-markets. 
 
 Revenue by geographic location, i ncluding local sales made by operations within each area, based on sales billed from the respective region, was as follows (dollars in millions):

 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 
 Gross profit was 2,437.0 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 compared to 2,941.6 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, representing a decrease of 504.6 million, or approximately 17 . This was primarily due to the decline in sales volume from existing products and new products which negatively impacted gross profit by approximately 487 million and 79 million, respectively, partially offset by approximately 62 million due to a reduction in the lower-margin manufacturing services revenue at our EFK location. 
 
 Our gross margin decreased by 1.7 percentage points to 45.5 for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 from 47.2 for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, primarily due to changes as explained in the segment gross margin sections below.

 PSG gross profit decreased by 318.8 million, primarily driven by the decline in sales volume from existing products and new products which negatively impacted gross profit by approximately 240 million and 79 million, respectively. PSG gross margin decreased by 5.6 percentage points to 41.7 from 47.3 , primarily as a result of the decline in volume, underutilization and the related impact of unfavorable product mix. 
 
 AMG gross profit decreased by 89.3 million, primarily driven by the decline sales volume from existing products which negatively impacted gross profit by approximately 151 million, partially offset by improved gross profit of approximately 62 million from the lower-margin manufacturing services revenue at our EFK location. AMG gross margin increased by 2.8 percentage points to 49.3 from 46.5 , primarily due to the reduction in the lower-margin manufacturing services revenue at our EFK location. 
 
 ISG gross profit decreased by 96.5 million, primarily driven by the decline in sales volume from existing products. ISG gross margin decreased 0.9 percentage points to 47.6 from 48.5 , primarily driven by unfavorable changes in product mix. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Research and development expenses were 457.5 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 427.1 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, representing an increase of 30.4 million, or approximately 7 . The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll-related expenses and production supplies, partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation. 
 
 Selling and marketing expenses were 203.1 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 211.6 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, representing a decrease of 8.5 million, or approximately 4 . The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales commissions. 
 
 General and administrative expenses were 275.8 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 273.8 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, representing an increase of 2.0 million, or approximately 1 . The increase was primarily attributable to expenses associated with information technology initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in the bad debt provision with a strategic business partner and a decrease in variable compensation. 
 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 
 Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets 
 
 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was 38.5 million and 39.0 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of 0.5 million, or approximately 1 . The decrease was due to a reduction in amortization expense as certain intangible assets became fully amortized. 
 
 Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other, Net 
 
 Restructuring, asset impairments and other, net was 103.0 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 63.5 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, representing an increase of 39.5 million. Amounts incurred for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 related primarily to the business realignment efforts in the first nine months of 2024. See Note 4: ''Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other Charges, Net'' in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information.

Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense decreased by 12.0 million to 47.0 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 59.0 million during the nine months ended September 29, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to higher variable-rate debt that was paid down and replaced by the 0.50 Notes in 2023. Our average gross long-term debt balance for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was 3,379.9 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 1.9 , as compared to 3,363.9 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.3 for the nine months ended September 29, 2023. The calculation of our weighted-average interest rates includes the effect of our interest rate swap agreements. 
 
 Interest Income 
 
 Interest income increased by 16.8 million, or approximately 25 , to 83.6 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 compared to 66.8 million during the nine months ended September 29, 2023, primarily due to higher interest rates and increased balances in interest-bearing accounts. 
 
 Loss on Debt Prepayment 
 
 There was no loss on debt prepayment recognized for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 13.3 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 due to the write-off relating to the partial repayment of the Term Loan "B" Facility in 2023. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 
 Other income (expense) was an income of 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 as compared to 4.5 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023. 
 
 Income Tax Provision 
 
 We recorded an income tax provision of 200.1 million and 302.7 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 14.3 and 15.7 , respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate is mainly due to return-to-provision adjustments reflecting additional tax benefits from Foreign Derived Intangible Income. 
 
 For additional information, see Note 12: ''Income Taxes'' in the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility as well as new debt and/or equity issuances. In the near term, we expect to fund our cash requirements by utilizing any or a combination of these principal sources, including any amounts required to satisfy our current portion of long-term debt. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were approximately 2.8 billion as of September 27, 2024, and the Revolving Credit Facility has approximately 1.1 billion available for future borrowings. 
 
 We require cash to: (i) fund our operating expenses, working capital requirements, outlays for strategic acquisitions and investments; (ii) service our debt, including principal and interest; (iii) incur capital expenditures; and (iv) repurchase our common stock. During the ordinary course of business, we evaluate our cash requirements and, if necessary, adjust our expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand. Our capital expenditures are primarily directed towards manufacturing equipment. Future capital expenditures may be impacted by events and transactions that are not currently forecasted. 
 
 We believe that our cash on hand, cash generated from our operations and the amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility are adequate to meet our working capital requirements and other business needs for at least the next 12 months.

 Operating Activities 
 
 Our cash flows from operating activities were 1,326.7 million and 1,366.3 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The decrease of 39.6 million was primarily due to a reduction in net income driven by lower end-market demand for our products partially offset by the timing of cash receipts and payments related to working capital balances. 
 
 Our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on, among other factors, our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets. Management of our assets and liabilities, including both working capital and long-term assets and liabilities, also influences our operating cash flows. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Our cash flows used in investing activities were 858.1 million and 1,352.7 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The decrease of 494.6 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures and payments for the acquisition of our EFK location during the nine months ended September 29, 2023 partially offset by the purchase of short-term investments. Our capital expenditures as a percent of revenue were approximately 10 , and we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 8 - 10 of revenue for the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Our cash flows used in financing activities were 480.5 million and 254.3 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The increase of 226.2 million was primarily attributable to increased share repurchases during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 29, 2023, we had net cash outflows related to the establishment of our New Credit Agreement. 
 
 We do not have any meaningful debt maturing during the next 12 months. Our 0 Notes are also classified as a current liability based on share price trigger provisions. We expect to continue our Share Repurchase Program subject to market conditions, the price of our shares and other factors (including liquidity needs). However, the Share Repurchase Program may be modified, suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice. 
 
 Key Factors Potentially Affecting Liquidity 
 
 We believe that the key factors that could adversely affect our internal and external sources of cash include, among other considerations: 
 changes in demand for our products, competitive pricing pressures, supply chain constraints, effective management of our manufacturing capacity, our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses, our ability to make progress on the achievement of our business strategy and sustainability goals, the impact of our restructuring programs on our production and cost efficiency, and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business; and 
 the debt and equity capital markets could impact our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise, including interest rate fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, sudden reductions in the general availability of lending from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing and our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements in effect from time to time. 

Debt Guarantees and Related Covenants 
 
 As of September 27, 2024, we were in compliance with the indentures relating to our 0 Notes, 0.50 Notes and 3.875 Notes and with covenants included in the New Credit Agreement. The 0 Notes, 0.50 Notes and 3.875 Notes are senior to the existing and future subordinated indebtedness of onsemi and its guarantor subsidiaries, rank equally in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt and, as unsecured obligations, are subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt.

No person acting in connection with the administration of the Plan will, in that capacity, participate in deciding any matter relating to his or her participation in the Plan. 
 (b) The Custodian . The Custodian will act as custodian under the Plan and will perform duties under the Plan and in any agreement between the Company and the Custodian. The Custodian will establish and maintain Participants Stock Accounts and any subaccounts as may be necessary or desirable to administer the Plan. 
 (c) Waivers . The Board may waive or modify any requirement that a notice or election be made or filed under the Plan a specified period in advance on an individual case or by adopting a rule or regulation under the Plan, without amending the Plan. 
 (d) Other Administrative Provisions . The Company will furnish information from its records as directed by the Board, and such records, including a Participant s Earnings, will be conclusive on all persons unless determined by the Board to be incorrect. Each Participant and other person claiming benefits under the Plan must furnish to the Company in writing an up-to-date mailing address and any other information as the Board or Custodian may reasonably request. Any communication, statement, or notice mailed with postage prepaid to any such Participant or other person at the last mailing address filed with the Company will be deemed sufficiently 
 3 

given when mailed and will be binding upon the named recipient. The Plan will be administered on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis and uniform rules will apply to all persons similarly situated. All Participants will have equal rights and privileges (subject to the terms of the Plan) with respect to Purchase Right outstanding during any given Offering Period in accordance with Code Section 423(b)(5). With respect to an Offering under the 423 Component, the terms of separate Offerings need not be identical, provided that all Participants in a particular Offering will have equal rights and privileges, except as otherwise may be permitted by Section 423 of the Code. An Offering under the Non-423 Component need not satisfy such requirements. 
 (e) Non-423 Component . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Plan, the Board may adopt terms and conditions governing Offerings which shall take precedence over the provisions of this Plan and or adopt rules or procedures relating to the operation and administration of the Plan, in each case, to accommodate the specific requirements of local laws, customs and procedures for or to facilitate favorable tax treatment available in jurisdictions outside of the United States. To the extent inconsistent with the requirements of Section 423, any Offering containing such differing terms and conditions contemplated under the foregoing sentence shall be considered to be made under the Non-423 Component and such Offering shall not be required by the terms of the Plan to comply with Section 423 of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board specifically is authorized to adopt rules, procedures and subplans, which, for purposes of the Non-423 Component, may be outside the scope of Section 423 of the Code, regarding, without limitation, eligibility to participate in the Plan, the definition of Earnings, handling of payroll deductions, making of contributions to the Plan (including, without limitation, in forms other than payroll deductions), establishment of bank or trust accounts to hold payroll deductions or other contributions, payment of interest, conversion of local currency, obligations to pay payroll tax, determination of beneficiary-designation requirements, withholding procedures and handling of Stock issuances, which may vary according to local requirements. 
 4. Stock Subject to Plan . Subject to adjustment as provided below, the total number of shares of Stock reserved and available for issuance or which may be otherwise acquired upon exercise of Purchase Rights under the Plan will be 34,500,000. If, at the end of any Offering Period, the number of shares of Stock with respect to which Purchase Rights are to be exercised exceeds the number of shares of Stock then available under the Plan, the Board shall make a pro rata allocation of the shares of Stock remaining available for purchase in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable. Any shares of Stock delivered by the Company under the Plan may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares or shares of Stock purchased on the open market. The number of such shares of Stock or kind and number of other securities subject to the Plan, the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be purchased during an Offering Period and the Purchase Price will be proportionately adjusted, as determined by the Board, in the event of any extraordinary dividend or other distribution, recapitalization, forward or reverse split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or share exchange, or other similar corporate transaction or event affecting the Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, up to the maximum number of shares of Stock reserved under this Section 4 may be used to satisfy purchases of Stock under the 423 Component and any remaining portion of such 
 4 

maximum number of shares of Stock may be used to satisfy purchases of Stock under the Non-423 Component. 
 5. Enrollment and Contributions . 
 (a) Eligibility . An employee of the Company or any Designated Company may be enrolled in the Plan for any Offering Period if such employee is employed by the Company or a Designated Company on the first day of the Offering Period unless such person would, immediately upon enrollment, be deemed to own, for purposes of Section 423(b)(3) of the Code, an aggregate of five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all outstanding shares of all classes of the Stock of the Company or any Subsidiary. In addition, prior to an Offering Period, the Board may determine, in its discretion (but on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis for Offerings under the 423 Component), to exclude employees from participating in that Offering, if, as of the first day of the Offering Period, the employee 
 i) has not completed a specified minimum period of service (not to exceed two years) or 
 ii) customarily works 20 hours or less per week (or a lesser number of weekly hours as may be specified by the Board) or 
 iii) customarily works five months or less in a calendar year (or a lesser number of months as may be specified by the Board). 
 The Company will notify an employee of the date as of which he or she is eligible to enroll in the Plan and will make available to each eligible employee the necessary enrollment forms. Notwithstanding the above, any individual who is employed by the Company or a Designated Company and who is a citizen or resident of a foreign jurisdiction (without regard to whether they are also citizens of the United States or resident aliens (within the meaning of section 7701(b)(1)(A))) will be ineligible to participate in the Plan if the offering is prohibited under the laws of the jurisdiction or if compliance with the laws of the jurisdiction would cause the offering to violate Section 423 of the Code. Additionally, the offer of the Purchase Right and the delivery of Stock under the Plan shall be effective for any individual who is employed by the Company or Designated Company and who is working outside of the United States only after the Company has complied with the applicable laws of the country in which the employee is working. 
 For purposes of clarity, and unless otherwise required by Section 423 of the Code, the term employee will not include the following, regardless of any subsequent reclassification as an employee by the Company or a Designated Company, any governmental agency, or any court any independent contractor any consultant any individual performing services for the Company or a Designated Company who has entered into an independent contractor or consultant agreement with the Company or a Designated Company any individual performing services for the Company or a Designated Company under a purchase order, a supplier agreement or any other agreement that the Company or a Designated Company enters into for services any individual classified by the 
 5 

Company or a Designated Company as contract labor (such as contractors, contract employees, job shoppers), regardless of length of service any individual whose base wage or salary is not processed for payment by the payroll department(s) or payroll provider(s) of the Company or a Designated Company and any leased employee. The Board has exclusive discretion to determine whether an individual is an employee for purposes of the Plan. 
 (b) Initial Enrollment . An employee who is eligible under Section 5(a) (or who will become eligible on or before a given Offering Period) may, after receiving current information about the Plan, initially enroll in the Plan by executing and filing with the Company a properly completed enrollment form, including the employee s election as to the rate of payroll contributions for the Offering Period. To be effective for any Offering Period, such enrollment form must be filed at least two weeks (or such other period determined by the Board) preceding such Offering Period. 
 (c) Automatic Re-enrollment for Subsequent Offering Periods . A Participant whose enrollment in, and payroll contributions under, the Plan continues throughout an Offering Period will automatically be re-enrolled in the Plan for the next Offering Period unless (i) the Participant terminates enrollment before the next Offering Period in accordance with Section 7(a), or (ii) the Participant is ineligible to participate under Section 5(a). The initial rate of payroll contributions for a Participant who is automatically re-enrolled for an Offering Period will be the same as the rate of payroll contribution in effect at the end of the preceding Offering Period, unless the Participant files a new enrollment form designating a different rate of payroll contributions and such new enrollment form is received no later than two weeks (or such other period determined by the Board) prior to the beginning of the next Offering Period. 
 (d) Payroll Contributions . A Participant will make contributions under the Plan at the rate elected by the Participant in his or her enrollment form in effect for that Offering Period (except that such rate may be changed during the Offering Period to the extent permitted below) by means of payroll deductions from each payroll period which ends during the Offering Period. The rate of payroll contributions elected by a Participant may not be less than one percent (1 nor more than ten percent (10 of the Participant s Earnings for the Offering Period, and only whole percentages may be elected provided, however, that the Board may specify a lower minimum rate and higher maximum rate, subject to Section 8(c). Notwithstanding the above, a Participant s payroll contributions will be adjusted downward by the Company as necessary to ensure that the limit on the amount of Stock purchased for an Offering Period set forth in Section 6(a)(iii) is not exceeded. A Participant may elect to increase, decrease, or discontinue payroll contributions for a future Offering Period by filing a new enrollment form designating a different rate of payroll contributions, which form must be received at least two weeks (or such other period determined by the Board) prior to the beginning of an Offering Period to be effective for that Offering Period. In addition, a Participant may elect to discontinue payroll contributions during an Offering Period by filing a new enrollment form, such change to be effective for the next payroll after the Participant s new enrollment form is received. 
 6 

(e) Crediting Payroll Contributions to Cash Accounts . All payroll contributions by a Participant under the Plan will be credited to a Cash Account maintained by the Company on behalf of the Participant. The Company will credit payroll contributions to each Participant s Cash Account as soon as practicable after the contributions are withheld from the Participant s Earnings. 
 (f) No Interest on Cash Accounts . No interest will be credited or paid on cash balances in any Participant s Cash Account pending investment in Stock. 
 6. Purchases of Stock . 
 (a) Purchase Rights . Enrollment in the Plan for any Offering Period by a Participant will constitute a grant by the Company of a Purchase Right to such Participant for such Offering Period. Each Purchase Right will be subject to the following terms 
 i) The purchase price of each share of Stock purchased for each Offering Period will equal 85 of the lesser of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the first day of an Offering Period, or the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the last day of an Offering Period. 
 ii) Except as limited in (iii) below, the number of shares of Stock that may be purchased upon exercise of the Purchase Right for an Offering Period will equal the number of shares (including fractional shares) that can be purchased at the purchase price specified in Section 6(a)(i) with the aggregate amount credited to the Participant s Cash Account as of the last day of an Offering Period. 
 iii) The number of shares of Stock subject to a Participant s Purchase Right for any Offering Period will not exceed the lesser of (1) 500 shares of Stock, or (2) the number derived by dividing 6,250 by 100 of the Fair Market Value of one share of Stock on the first day of the Offering Period for the Offering Period. 
 iv) The Purchase Right will be automatically exercised on the last day of the Offering Period. 
 v) Payments by a Participant for Stock purchased under a Purchase Right will be made only through payroll deduction in accordance with Section 5(d) and (e). 
 vi) The Purchase Right will expire on the earlier of the last day of the Offering Period or the date on which the Participant s enrollment in the Plan terminates. 
 (b) Purchase of Stock . At or as promptly as practicable after the last day of an Offering Period, amounts credited to each Participant s Cash Account will be applied by the Company to purchase Stock, in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Shares of Stock will be purchased from the Company or in the open market, as the Board 
 7 

determines. The Company will aggregate the amounts in all Cash Accounts when purchasing Stock, and shares purchased will be allocated to each Participant s Stock Account in proportion to the cash amounts withdrawn from such Participant s Cash Account. After completing purchases for each Offering Period (which will be completed in not more than 15 calendar days after the last day of an Offering Period), all shares of Stock so purchased for a Participant will be credited to the Participant s Stock Account. 
 (c) Dividend Reinvestment Other Distributions . Cash dividends on any Stock credited to a Participant s Stock Account will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of Stock such amounts will not be available in the form of cash to Participants. The Company will aggregate all purchases of Stock in connection with dividend reinvestment for a given dividend payment date. Purchases of Stock for purposes of dividend reinvestment will be made as promptly as practicable (but not more than 15 calendar days) after a dividend payment date. The purchases will be made directly from the Company at 100 of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the dividend payment date or on the open market. Any shares of Stock distributed as a dividend or distribution in respect of shares of Stock or in connection with a split of the Stock credited to a Participant s Stock Account will be credited to such Account. 
 (d) Withdrawals and Transfers . Shares of Stock may be withdrawn from a Participant s Stock Account, in which case one or more certificates for whole shares may be issued in the name of, and delivered to, the Participant, with such Participant receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares based on the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the day preceding the date of withdrawal. Alternatively, whole shares of Stock may be withdrawn from a Participant s Stock Account by means of a transfer to a broker-dealer or financial institution that maintains an account for the Participant, together with the transfer of cash in lieu of fractional shares based on the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the day preceding the date of withdrawal. Participants may not designate any other person to receive shares of Stock withdrawn or transferred under the Plan. A Participant seeking to withdraw or transfer shares of Stock must give instructions to the Custodian in such manner and form as may be prescribed by the Custodian, which instructions will be acted upon as promptly as practicable. Withdrawals and transfers will be subject to any fees imposed in accordance with Section 8(a). 
 (e) Excess Account Balances . If any amounts remain in a Cash Account following the date on which the Company purchases Stock for an Offering Period as a result of the limitation set forth in Section 6(a)(iii) or for any other reason, such amounts will be returned to the Participant as promptly as practicable. 
 7. Termination and Distributions . 
 (a) Termination of Enrollment . A Participant s enrollment in the Plan will terminate upon (i) the beginning of any payroll period or Offering Period that begins after he or she files a written notice of termination of enrollment with the Company, provided that such Participant will continue to be deemed to be enrolled with respect to any completed Offering Period for which purchases have not been completed, (ii) such time as the Participant becomes ineligible to participate under Section 5(a) of the 
 8 

Plan, or (iii) the termination of the Participant s employment by the Company and its Subsidiaries. An employee whose enrollment in the Plan terminates may again enroll in the Plan as of any subsequent Offering Period if he or she satisfies the eligibility requirements of Section 5(a) as of such Offering Period. A Participant s election to discontinue payroll contributions will not constitute a termination of enrollment. 
 (b) Distribution . As soon as practicable after a Participant s enrollment in the Plan terminates, amounts in the Participant s Cash Account which resulted from payroll contributions will be repaid to the Participant. The Custodian will continue to maintain the Participant s Stock Account for the Participant until the earlier of such time as the Participant directs the sale of all Stock in the Account, withdraws, or transfers all Stock in the Account, or one year after the Participant ceases to be employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries. If a Participant s termination of enrollment results from his or her death, all amounts payable will be paid to his or her estate. 
 8. General . 
 (a) Costs . Costs and expenses incurred in the administration of the Plan and maintenance of Accounts will be paid by the Company, to the extent provided in this Section 8(a). Any brokerage fees and commissions for the purchase of Stock under the Plan (including Stock purchased upon reinvestment of dividends and distributions) will be paid by the Company, but any brokerage fees and commissions for the sale of Stock under the Plan by a Participant will be borne by such Participant. The rate at which such fees and commissions will be charged to Participants will be determined by the Custodian or any broker-dealer used by the Custodian (including an affiliate of the Custodian) and communicated from time to time to Participants. In addition, the Custodian may impose or pass through a reasonable fee for the withdrawal of Stock in the form of stock certificates (as permitted under Section 6(d)), and reasonable fees for other services unrelated to the purchase of Stock under the Plan, to the extent approved in writing by the Company and communicated to Participants. 
 (b) Statements to Participants . The Participant s statement will reflect payroll contributions, purchases, sales, and withdrawals and transfers of shares of Stock and other Plan transactions by appropriate adjustments to the Participant s Accounts. The Custodian will, not less frequently than quarterly, provide or cause to be provided a written statement to the Participant showing the transactions in his or her Stock Account and the date thereof, the number of shares of Stock credited or sold, the aggregate purchase price paid or sales price received, the purchase or sales price per share, the brokerage fees and commissions paid (if any), the total shares held for the Participant s Stock Account (computed to at least three decimal places), and such other information as agreed to by the Custodian and the Company. 
 (c) Compliance with Section 423 . It is the intent of the Company that the 423 Component of this Plan comply in all respects with applicable requirements of Section 423 of the Code and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, if any provision of this Plan does not comply with such requirements, such provision will be construed or deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements as it pertains to an Offering under the 423 Component. 
 9 

9. General Provisions . 
 (a) Compliance With Legal and Other Requirements . The Plan, the granting and exercising of Purchase Rights hereunder, and the other obligations of the Company and the Custodian under the Plan will be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any regulatory or governmental agency as may be required. The Company may, in its discretion, postpone the issuance or delivery of Stock upon exercise of Purchase Rights until completion of such registration or qualification of such Stock or other required action under any federal or state law, rule, or regulation, or the laws of any country in which employees of the Company and a Subsidiary who are nonresident aliens and who are eligible to participate reside, or other required action with respect to any automated quotation system or stock exchange upon which the Stock or other Company securities are designated or listed, or compliance with any other contractual obligation of the Company, as the Company may consider appropriate. In addition, the Company may require any Participant to make such representations and furnish such information as it may consider appropriate in connection with the issuance or delivery of Stock in compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, designation or listing requirements, or other contractual obligations. 
 (b) Limits on Encumbering Rights . No right or interest of a Participant under the Plan, including any Purchase Right, may be pledged, encumbered, or hypothecated to or in favor of any party, subject to any lien, obligation, or liability of such Participant, or otherwise assigned, transferred, or disposed of except pursuant to the laws of descent or distribution, and any right of a Participant under the Plan will be exercisable during the Participant s lifetime only by the Participant. 
 (c) No Right to Continued Employment . Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder, including the grant of a Purchase Right, will be construed as giving any employee the right to be retained in the employ of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate, nor will it interfere in any way with the right of any of the foregoing to terminate any employee s employment at any time. 
 (d) Taxes . The Company, any Subsidiary or Affiliate is authorized to withhold from any payment to be made to a Participant, including any payroll and other payments not related to the Plan, amounts of withholding and other taxes due in connection with any transaction under the Plan, and a Participant s enrollment in the Plan will be deemed to constitute his or her consent to such withholding. In addition, Participants may be required to advise the Company of sales and other dispositions of Stock acquired under the plan in order to permit the Company to comply with tax laws and to claim any tax deductions to which the Company may be entitled with respect to the Plan. This provision and other Plan provisions do not set forth an explanation of the tax consequences to Participants under the Plan. A brief summary of the tax consequences will be included in disclosure documents to be separately furnished to Participants. 
 (e) Changes to the Plan . The Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Plan without the consent of shareholders or Participants, except that any such action will be subject to the approval of the Company s shareholders within 
 10 

one year after such Board action if such shareholder approval is required by any federal or state law or regulation or the rules of any automated quotation system or stock exchange on which the Stock may then be quoted or listed, or if such shareholder approval is necessary in order for the Plan to continue to meet the requirements of Section 423 of the Code, and the Board may otherwise, in its discretion, determine to submit other such actions to shareholders for approval. However, without the consent of an affected Participant, no amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation, or termination of the Plan may materially and adversely affect the rights of such Participant with respect to outstanding Purchase Rights relating to any Offering Period that has been completed prior to such Board action. The foregoing notwithstanding, upon termination of the Plan the Board may (i) elect to terminate all outstanding Purchase Rights at such time as the Board may designate, and all amounts contributed to the Plan which remain in a Participant s Cash Account will be returned to the Participant (without interest) as promptly as practicable, or (ii) shorten the Offering Period to such period determined by the Board and use amounts credited to a Participant Cash Account to purchase Stock. 
 (f) No Rights to Participate No Shareholder Rights . No Participant or employee will have any claim to participate in the Plan with respect to Offering Periods that have not commenced, and the Company will have no obligation to continue the Plan. No Purchase Right will confer on any Participant any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company unless and until Stock is duly issued or transferred and delivered to the Participant (or credited to the Participant s Stock Account). 
 (g) Fractional Shares . Unless otherwise determined by the Board, purchases of Stock under the Plan executed by the Custodian may result in the crediting of fractional shares of Stock to the Participant s Stock Account. Such fractional shares will be computed to at least three decimal places. Fractional shares will not, however, be issued by the Company, and certificates representing fractional shares will not be delivered to Participants under any circumstances. 
 (h) Plan Year . The Plan will operate on a plan year that begins on January 1 and ends December 31 in each year. 
 (i) Governing Law . The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan will be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws, and applicable federal law. 
 (j) Effective Date . The Plan will become effective on the IPO Date, subject to the Plan being approved by shareholders of the Company, at a meeting by a vote sufficient to meet the requirements of Section 423(b)(2) of the Code. If the Plan is not approved in accordance with Section 423(b)(2) of the Code, each Participant s Purchase Right shall be void and amounts credited to the Participant s Cash Account shall be promptly returned to the Participant. 
 (k) Section 409A . Purchase Rights granted under the 423 Component are exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code. Purchase Rights granted under the Non-423 Component to U.S. taxpayers are intended to be exempt from the 
 11 

application of Section 409A of the Code under the short-term deferral exception and any ambiguities will be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. Subject to Section 9(l), Purchase Rights granted to U.S. taxpayers under the Non-423 Component will be subject to such terms and conditions that will permit such Purchase Rights to satisfy the requirements of the short-term deferral exception available under Section 409A of the Code, including the requirement that the Stock subject to a Purchase Right be delivered within the short-term deferral period. Subject to Section 9(l), in the case of a Participant who would otherwise be subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent the Board determines that a Purchase Right or its exercise, payment, settlement or deferral is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Purchase Right will be granted, exercised, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will comply with Section 409A of the Code, including without limitation any regulations or other guidance issued thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will have no liability to a Participant or any other party if the Purchase Right that is intended to be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Board with respect thereto. 
 (l) Tax Qualification and Limitations . Although the Company may endeavor to (i) qualify a Purchase Right for favorable tax treatment under the laws of the United States or jurisdictions outside of the United States or (ii) avoid adverse tax treatment (for example, under Section 409A of the Code), the Company makes no representation to that effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable tax treatment, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, including Section 9(k). The Company will be unconstrained in its corporate activities without regard to the potential negative tax impact on Participants under the Plan.
