 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 

as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023. The Company currently has limited
liquidity and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended
period of time. These factors among others, raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. The Company will require
additional financing moving forward and is pursuing various strategies to accomplish this, including seeking equity funding and/or debt
funding from private placement sources. Although management believes that it will be able to obtain the necessary funding to allow the
Company to remain a going concern through the methods discussed above, there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful.
Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses.
There are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue
as a going concern.

Going Concern 

We have not
attained profitable operations and are dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, the ability to raise equity
or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from our future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding
our ability to continue as a going concern . 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no
significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to stockholders . 

Future Financing 

The Company
will consider selling securities in the future to fund operations. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales
of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. 

We
regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. A complete summary
of these policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical
experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 

Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on
the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALIITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS 

Market risk
is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company's market risk arises primarily from the fact that the
area in which we do business is highly competitive and constantly evolving. The market in which we do business is highly competitive
and constantly evolving. We face competition from the larger and more established companies, from companies that have greater resources,
including but not limited to, more money, and greater ability to expand their markets also cut into our potential customers.
Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial strength, nationwide advertising coverage and
other resources that we do not have.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based
on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures(as defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the
"Exchange Act"), Anthony Lombardo, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer has concluded that as of
the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, September 30, 2024, filed on November 13, 2024, that such disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due to the lack of segregation of duties and lack of a formal review process that includes
multiple levels of review to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and
forms because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which we view as an integral
part of our disclosure controls and procedures. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. 

Under
the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 using the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

 A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30,
2024, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses under COSO and SEC rules are, as
described below: 

(1)
lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of independent directors on the Company s board of directors, resulting
in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; 

 (2)
inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting
and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. The aforementioned
potential material weaknesses were identified by the Company s Chief Financial Officer in connection with the preparation of our
financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and communicated the matters to our management and board of directors. 

Management
is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above control deficiency. 

Accordingly,
the Company concluded that this control deficiency resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

As
a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by COSO. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except
as noted above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation
required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our first quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
