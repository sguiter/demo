As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to stockholders. The Company plans to continue to operate so that it meets the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If the Company were to fail to meet these requirements, it would be subject to federal income tax. In management's opinion, the requirements to maintain these elections are being fulfilled. The Company is subject to certain state and local taxes. The Company has elected to treat its corporate subsidiary, SSG TRS LLC, as a taxable REIT subsidiary TRS ). In general, the Company s TRS may perform additional services for tenants and may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is subject to federal corporate income tax. The Company recognizes the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is more likely than not to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities. The Company has reviewed its tax positions and has concluded that liability for unrecognized tax benefits should be recorded related to uncertain tax positions taken on federal, state, and local income tax returns for open tax years (2021 2023), or are expected to be taken in the Company s 2024 tax returns.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Grants Performance-based restricted stock grants vest based on continued employment and the achievement of certain Funds from Operations, as adjusted AFFO and same store revenue growth SSRG goals by the Company during the year of the grant. Each of these performance components are weighted and are measured over the performance cycle, which is defined as the year ending on December 31st in the year of the grant. At the end of the performance cycle, the financial performance components are reviewed to determine the number of shares actually earned, which can be as low as of shares granted and up to a maximum of of shares granted. The shares which are earned will remain subject to quarterly vesting during the remaining time vesting period. Dividends paid by the Company prior to the determination of how many shares are earned will be retained by the Company and released only with respect to earned shares. If a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan) occurs the number of shares earned will equal the greater of the number of shares granted and the number of shares which would have been earned based on the AFFO and SSRG through the date of the Change in Control. If following a Change in Control, a grantee is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the grantee with Good Reason (as each is defined in the Plan), all unvested restricted stock will fully vest.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis Overview 
 The Company is a self-administered and self-managed REIT that owns, operates, manages, acquires, and redevelops self storage properties stores or properties in the United States. Our stores are designed to offer affordable, easily accessible, and secure storage space for residential and commercial customers. As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned and operated, or managed, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, thirteen stores located in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Oklahoma. The Company was formerly registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act as a non-diversified, closed end management investment company. The Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC order approving the Company s application to deregister from the 1940 Act was granted on January 19, 2016. On January 19, 2016, the Company changed its name to Global Self Storage, Inc. from Self Storage Group, Inc., changed its SEC registration from an investment company to an operating company reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and listed its common stock on NASDAQ under the symbol SELF . 
 The Company was incorporated on December 12, 1996 under the laws of the state of Maryland. The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). To the extent the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax, with certain limited exceptions, on its taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders. 
 Our store operations generated most of our net income for all periods presented herein. Accordingly, a significant portion of management s time is devoted to seeking to maximize cash flows from our existing stores, as well as seeking investments in additional stores. The Company expects to continue to earn a majority of its gross income from its store operations as its current store operations continue to develop and as it makes additional store acquisitions. Over time, the Company expects to divest its remaining portfolio of investment securities and use the proceeds to acquire and operate additional stores. The Company expects its income from investment securities to continue to decrease as it continues to divest its holdings of investment securities. 
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Our financing strategy is to minimize the cost of our capital in order to maximize the returns generated for our stockholders. For future acquisitions, the Company may employ various financing and capital raising alternatives including, but not limited to, debt and/or equity offerings, credit facilities, mortgage financing, and joint ventures with third parties.

There were no shares of common stock sold during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 under the Sales Agreement. 
 On July 6, 2024, certain wholly owned subsidiaries Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries of the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Facility Loan Agreement (collectively, the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement between the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries and The Huntington National Bank, successor by merger to TCF National Bank Second Amended Credit Facility Lender ). Under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries may borrow from the Second Amended Credit Facility Lender in the principal amount of up to 15 million, reduced to 14.75 million and 14.5 million in years 2 and 3, respectively, pursuant to a promissory note (the Second Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note ). The Second Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 3 plus the greater of the One Month SOFR or 0.25 and is due to mature on July 6, 2027, with an option to extend the maturity to July 6, 2028. An annual unused facility fee is charged based on the daily average of the unadvanced amount of the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement during the trailing twelve month period ending each June 30. The fee will be calculated at 0.25 per annum if the daily average of the unadvanced amount of the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement during such trailing twelve month period was greater than fifty percent, and will be calculated at 0.15 if the daily average of the unadvanced amount of the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement during such trailing twelve month period was less than or equal to fifty percent. The obligations under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries. The Company entered into a second amended and restated guaranty of payment as of July 6, 2024 Second Amended Credit Facility Guaranty, and together with the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Second Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note and related instruments, the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents to guarantee the payment to the Second Amended Credit Facility Lender of certain obligations of the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. The Company and the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries paid customary fees and expenses in connection with their entry into the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents. The Company also maintains a bank account at the Second Amended Credit Facility Lender. As of September 30, 2024, we have no withdrawn proceeds under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. We currently intend to strategically withdraw proceeds available under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement to fund: (i) the acquisition of additional self storage properties, (ii) expansions at existing self storage properties in our portfolio, and/or (iii) joint ventures with third parties for the acquisition and expansion of self storage properties. 
 On July 8, 2024, in connection with the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Company entered into a swap transaction for an interest rate derivative with Huntington (the "Cap Rate Agreement") effective July 10, 2024. The notional amount and strike is 7,500,000 and 5.25 , respectively. The cost of the initial premium was 57,000 and will be carried as an asset on the balance sheet at fair value. The Cap Rate Agreement terminates on July 6, 2027. 
 We continue to actively review a number of store and store portfolio acquisition opportunities and have been working to further develop and expand our current stores. We did not complete any acquisitions in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, we may pursue third-party management opportunities of properties owned by certain affiliates or joint venture partners for a fee, and utilize such relationships with third-party owners as a source for future acquisitions and investment opportunities. As of September 30, 2024, under our third-party management platform, Global MaxManagement SM , we managed one third-party owned property, which was previously rebranded as Global Self Storage, had 137,318-leasable square feet and was comprised of 619 climate-controlled and non-climate-controlled units located in Edmond, Oklahoma. 
 We expect we will have sufficient cash from current sources to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months because our capital resources currently exceed our projected expenses for the next twelve months. However, we may opt to supplement our equity capital and increase potential returns to our stockholders through the use of prudent levels of borrowings. We may use debt when the available terms and conditions are favorable to long-term investing and well-aligned with our strategic business plan. 
 The Company currently has capital resources totaling approximately 25.1 million, comprised of 6.9 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and 3.2 million of marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, and 15 million available for 
 23 

withdrawal under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement which matures on July 6, 2027. Capital resources derived from retained cash flow have been and are currently expected to continue to be negligible. Retained operating cash flow represents our expected cash flow provided by operating activities, less stockholder distributions and capital expenditures to maintain stores. These capital resources allow us to continue to execute our strategic business plan, which includes funding acquisitions, either directly or through joint ventures; expansion projects at our existing properties; and broadening our revenue base and pipeline of potential acquisitions through developing Global MaxManagement SM , our third-party management platform. Our board of directors regularly reviews our strategic business plan, including topics and metrices like capital formation, debt versus equity ratios, dividend policy, use of capital and debt, funds from operations FFO and adjusted funds from operations AFFO performance, and optimal cash levels. See the section titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for the definition and use of FFO and AFFO. 
 We expect that the results of our operations will be affected by a number of factors. Many of the factors that will affect our operating results are beyond our control. The Company and its properties could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to, among other things, public health crises, natural disasters and geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, financial and credit market volatility and disruptions, inflationary pressures, rising interest rate fluctuations, supply chain issues, labor shortages and recessionary concerns.

Past market price performance and distribution levels do not guarantee similar results in the future. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Funds from Operations FFO and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT and are considered helpful measures of REIT performance by REITs and many REIT analysts. NAREIT defines FFO as a REIT s net income, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, and adding back real estate depreciation and amortization. The Company also excludes changes in unrealized gains or losses on marketable equity securities. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful. However, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, FFO should be considered along with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company s financial statements. 
 Adjusted FFO AFFO and AFFO per share are non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, business development, capital raising, and acquisition related costs and non-recurring items, which we believe are not indicative of the Company s operating results. AFFO and AFFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. AFFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. We present AFFO because we believe it is a helpful measure in understanding our results of operations insofar as we believe that the items noted above that are included in FFO, but excluded from AFFO, are not indicative of our ongoing operating results. We also believe that the analyst community considers our AFFO (or similar measures using different terminology) when evaluating us. Because other REITs or real estate companies may not compute AFFO in the same manner as we do, and may use different terminology, our computation of AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies. However, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, AFFO should be considered along with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company s financial statements.

We believe net operating income or NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to, among other things, capital allocations, determining current store values, evaluating store performance, and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market store operating results. In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost. NOI is defined as net store earnings before general and administrative expenses, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. 
 NOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results.

 Same-Store Self Storage Operations 
 We consider our same-store portfolio to consist of only those stores owned and operated on a stabilized basis at the beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved an occupancy rate that we believe, based on our assessment of market-specific data, is representative of similar self storage assets in the applicable market for a full year measured as of the most recent January 1 and has not been significantly damaged by natural disaster or undergone significant renovation or expansion. We believe that same-store results are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in store-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, or new ground-up developments. At September 30, 2024, we owned twelve same-store properties and zero non same-store properties. The Company believes that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to, variances in occupancy, rental revenue, operating expenses, and NOI, stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions, or completed developments. Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of the Company s stores as a whole. 
 Same-store occupancy at September 30, 2024 increased by 1.7 to 91.5 from 89.8 at September 30, 2023. 
 Same-store revenues increased by 3.6 and 1.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same periods in 2023. Same-store cost of operations decreased by 0.8 and increased 5.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same periods in 2023. Same-store NOI increased by 6.3 and decreased 0.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same periods in 2023. The increase in same-store NOI during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to an increase in revenues and decrease in cost of operations. 
 We believe that our results were driven by, among other things, our internet and digital marketing initiatives which helped maintain our overall average same-store occupancy of approximately 92 as of September 30, 2024. Also, contributing to our results were our customer service efforts which we believe were essential in building local brand loyalty, resulting in strong referral and word-of-mouth market demand for our storage units and services. Another contributing factor to our results was our competitor move-in rate metrics analysis which employs internet data scraping and other methods to help keep our storage unit move-in rates in the market, and our revenue rate management program which helped increase existing tenant rates while optimizing store occupancy. 
 These results are summarized as follows:

Analysis of Same-Store Revenue 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, same-store revenue increased 3.6 , or 110,550, and 1.5 , or 139,695, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. Same-store average overall square foot occupancy for all of the Company s same-store properties increased to 91.5 at September 30, 2024, up from 89.8 at September 30, 2023. 
 We believe that our focus on maintaining high occupancy helps us to maximize rental income at our properties. We seek to maintain an average square foot occupancy level at or above 90 by regularly adjusting the rental rates and promotions offered to attract new tenants as well as adjusting our online marketing efforts in seeking to generate sufficient move-in volume to replace tenants that vacate. Demand may fluctuate due to various local and regional factors, including the overall economy. Demand is generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months and, as a result, rental rates charged to new tenants are typically higher in the summer months than in the winter months. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we observed no material degradation in rent collections. However, we believe that our bad debt losses could increase from historical levels, due to (i) cumulative stress (such as inflation, recession fears, etc.) on our customers financial capacity and (ii) reduced rent recoveries from auctioned units. 
 29 

We may experience a change in the move-out patterns of our long-term customers due to economic uncertainty. This could lead to lower occupancies and rent roll down as long-term customers are replaced with new customers at lower rates. 
 We currently expect rental income growth, if any, to come from a combination of the following: (i) continued existing tenant rent increases, (ii) higher rental rates charged to new tenants, (iii) lower promotional discounts, and (iv) higher occupancies. Our future rental income growth will likely also be dependent upon many factors for each market that we operate in, including, among other things, demand for self storage space, the level of competitor supply of self storage space, and the average length of stay of our tenants. Increasing existing tenant rental rates, generally on an annual basis, is a key component of our revenue growth. We typically determine the level of rental increases based upon our expectations regarding the impact of existing tenant rate increases on incremental move-outs. We currently expect existing tenant rent increases for the remainder of 2024, if any, to be similar to those in the prior year. 
 It is difficult to predict trends in move-in, move-out, in place contractual rents, and occupancy levels. Current trends, when viewed in the short-term, are volatile and not necessarily predictive of our revenues going forward because they may be subject to many short-term factors. Such factors include, among others, initial move-in rates, seasonal factors, unit size and geographical mix of the specific tenants moving in or moving out, the length of stay of the tenants moving in or moving out, changes in our pricing strategies, and the degree and timing of rate increases previously passed to existing tenants. 
 Importantly, we continue to refine our ongoing revenue rate management program which includes regular internet data scraping of local competitors prices. We do this in seeking to maintain our competitive market price advantage for our various sized storage units at our stores. This program helps us in seeking to maximize each store s occupancies and our self storage revenue and NOI. We believe that, through our various marketing initiatives, we can continue to attract high quality, long term tenants who we expect will be storing with us for years. As of September 30, 2024, our average tenant duration of stay was approximately 3.4 years, which was up from 3.3 years as of September 30, 2023. 
 Analysis of Same-Store Cost of Operations 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, same-store cost of operations decreased 0.8 , or 9,117, and increased 5.4 , or 181,853, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. This decrease in same-store cost of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to decreased expenses for real estate property taxes. 
 Employment. On-site store manager, regional manager, and district manager payroll expense increased 3.8 , or 12,601, and 9.1 , or 89,437, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. The increase was due primarily to routine employee hiring and inflationary increases in compensation rates for existing employees. We currently expect inflationary increases in compensation rates for existing employees and other increases in compensation costs as we potentially add new stores. 
 Real Estate Property Tax . Store property tax expense decreased 6.4 , or 27,165, and increased 0.4 , or 4,693, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. When compared to store property tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we currently expect store property tax expense to be consistent during the rest of 2024. See the section titled Property Tax Expenses at Dolton, IL for additional detail regarding property tax relief obtained for our Dolton, IL property in 2024, which will partially offset our increased real estate property taxes. 
 Administrative . We classify administrative expenses as bank charges related to processing the stores cash receipts, credit card fees, repairs and maintenance, utilities, landscaping, alarm monitoring and trash removal. Administrative expenses decreased 2.2 , or 4,727, and increased 1.5 , or 9,439, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. We experienced a decrease in administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to decreased repairs and maintenance expenses. We currently expect moderate increases in other direct store costs in 2024. 
 Repairs and Maintenance. Repairs and maintenance expense decreased 19.8 , or 10,883, and 8.2 , or 11,998, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. These expenses decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same period in 2023 primarily due to one-off repairs and maintenance completed in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Utilities. Our utility expenses are currently comprised of electricity, oil, and gas costs, which vary by store and are dependent upon energy prices and usage levels. Changes in usage levels are driven primarily by weather and temperature. Also, affecting our utilities expenses over time is our ongoing LED light replacement program at all of our stores which has already resulted in lower electricity usage. Utilities expense decreased 2.2 , or 1,370, and 4.8 , or 10,032, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. It is difficult to estimate future utility costs because weather, temperature, and energy prices are volatile and unpredictable. However, based upon current trends and expectations regarding commercial electricity 
 30 

rates, we currently expect inflationary increases in rates combined with lower usage resulting in similar utility costs for the remainder of 2024. 
 Landscaping. Landscaping expenses, which include snow removal costs, increased 2.2 , or 571, and 15.8 , or 11,880, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. The increase in landscaping expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to an increase of one-off snow removal and inflationary increases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Landscaping expense levels are dependent upon many factors such as weather conditions, which can impact landscaping needs including, among other things, snow removal, inflation in material and labor costs, and random events. We currently expect inflationary increases in landscaping expense for the remainder of 2024, excluding snow removal expense, which is primarily weather dependent and unpredictable. 
 Marketing . Marketing expense is comprised principally of internet advertising and the operating costs of our 24/7 kiosk and telephone call and reservation center. Marketing expense varies based upon demand, occupancy levels, and other factors. Internet advertising, in particular, can increase or decrease significantly in the short term in response to these factors. Marketing expense decreased 5.4 , or 4,604, and 1.3 , or 3,420, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. Marketing expense decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to decreased spending on digital advertising. Based upon current trends in move-ins, move-outs, and occupancies, we currently expect marketing expense to increase at a nominal rate for the remainder of 2024. 
 General . Other direct store costs include general and administrative expenses incurred at the stores. General expenses include items such as store insurance, business license costs, and the cost of operating each store s rental office including supplies and telephone and data communication lines. General expenses increased 20.7 , or 19,112, and 38.4 , or 92,729, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increased expense for property insurance, recruitment and training, uniforms, and branded merchandise to support our customer loyalty program. We currently expect moderate increases in direct store costs during the remainder of 2024. 
 Lien Administration. Lien administration expenses increased 21.0 , or 1,142, and 6.6 , or 955, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. 
 Property Tax Expenses at Dolton, IL 
 
 Late in the third quarter of 2017, our Dolton, IL property was reassessed by the municipality and separately, our Class 8 tax incentive renewal hearing was held. As a result of those two events, our Dolton, IL property was reassessed at approximately 52 higher and the Class 8 tax incentive was not renewed. These events were applied retroactively to take effect on January 1, 2017. Property tax expenses have increased to 399,000 during 2020, 417,000 during 2021, 532,000 during 2022, and 559,000 during 2023. The Class 8 tax incentive phased out over the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. In 2024, tax relief was granted resulting in an approximate 17.9 reduction in tax liability to the real estate property taxes for our Dolton, IL property. We are continuing to appeal the property tax reassessment and our Class 8 tax incentive renewal status for further tax relief. However, there is no guarantee that either the assessment will be reduced or our Class 8 tax incentive status will be reinstated.

 Analysis of Global Self Storage Store Expansions and Redevelopment Operations 
 
 In addition to actively reviewing a number of store and portfolio acquisition candidates, we have been working to further redevelop and expand our current stores. In 2020, we completed three expansion / conversion projects at our properties located in Millbrook, NY, McCordsville, IN, and West Henrietta, NY. In 2021 and 2023, we completed conversion projects at our property located in Lima, OH. 
 In 2019, the Company broke ground on the Millbrook, NY expansion, which added approximately 11,800 leasable square feet of all-climate-controlled units. Upon completion in February 2020, the Millbrook, NY store's area occupancy dropped from approximately 88.6 to approximately 45.5 . As of June 30, 2021, the Millbrook, NY store s total area occupancy was approximately 95.4 . 
 In the first quarter of 2020, the Company began reviewing plans to convert certain commercially-leased space to all-climate-controlled units at the McCordsville, IN property. In April 2020, the Company commenced such conversion, which resulted in a new total of 535 units and 76,360 leasable square feet at the McCordsville, IN property. Upon completion in June 2020, the McCordsville, IN store's total area occupancy dropped from what would have been approximately 97.4 to approximately 79.1 . As of June 30, 2021, the McCordsville, IN store s total area occupancy was approximately 94.7 . 
 Our West Henrietta, NY store expansion project, completed in August 2020, added approximately 7,300 leasable square feet of drive-up storage units. Upon completion of the expansion project, West Henrietta, NY s total area occupancy dropped from approximately 89.6 to approximately 77.9 . As of June 30, 2021, the West Henrietta, NY store s total area occupancy was approximately 89.1 . 
 In 2021, the Company began reviewing plans to convert certain commercially-leased spaces to approximately 3,000 leasable square feet of all-climate-controlled units at the Lima, OH property. In July 2021, the Company completed such conversion, resulting in a new total of 756 units and 96,883 leasable square feet at the Lima, OH property. Upon completion, total area occupancy was approximately 94.8 . This conversion did not constitute a significant renovation or expansion because it only added approximately 3,000 leasable square feet of self storage to the property. As such, our Lima, OH property remained a same store property. 
 In 2022, the Company began reviewing plans to convert certain commercially-leased spaces to approximately 2,500 leasable square feet of all-climate-controlled units at the Lima, OH property. In January 2023, the Company completed such conversion, resulting 
 32 

in a new total of 767 units and 94,928 leasable square feet at the Lima, OH property. Upon completion, total area occupancy was approximately 91.1 . This conversion did not constitute a significant renovation or expansion because it only added approximately 2,500 leasable square feet of self storage to the property. As such, our Lima, OH property remained a same store property. 
 Analysis of Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) 
 Unrealized gains and losses on the Company s investment in marketable equity securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were a gain of 403,935 and a loss of 165,266, respectively. As we continue to acquire and/or develop additional stores, as part of the funding for such activities, we may liquidate our investment in marketable equity securities and potentially realize gains or losses. As of September 30, 2024, our cumulative unrealized gain on marketable equity securities was 2,423,477. There were no realized gains or losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4.	Control s and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of disclosure controls and procedures in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 We have a disclosure controls and procedures committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which meets as necessary and is responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining our disclosure obligations on a timely basis. 
 The disclosure controls and procedures committee carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during our most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
