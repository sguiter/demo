 million upfront payment in January 2022 and are eligible to receive up to an additional million in developmental, regulatory, and commercialization milestone payments. We also are eligible to receive tiered, double-digit-percentage royalties on net sales of OpRegen in the U.S. and other major markets. On May 7, 2024, we entered into a service agreement with Genentech pursuant to which we will provide supplemental clinical, technical, training, manufacturing, and procurement services to support the ongoing advancement and optimization of the OpRegen program. In September 2024, Roche and Genentech announced receipt of Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy RMAT designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA for OpRegen for the treatment of GA secondary to dry AMD. Our most advanced unpartnered product candidate is OPC1, an allogeneic oligodendrocyte progenitor cell therapy designed to improve recovery following a spinal cord injury SCI ). OPC1 has been tested in two clinical trials to date: a five patient Phase 1 clinical trial in acute thoracic SCI, where all subjects are followed for at least 10 years; and a 25 patient Phase 1/2a multicenter clinical trial in subacute cervical SCI, where all subjects were evaluated for at least two years. Results from both studies have been published in the Journal of Neurosurgery Spine. OPC1 clinical development has been supported in part by a million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine CIRM ). We plan to apply for additional funding from CIRM for continued clinical development of OPC1 for the treatment of SCI. In December 2023, we filed an Investigational New Drug IND amendment for OPC1 as it relates to our proposed DOSED (Delivery of Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells for Spinal Cord Injury: Evaluation of a Novel Device) clinical study, to evaluate the safety and utility of a novel spinal cord delivery device to administer OPC1 to the spinal parenchyma in subacute and chronic SCI patients. In March 2024, we received written correspondence from the FDA, advising us that due to significant workload and conflicting PDUFA priorities at the agency, its review of our IND amendment and the DOSED study protocol is still ongoing. Since that time we have been engaging with the FDA to aid in their review, including through an informal teleconference meeting with the CBER and CDRH divisions of the FDA held on November 12, 2024. Based on that discussion we plan to submit an additional amendment to the IND and final protocol with clarifying information to the FDA by the end of the year. We currently anticipate that the FDA will complete its review of this amendment in Q1 2025 and we do not expect any further feedback or additional information requests that would delay start of the study. We currently plan to commence enrolling the DOSED study as soon as feasible after submitting these updates. Our pipeline of allogeneic, or off-the-shelf , cell therapy programs currently includes: RG6501 (OpRegen) , an allogeneic RPE cell replacement therapy currently in a Phase 2a multicenter, open-label, single arm clinical trial, being conducted by Roche, for the treatment of GA secondary to AMD, also known as atrophic or dry AMD.

We are recognizing the million upfront payment under the Roche Agreement utilizing an input method of costs incurred over total estimated costs to be incurred. At each reporting period, we update our total estimated collaboration costs, and any resulting adjustments are recorded on a cumulative basis which would affect revenue and deferred revenue in the period of adjustment. We believe the input methodology represents the most appropriate measure of progress towards satisfaction of the identified performance obligations. For contracts with customers including collaboration partners which are within the scope of Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations as of September 30, 2024 was million, of which million is reported as deferred revenues. The million is expected to be converted to revenue substantially by December 2026.

Total stock-based compensation expense 

As of September 30, 2024, total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options and unvested RSUs under all equity plans, was million, which is expected to be recogniz ed as expense over a weighted average period of approximately years for stock options and years for RSUs. Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share Attributable to Common Shareholders Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income or loss attributable to Lineage common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, net of stock options and RSUs, subject to repurchase by Lineage, if any, during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to Lineage common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive common shares issuable under any outstanding stock options, RSUs, warrants (using the treasury-stock method), or convertible preferred stock (using the if-converted method). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Lineage reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders, and therefore, all potentially dilutive common shares were considered antidilutive for those periods.

Collaborations Roche Agreement In December 2021, Lineage entered into the Roche Agreement, wherein Lineage granted to Roche exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize RPE cell therapies, including Lineage s proprietary cell therapy known as OpRegen, for the treatment of ocular disorders, including GA secondary to AMD. Under the terms of the Roche Agreement, Roche paid Lineage a million upfront payment and Lineage is eligible to receive up to an additional million in developmental, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments. Lineage also is eligible for tiered, double-digit-percentage royalties on net sales of OpRegen in the U.S. and other major markets. All regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalty payments are subject to the existence of certain intellectual property rights that cover OpRegen at the time such payments would otherwise become due, and the royalty payments on net sales of OpRegen are subject to financial offsets based on the existence of competing products. Roche assumed responsibility for further clinical development and commercialization of 

 25 

LINEAGE CELL THERAPEUTICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED) 

 million upfront payment from Roche. Subsequently, Lineage, via Cell Cure, paid million to the IIA, and million to Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd. Hadasit ). Such payments were made in accordance with obligations under the Innovation Law (as discussed below) and under the terms of Cell Cure s agreements with Hadasit (as discussed below). The payment obligation to Hadasit was reduced by million in accordance with the provisions of such agreements discussed below that reduce the sublicensing fee payable to Hadasit for costs related to Lineage s performance obligations under the Roche Agreement. To the extent such costs are not incurred within five years after the execution of the Roche Agreement, Cell Cure will be required to pay Hadasit of the amount of costs not incurred. ITI Collaboration Agreement In April 2021, Lineage entered into a collaborative agreement with Immunomic Therapeutics, Inc. ITI whereby Lineage agreed to perform up to approximately million worth of certain research, development, manufacturing, and oversight activities related to the development of an allogeneic VAC-CMV product candidate. ITI will reimburse Lineage for these costs and full-time employee costs for the manufacturing of the VAC-CMV product candidate. As of September 30, 2024, Lineage has a remaining performance obligation of approxim ately milli on for the aforementioned activities. Upon execution of the agreement in April 2021, million was paid by ITI to Lineage. Upon delivery of research-grade VAC-CMV product generated by Lineage, ITI paid an additional million in August 2021. ITI is currently evaluating its next step under the agreement. Agreements with Hadasit and IIA The OpRegen program was supported in part with licenses to technology obtained from Hadasit, the technology transfer company of Hadassah Medical Center, and through a series of research grants from the IIA, an independent agency created to address the needs of global innovation ecosystems. A subset of the intellectual property underlying OpRegen was originally generated at Hadassah Medical Center and licensed to Cell Cure for further development. Under the Encouragement of Research, Development and Technological Innovation in the Industry Law 5744, and the regulations, guidelines, rules, procedures and benefit tracks thereunder (collectively, the Innovation Law ), annual research and development programs that meet specified criteria and were approved by a committee of the IIA were eligible for grants. The grants awarded were typically up to of the project s expenditures, as determined by the IIA committee and subject to the benefit track under which the grant was awarded. The terms of the grants under the Innovation Law generally require that the products developed as part of the programs under which the grants were given be manufactured in Israel. The know-how developed thereunder may not be transferred outside of Israel unless prior written approval is received from the IIA. Transfer of IIA-funded know-how outside of Israel is subject to approval and payment of a redemption fee to the IIA calculated according to formulas provided under the Innovation Law. In November 2021, the IIA research committee approved an application made by Cell Cure with respect to the grant of an exclusive license and transfer of the technological know-how for OpRegen to Roche. Under the provisions for the redemption fee, Lineage paid the IIA approximately of the upfront payment it received under the Roche Agreement, or million, and is obligated to pay the IIA approximately of any milestone and royalty payments which may be received under the Roche Agreement, up to an aggregate cap on all payments, such cap growing over time via interest accrual until paid in full. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate cap amount was approxima tely million. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated License Agreement, dated June 15, 2017, between Cell Cure and Hadasit, and a certain letter agreement entered into on December 17, 2021, Cell Cure paid a sublicensing fee to Hadasit of million or of the million upfront payment under the Roche Agreement (subject to certain reductions), and Cell Cure is obligated to pay Hadasit 

 26 

LINEAGE CELL THERAPEUTICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED) 

 of all milestone payments Lineage receives under the Roche Agreement (subject to certain reductions, including for costs related to Lineage s performance obligations under the Roche Agreement), and (ii) up to of all royalty payments (subject to a maximum payment of 5 of net sales of products), Lineage receives under the Roche Agreement. The letter agreement generally terminates upon the termination of the Roche Agreement. Second Amendment to Clinical Trial and Option Agreement and License Agreement with Cancer Research UK In May 2020, Lineage and Asterias entered into a Second Amendment to the Clinical Trial and Option Agreement (the Second CTOA Amendment with CRUK and Cancer Research Technology CRT ). The Second CTOA Amendment amended the initial agreement and the first amendment to the Clinical Trial and Option Agreement, each of which is dated September 8, 2014, between Asterias, CRUK and CRT. Pursuant to the Second CTOA Amendment, Lineage assumed all obligations of Asterias and exercised early its option to acquire data generated in the Phase 1 clinical trial of VAC2 in non-small cell lung cancer being conducted by CRUK. Lineage and CRT effectuated the option by simultaneously entering into a license agreement (the CRT License Agreement pursuant to which Lineage paid a signature fee of (approximately million based upon exchange rates in effect when the fee was paid). For the primary licensed product for the first indication, the CRT License Agreement provides for milestone fees of up to based upon initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial and the filing for regulatory approval and up to in sales-based milestones payments. Additional milestone fees and sales-based milestone payments would be payable for other products or indications, and mid-single-digit royalty payments are payable on sales of commercial products. Either party may terminate the CRT License Agreement for the uncured material breach of the other party. CRT may terminate the CRT License Agreement in the case of Lineage s insolvency or if Lineage ceases all development and commercialization of all products under the CRT License Agreement. Other Contingent Obligations We have obligations under license agreements and grants received from government entities to make future payments to third parties, which become due and payable on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones or on the sublicense of our rights to another party. These commitments include sublicense fees, milestone payments, redemption fees and royalties. Sublicense fees are payable to licensors or government entities when we sublicense underlying intellectual property to third parties; the fees are based on a percentage of the license-related revenue we receive from sublicensees. Milestone payments are due to licensors or government entities upon the future achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Redemption fees due to the IIA under the Innovation Law are due upon receipt of any milestone or royalty payment received in respect of IIA-funded programs. Royalties are payable to licensors or government entities based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products. As of September 30, 2024, we have not included these commitments on our condensed consolidated balance sheet because the achievement and timing of these events are not fixed and determinable. Litigation General From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. While management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, cash flows, or overall trends in results of operations, legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or outcomes could occur that have individually or in aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. We are not currently subject to any pending material litigation, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business. Asterias Merger In November 2018, Lineage, Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. Asterias ), and Patrick Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Lineage, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger pursuant to which Lineage agreed to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Asterias in a stock-for-stock transaction (the Asterias Merger ). The Asterias Merger closed in March 2019. In October 2019, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against the company and certain other named defendants challenging the Asterias Merger. In February 2023, the court approved a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement pursuant to which, Lineage and certain insurers of the defendants paid million (the Settlement Amount into a fund created for the benefit of the purported 

 27 

LINEAGE CELL THERAPEUTICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED) 

 million of the Settlement Amount was funded by certain insurers and approximately million was paid by Lineage during the first quarter of 2023. Lineage and all defendants have denied, and continue to deny, the claims alleged in the lawsuit and the settlement does not reflect or constitute any admission, concession, presumption, proof, evidence or finding of any liability, fault, wrongdoing or injury or damages, or of any wrongful conduct, acts or omissions on the part any defendant. Premvia Litigation Settlement In July 2019, the Company, along with other named defendants, was sued in the Superior Court of the State of California in a matter captioned Gonzalez v. Aronowitz, M.D., et al . The plaintiff asserted medical negligence and product liability causes of action relating to the 2017 and 2018 use in a clinical trial of a product candidate, Premvia, that the Company is no longer developing and has no plans to pursue, and that is not related to the cell therapy candidates the Company currently is developing. In February 2023, the Company and the other defendants each entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiff pursuant to which the defendants without admitting any liability, which the defendants expressly denied, each agreed to pay specified amounts to the plaintiff in exchange for a full settlement and release and discharge of claims. The Company s insurance covered the full amount paid by the Company excluding the insurance deductible. HBL Books and Records Request On April 17, 2023, Cell Cure received a motion for disclosure of documents pursuant to Section 198A of the Israeli Companies Law 5759-1999. The motion was filed in the district court in Tel Aviv-Yafo (the Court by HBL Hadasit Bio-Holdings Ltd. HBL ), currently an approximately 5 shareholder of Cell Cure. According to the motion, the requested production of documents is intended to allow HBL to examine the possibility of pursuing a derivative action related to, among other things, the validity of an intercompany Collaboration and License Agreement (the Intercompany Agreement entered into between Lineage and Cell Cure pursuant to which Cell Cure conveyed certain rights and other assets to Lineage, and Lineage agreed to undertake certain liabilities and obligations of Cell Cure relating to the OpRegen program. In its motion, HBL alleges, among other things, that Lineage, in its capacity as Cell Cure s controlling shareholder, and members of Cell Cure s board of directors caused damage to Cell Cure because the Intercompany Agreement was an interested party transaction that was not fairly priced and exploits Cell Cure s resources for the benefit of Lineage. The motion seeks an order to compel Cell Cure to disclose and deliver to HBL the documents described in the motion, such additional, cumulative, or alternative relief as the court deems appropriate, and reimbursement of HBL s expenses, including attorneys fees. The Court held a hearing on the motion on March 14, 2024 at which the Court proposed, and the parties agreed, to retain a third-party valuation firm to assess the fairness of the valuation that was performed in support of the Intercompany Agreement. It is impossible at this time to assess whether the outcome of this proceeding will have a material adverse effect on Lineage s consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Therefore, in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, Lineage has not recorded any accrual for a contingent liability associated with this legal proceeding based on its belief that a liability, while possible, is not probable nor estimable, and any range of potential contingent liability amounts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Lineage records legal expenses as incurred. Employment Contracts Lineage has employment agreements with all of its executive officers. Under the provisions of the agreements, Lineage may be required to incur severance obligations for matters relating to changes in control, as defined in the agreements, and involuntary terminations. Indemnification In the normal course of business, Lineage may agree to indemnify and reimburse other parties, typically Lineage s clinical research organizations, investigators, clinical sites, and suppliers, for losses and expenses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties arising from claims of third parties in connection with the use or testing of Lineage s products and services. Indemnification could also cover third party infringement claims with respect to patent rights, copyrights, or other intellectual property pertaining to Lineage products and services. The term of these indemnification agreements generally continue in effect after the termination or expiration of the particular research, development, services, or license agreement to which they relate. In addition, Lineage has entered into

It em 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and notes thereto included in this report and our audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the 2023 10-K. Past operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods. 
 The following discussion includes forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, above. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and from historical results depending upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 10-K, and in our subsequent filings with the SEC, including any discussed in Part II, Item 1A of this report under the heading Risk Factors. 
 All information presented in this report is based on our fiscal year. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to our fiscal years ending December 31 and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. 
 Organization and Business Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel allogeneic, or off-the-shelf , cell therapies to address unmet medical needs. Our programs are based on our proprietary, cell-based technology platform, and associated development, formulation, delivery and manufacturing capabilities. From this platform, we design, develop, manufacture, and test specialized human cells with anatomical and physiological functions similar or identical to cells found naturally in the human body. The cells we manufacture are created by applying directed differentiation protocols to established, well-characterized, and self-renewing pluripotent cell lines. These protocols generate cells with characteristics associated with specific and desired developmental lineages. Cells derived from such lineages which are relevant to the underlying condition are transplanted into patients in an effort to (a) replace or support cells that are absent or dysfunctional due to degenerative disease, aging, or traumatic injury, and (b) restore or augment the patient s functional activity. 
 Our business strategy is to efficiently leverage our technology platform and our development and manufacturing capabilities to advance our programs internally or in conjunction with strategic partners to further enhance their value and probability of success. 
 A significant area of focus is a collaboration we entered into with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group (collectively or individually, Roche or Genentech ), under which our lead cell therapy program known as OpRegen , is being developed for the treatment of ocular disorders, including geographic atrophy GA secondary to age-related macular degeneration AMD ). OpRegen (also known as RG6501) is a suspension of human allogeneic retinal pigmented epithelial RPE cells and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2a multicenter clinical trial in patients with GA secondary to AMD. OpRegen subretinal delivery has the potential to counteract RPE cell loss in areas of GA lesions by supporting retinal cell health and improving retinal structure and function. Under the terms of the Collaboration and License Agreement we entered into with Roche in December 2021 (the Roche Agreement ), we received a 50.0 million upfront payment in January 2022 and are eligible to receive up to an additional 620.0 million in developmental, regulatory, and commercialization milestone payments. We also are eligible to receive tiered, double-digit-percentage royalties on net sales of OpRegen in the U.S. and other major markets. On May 7, 2024, we entered into a service agreement with Genentech pursuant to which we will provide supplemental clinical, technical, training, manufacturing, and procurement services to support the ongoing advancement and optimization of the OpRegen program. In September 2024, Roche and Genentech announced receipt of Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy RMAT designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA for OpRegen for the treatment of GA secondary to dry AMD. 
 Our most advanced unpartnered product candidate is OPC1, an allogeneic oligodendrocyte progenitor cell therapy designed to improve recovery following a spinal cord injury SCI ). OPC1 has been tested in two clinical trials to date; a five patient Phase 1 clinical trial in acute thoracic SCI, where all subjects are followed for at least 10 years, and a 25 patient Phase 1/2a multicenter clinical trial in subacute cervical SCI, where all subjects were evaluated for at least two years. Results from both studies have been published in the Journal of Neurosurgery Spine. OPC1 clinical development has been supported in part by a 14.3 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine CIRM ). We plan to apply for additional funding from CIRM for continued clinical development of OPC1 for the treatment of SCI. In December 2023, we filed an Investigational New Drug IND amendment for OPC1 as it relates to our proposed DOSED (Delivery of Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells for Spinal Cord Injury: Evaluation of a Novel Device) clinical study, to evaluate the safety and utility of a novel spinal cord delivery device to administer OPC1 to the spinal parenchyma in subacute and chronic SCI patients. In March 2024, we received written correspondence from the FDA, advising us that due to significant workload and conflicting PDUFA priorities at the agency, its review of our IND amendment and the DOSED study protocol is still ongoing. Since that time we have been engaging with the FDA to aid in their review, including through an informal teleconference meeting with the CBER and CDRH divisions of the FDA held on November 12, 2024. Based on that discussion we plan to submit an additional 
 30 

amendment to the IND and final protocol with clarifying information to the FDA by the end of the year. We currently anticipate that the FDA will complete its review of this amendment in Q1 2025 and we do not expect any further feedback or additional information requests that would delay start of the study. We currently plan to commence enrolling the DOSED study as soon as feasible after submitting these updates. 
 Our pipeline of allogeneic, or off-the-shelf , cell therapy programs currently includes: 
 RG6501 (OpRegen) , an allogeneic RPE cell replacement therapy currently in a Phase 2a multicenter, open-label, single arm clinical trial, being conducted by Roche, for the treatment of GA secondary to AMD, also known as atrophic or dry AMD. 

OPC1 , an allogeneic oligodendrocyte progenitor cell therapy which we plan to evaluate in the DOSED clinical study, to test the safety and utility of a novel spinal cord delivery device in both subacute and chronic spinal cord injuries and continues to be evaluated in long-term follow-up from a Phase 1/2a multicenter clinical trial for subacute cervical spinal cord injuries. 

ANP1 , an allogeneic auditory neuron progenitor cell transplant currently in preclinical development for the treatment of debilitating hearing loss. 

PNC1, an allogeneic photoreceptor cell transplant currently being developed for the treatment of vision loss due to photoreceptor dysfunction or damage. 

RND1 , a novel, hypoimmune iPSCs line being developed in collaboration with Factor Bioscience Limited, as assignee from Eterna Therapeutics, Inc., which will be evaluated for differentiation into cell transplant product candidates for central nervous system diseases and other neurology indications. 

Other Programs 
 We have additional undisclosed product candidates being considered for development, and we may consider others which cover a range of therapeutic areas and unmet medical needs. Generally, these product candidates are based on the same platform technology and employ a similar, guided cell differentiation and transplant approach as most of the product candidates described above, but in some cases may also include genetic modifications designed to enhance efficacy and/or safety profiles. 
 In addition to seeking to create value for shareholders by developing product candidates and advancing those candidates through clinical development, we also may seek to create value from our non-core intellectual property or related technologies and capabilities, through licensing collaborations and/or strategic transactions, such as our business development approach to our VAC dendritic cell therapy platform. 
 Israel-Hamas War 
 All of our manufacturing processes, including cell banking and product manufacturing for our cell therapy product candidates, are conducted by our subsidiary, Cell Cure, at its facility in Jerusalem, Israel, and more than two-thirds of our workforce are Cell Cure employees who are based in the same facility. As of the date of the filing of this report, our operations have not been materially or adversely impacted as a result of the Israel-Hamas war that began in October 2023 nor the broader regional conflict that has developed since. 
 As a result of safety concerns and in response to government-imposed restrictions on movement and travel and other precautions taken at the outset of the war, our operations at our facilities in Israel were temporarily impacted. Further, a number of the employees in Israel are members of the military reserves and subject to immediate call-up in response to the ongoing war in Israel. A number of the employees in Israel have been activated for military duty and additional employees may also be activated. In addition, the general impact on employees operating in a region at war could adversely impact our operations. Although we have business continuity plans in place to address medium- or long-term disruptions that could result from the war, any long-term closure of our facilities in Israel, or if those facilities were damaged, or if hostilities otherwise disrupt the ongoing operation of our facilities, or if a meaningful number of employees are unable to work for significant portions of time, our operations would be materially and adversely impacted. 
 It is currently not possible to predict the scope, duration or severity of the ongoing war or its effects on our operations, financial condition or operating results. The ongoing war is rapidly evolving, and could materially adversely impact our business and operations, including our ability to raise capital, as well as the overall economy in Israel and the value of the New Israeli Shekel. See the risk factor titled, All of our manufacturing operations currently are conducted at our facility in Jerusalem, Israel. Accordingly, political and economic conditions in Israel and war, terrorist attacks or other armed conflicts involving Israel, such as the Israel-Hamas war that began in October 2023 and broader regional conflict that has developed since, could directly affect our business. Any event or condition that significantly disrupts our ordinary course of operations at our Jerusalem facility could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results, in our 2023 10-K. 
 31 

Our commercial insurance may not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with war and terrorism. Although the Israeli government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure that this government coverage will be maintained or that it will sufficiently cover our potential damages. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 An accounting policy is deemed critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements. See Part II, Item 7 Critical Accounting Estimates and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8 of our 2023 10-K for accounting policies and related estimates we believe are the most critical to understanding our condensed consolidated interim financial statements, financial condition and results of operations and which require complex management judgment and assumptions or involve uncertainties. The estimates and judgments involved in our accounting policies as described in Part II, Item 8 on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, continue to be our critical accounting policies and there have been no other material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 2.5 million increase and 0.2 million decrease in total revenues, was primarily related to collaboration revenues recognized under the Roche Agreement, resulting from updates in total estimated costs to be incurred under this collaboration agreement. 
 Collaboration revenues may fluctuate from period to period based on changes in estimated costs to support performance obligations. The collaboration revenue was included within deferred revenue at the beginning of each reporting period. See Note 3 (Revenue) to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. 
 Operating expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of cost of sales, research and development expenses, and general and administrative expenses. 
 Cost of sales. These expenses consist of costs associated with royalty revenue which has resulted from product sales by our sublicensees. 
 Research and development expenses . These expenses consist of costs incurred for company-sponsored, collaborative and contracted research and development activities. These costs include direct expenses and indirect research-related overhead expenses including compensation and related benefits, stock-based compensation, consulting fees, research and laboratory fees, rent of research facilities, amortization of intangible assets, and license fees paid to third parties to acquire patents or licenses to use patents and other technology. Research and development expenses which have an alternative future use will be capitalized as intangible assets, and research and development costs with no future benefit or alternative use will be expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses incurred and reimbursed by grants from third parties approximate the grant income recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. Royalties and sublicensing fees are recorded as research and development expenses, unless they are associated with royalties from product sales, which we classify as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. We expect our total research and development expenses to fluctuate each reporting period based on several factors including (i) the stage of development for each cell therapy program, (ii) the availability of resources to work on each program, and (iii) the timing of contractual obligations. 
 32 

General and administrative expenses . These expenses consist of employee and director compensation and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, for executive and corporate personnel, professional and consulting fees, and allocated overhead such as facilities rent and equipment rent and maintenance, insurance costs allocated to general and administrative expenses, costs of patent applications, prosecution and maintenance, stock exchange-related costs, depreciation expense, marketing costs, legal and accounting costs, and other miscellaneous expenses.

Research and development expenses . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the 0.6 million quarter-over-quarter decrease in total research and development expenses was attributable to: (i) a 0.6 million decrease related to our OPC1 program; (ii) a 0.4 million net decrease for our preclinical programs; (iii) a 0.1 million decrease for our other research and development programs; and (iv) partially offset by a 0.5 million increase for our OpRegen program. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 2.8 million year-over-year decrease in total research and development expenses was attributable to: (i) a 1.6 million decrease related to our OPC1 program; (ii) a 1.0 million net decrease for our preclinical programs; (iii) a 0.4 million decrease for our other research and development programs; and (iv) partially offset by a 0.2 million increase for our OpRegen program.

General and administrative expenses . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the 0.4 million quarter-over-quarter increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to (i) a 0.3 million increase in personnel costs and (ii) 0.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 0.8 million year-over-year increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to: (i) a 0.4 million increase in personnel costs and (ii) 0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense.

Interest income. Interest income was lower for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by lower balances within our money market funds, Interest income was greater for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a nominal increase in interest rates within our marketable debt security holdings and our money market funds. 
 Marketable equity securities, net. We expect our net gain or loss on marketable equitable securities to fluctuate each reporting period based on the changes in the market price of the common stock held by us which could impact our net income or loss reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for a particular reporting period. These shares are carried at fair market value on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 4 (Marketable Securities) to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding our marketable equity securities. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Lineage recognized a net loss on marketable equity securities primarily related to changes in the fair market value of the securities during the respective periods. 
 Foreign currency transaction gain (loss), net . Foreign currency transaction gain (loss), net, for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of net foreign currency transaction gains and losses recognized by our subsidiaries Cell Cure and ES Cell International Pte. Ltd. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses for the periods presented are principally related to the remeasurement of the U.S. dollar denominated notes payable and notes receivable between Cell Cure and Lineage. 
 Other income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an employee retention credit of 0.5 million, and no comparable credit was recorded in 2024. The employee retention credit is a payroll tax refund per employee, under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act which was designed by the U.S. Treasury Department to assist businesses that retained employees during the COVID pandemic. The company qualified for this credit due to a decline in the quarterly revenue during 2020 and 2021 as compared to the same quarterly period in 2019. 
 Income Taxes 
 Under ASC 740, Income Taxes , a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We established a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2018 due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from the net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets, including foreign net operating losses generated by our subsidiaries. 
 Lineage recorded a 1.8 million deferred tax benefit due to the ability to offset certain deferred tax assets against the deferred tax liability associated with in-process research and development ("IPR D"), and the related release of the valuation allowance in the first quarter of 2023. It was determined that a portion of the deferred tax liability related to the indefinite lived assets may be realized prior to the expiration of certain pre 2018 net operating losses. Lineage did not record a deferred tax benefit for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, and did not record a deferred tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a loss from operations of 16.4 million and had negative cash flow from operations of 16.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit was 400.2 million. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. 
 34 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 32.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. In February 2024, we raised approximately 13.8 million in net proceeds through a registered direct offering of our common shares. We have historically funded our operations primarily through proceeds from the sale of our common shares and securities exercisable for or convertible into our common shares, the sale of common stock of our former subsidiaries, research grants, revenues from collaborations, and royalties from product sales that are unrelated to our current cell therapy product candidates. We do not expect sales of shares of our former subsidiaries that we own to be a significant source of additional funds. See Note 4 (Marketable Securities) to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding those marketable equity securities. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued and sold 55,830 common shares under our at-the-market offering program for gross proceeds of 70,000. As of September 30, 2024, 39.97 million remained available for sale under our at-the-market offering program. See Note 10 (Shareholders Equity) to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding our at-the-market offering program.

Cash used in operating activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 16.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily reflects the loss from operations of 16.4 million plus the changes in operating assets and liabilities of 5.7 million. These items were partially offset by the non-cash expenses of 3.8 million for stock-based compensation and 0.5 million for depreciation and amortization. The foreign currency remeasurement had no effect on cash flows. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 22.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which primarily reflects the loss from operations of 18.4 million plus the changes in operating assets and liabilities of 9.6 million. These items were offset by the non-cash expenses of 3.6 million for stock-based compensation and 0.6 million for depreciation and amortization. The foreign currency remeasurement and deferred tax benefit had no effect on cash flows. 
 Cash (used in) provided by investing activities 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.9 million and primarily resulted from the purchase of U.S. Treasury securities, net of proceeds from maturities of U.S. Treasury securities. 
 Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 36.7 million and consisted of 53.5 million in U.S. Treasury securities which matured during the period and 0.2 million in proceeds from the sale of marketable equity securities, partially offset by 16.4 million used to purchase U.S. Treasury securities and 0.6 million used to purchase equipment. 
 Cash provided by financing activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.1 million and primarily consisted of net proceeds from the sale of our common shares in our registered direct offering and from the sale of our common shares under our at-the-market offering program. 
 Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 6.4 million and primarily consisted of net proceeds from the sale of our common shares under our at-the-market offering program. 
 35 

Financial Obligations 
 Our financial obligations primarily consist of obligations to our licensors under license agreements, obligations related to grants received from government entities, including the IIA, obligations under vendor contracts for research services and other purchase commitments with suppliers. 
 Our obligations to licensors under license agreements and to government entities under the terms of grants we have received require us to make future payments relating to sublicense fees, milestone payments, redemption fees, royalties and patent maintenance costs. Sublicense fees are payable to licensors or government entities when we sublicense underlying intellectual property to third parties; the fees are based on a percentage of the license-related revenue we receive from sublicensees. Milestone payments are due to licensors or government entities upon future achievement of certain commercial, development and regulatory milestones, including those related to the Roche Agreement. Redemption fees due to the IIA under the Innovation Law are due upon receipt of any milestone payments and royalties received under the Roche Agreement, see Note 13 (Commitments and Contingencies) to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. Royalties are payable to licensors or government entities based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products, including those related to the Roche Agreement. Patent maintenance costs are payable to licensors as reimbursement for the cost of maintaining licensed patents. Due to the contingent nature of the payments, the amounts and timing of payments to licensors under our in-license agreements and to government entities under the terms of grants we have received are uncertain and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. As of September 30, 2024, we have not included these commitments on our consolidated balance sheet because the achievement and timing of these events are not fixed and determinable. 
 As discussed above, we have received grants under the Innovation Law and are required to pay royalties to the IIA from the revenues generated from the sale of product candidates and related services developed, in whole or in part pursuant to, or as a result of, a research and development program funded by the IIA. Under the Innovation Law, we are also required to pay redemption fees to the IIA. To date, through a series of separate grants beginning in 2007, Cell Cure has received a total of 15.4 million from the IIA to support the OpRegen program. We are obligated to pay approximately 24.1 of any future payments we may receive under the Roche Agreement to the IIA, up to an aggregate cap on all payments to IIA, such cap growing over time via interest accrual until paid in full. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate cap amount was approximately 94.8 million. Redemption fees due to the IIA under the Innovation Law are due upon receipt of any milestone payments and royalties received under the Roche Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we have not included any future financial obligations due to the IIA under the Innovation Law in our consolidated balance sheet because the achievement and timing of the events that would require future payments to the IIA under the Innovation Law is not fixed and determinable. See Note 13 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this report for additional information. 
 As of September 30, 2024, under the terms of the leases for the facilities from which Cell Cure and Lineage operate, a total of 2.9 million of rent payments will become due, of which 0.3 million will become due in the remainder of 2024. 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into services agreements with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and other third parties. Generally, these agreements provide for termination upon notice, with specified amounts due upon termination based on the timing of termination and the terms of the agreement. The amounts and timing of payments under these agreements are uncertain and contingent upon the initiation and completion of the services to be provided. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 We expect to continue to incur losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. As a result, we will need significant additional capital to fund our operations. Our determination as to when we will seek additional capital and the amount of additional capital that we will need will be based on our evaluation of the progress we make in our research and development programs, changes to the scope and focus of those programs, changes in grant funding for certain of those programs, and projection of future costs, revenues, and rates of expenditure. If we are unable to raise additional capital when and as needed, we may be required to delay, postpone, or cancel our clinical trials or limit the number of clinical trial sites. 
 We may seek to obtain the additional capital we may need through one or more equity offerings, debt financings, government or other grant funding, or other third-party funding transactions, including potential strategic alliances and licensing or collaboration agreements, or structured financings such as royalty monetization transactions. We cannot provide any assurance that adequate additional capital will be available on favorable terms, if at all. The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common shares to decline, and the issuance of additional equity securities could result in the dilution of the interests of our current shareholders. If we obtain additional capital through strategic alliances and licensing or collaboration agreements or structured financing, we may be required to relinquish rights to our intellectual property, our product candidates or rights to future revenue streams or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us. The unavailability or inadequacy 
 36 

of additional capital to meet future capital needs could force us to modify, curtail, delay, or suspend some or all aspects of our current planned operations. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted due to external factors beyond our control, such as unfavorable global economic conditions, disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide, public health emergencies, geopolitical conflicts, political and economic instability, inflation and relatively high interest rates, and other macroeconomic factors. 
 We believe that our 32.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through at least twelve months from the issuance date of our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We believe we will meet our longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations with our current cash and cash equivalents, milestone and other payments we expect to receive under our collaboration agreements, and proceeds we receive from sales of our common shares under our at-the-market offering program.

Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Under SEC rules and regulations, as a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

PAR T II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. From time-to-time we may be involved in a variety of legal proceedings. Such proceedings may initially be viewed as immaterial but could later prove to be material. Legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. Given the inherent uncertainties in litigation, even when we can reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and reasonably estimable loss contingencies, the actual outcome may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach. In addition, legal proceedings could involve significant expense and diversion of management s attention and resources from other matters. For a discussion of legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 13 (Commitments and Contingencies) in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
 It em 1A. Risk Factors 
 An investment in our common shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described in the 2023 10-K, in addition to other information in this report, when evaluating our business and before deciding whether to purchase, hold or sell our common shares. Each of these risks and uncertainties, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects, as well as adversely affect the market price of our common shares, in which case you may lose all or part of your investment. There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 10-K.
