, that was to expire on June 15, 2026. 

On
February 29, 2024, we replaced the asset backed line of credit agreement with a Senior Secured Revolving Line of Credit with
Bank of America (the Revolver ). The Revolver allows for borrowings at a defined base rate, or at the one, three or six
month Secured Overnight Finance Rate, also known as SOFR, plus a defined margin. If the Company prepays SOFR borrowings
before their contractual maturity, the Company has agreed to compensate the bank for lost margin, as defined in the Revolver agreement.
The Company is required to quarterly pay a 20-basis point fee on the unused portion of the Revolver. 

The
Revolver requires the Company to maintain no more than 2.5 times leverage ratio and at least a 1.25 times minimum fixed charges coverage
ratio, both of which are defined in the Revolver agreement. The Company met the covenants for the period ended September 30, 2024. There
are no subjective acceleration clauses under the Revolver that would accelerate the maturity of outstanding borrowings. The Revolver
contains certain covenants which, among other things, require the Company to adhere to regular reporting requirements, abide by shareholder
dividend limitations, maintain certain financial performance, and limit the amount of annual capital expenditures. The Revolver is secured
by substantially all the Company s assets and expires on February 28, 2027. We were in compliance with all the financial covenants
related to this agreement as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024, except for the covenant related to operating expense contributions
to our Mexican operations in the first and second quarters of 2024 in excess of the amounts allowed under the Revolver. We received
a waiver of this event of default from the bank in August 2024. 

Under
the amended Bank of America credit agreement signed February 29, 2024, the line of credit is subject to variations in the SOFR index
rate. Under the prior credit agreement with Bank of America, the line of credit borrowing availability was restricted by a defined asset
borrowing base, and interest was based on variations in the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield (BSBY) index rate. Our line of credit bears
interest at a weighted-average interest rate of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We had borrowings
on our line of credit of and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September
30, 2024 we had unused availability on the line of credit of . 

The
Company has an interim funding agreement as of September 30, 2024 with a bank related to 
 of deposits made on equipment purchases that
will be funded through a finance lease when the equipment is received and operational. As of September 30, we have 
 outstanding on the interim funding agreement
for equipment we expect to receive in the fourth quarter of 2024.

or more. Right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present
value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term which includes renewal periods we are reasonably certain to exercise. Our
leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. We amended our operating leases for
part of our manufacturing facility in China and our corporate office in Maple Grove, Minnesota during the first nine months of 2024
which extended the lease through August of 2033 with monthly lease payments of 
to . As of September 30, 2024, we have a lease commitment of approximately for a finance lease that will commence

United States of America BIRD Foundation ). The parties were successful in receiving approval for a conditional
grant. The Company and Marpe Technologies will each receive from the BIRD Foundation and, among other obligations under the grant,
each is required to contribute to match grant funds from the BIRD Foundation. The Company has met its obligation by providing certain
services at cost or with respect to administrative services at no cost to Marpe Technologies. The total value of the Company s

services beyond its contribution. The Company will receive a -year exclusive right to manufacture the products of Marpe Technologies.
There can be no assurances that Marpe Technologies medical device operations will be commercially successful, that Marpe Technologies
will be successful in raising additional funds to finance its operations or, if commercially successful, the Company will recover the
value of services provided to Marpe if not paid when the services are provided. The transactions between the Company and Marpe Technologies
have been approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to the Company Related-Party Transactions Policy. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized net sales to Marpe Technologies of and

with Marpe are on terms comparable to those that the Company could reasonably expect in an arm s length transaction with an unrelated
third party.

Net
Sales. Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 31,407 and 33,369, respectively, a decrease of 1,962
or 5.9 . Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 99,513 and 103,278, respectively, a decrease of 3,765
or 3.6 . The following is a summary of net sales by our major industry markets:

Medical:
 Net sales to our medical customers increased 212, or 1.2 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same
 period in 2023, and decreased 5,823, or 9.7 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023.
 The decrease in the nine-month comparison was primarily due to inventory re-balancing with existing customers, timing of customer
 product launches and lower average sales prices in anticipation of moving several programs for one customer to our Monterrey, Mexico
 facility which will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

Industrial:
 Net sales to our industrial customers decreased 2,001, or 19.2 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the
 same period in 2023, and 1,323, or 4.6 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023. The
 decrease in net sales was primarily due to industrial customer s efforts to reduce their inventory investments, delayed program launches with several customers as well as sales
 headwinds in several markets for which we provide products for these customers. 

Aerospace
 and defense: Net sales to our aerospace and defense customers decreased 173, or 3.4 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024,
 as compared with the same period in 2023, and increased 3,381, or 23.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
 with the same period in 2023. The increase in net sales in the nine-month comparison relates to increasing demand in the aerospace
 and defense market, and improved supply chain availability of component materials. 

Backlog.
 Our 90-day shipment backlog as of September 30, 2024 was 29,631, down 1.5 from June 30, 2024, and 12.3 from the prior-year comparable
quarter end. Our 90-day backlog consists of firm purchase orders we expect to ship in the next 90 days, with any remaining amounts to
be shipped within 180 days. 

Our
total order backlog as of September 30, 2024 was 69,770, a 4.8 decrease from the prior quarter end and a 31.8 decrease from the prior-year
comparable quarter end. As the supply chain lead times have normalized, customers are returning to their pre-pandemic ordering practices,
which has resulted in a decrease in our backlog. We continue to experience reduced visibility to revenues in the next several quarters
as customers are rebalancing their inventories and, therefore, deferring the placement of some orders. 

90-day
and total shipment backlog by our major industry markets are as follows:

Gross
profit and gross margins. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 12.2 and 15.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 14.0 and 15.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2024 as compared with the same prior-year periods was the
result of lower net sales, as discussed above, and corresponding lower operating leverage from reduced production at a number of our manufacturing facilities. 

18 

Selling
expenses. Selling expenses were decreased slightly in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as the result of
lower incentive compensation accruals in the current-year periods. 

General
and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased slightly in the 2024 periods as compared with the 2023
periods as the result of lower incentive compensation accruals in the current-year periods. 

Restructuring
charges . Restructuring charges were 176 and 267 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, for accrued
employee retention bonuses for our facility consolidation and closure of our Blue Earth facility. We expect to incur approximately 800
of cash restructuring costs, including employee retention and facility moving cost in 2024, of which substantially all are expected to
be incurred and paid by December 2024. 

Operating
income. Operating (loss) income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were (467) or (1.5) of net sales, and 1,124
or 3.4 of net sales, respectively. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1,032 or 1.0 of net
sales and 3,276 or 3.2 of net sales, respectively. Decreases in both periods were driven by the decrease in net sales and resulting
gross margin. 

Other
expense 

Interest
expense. Interest expense was 216 and 130 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense
was 548 and 365 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was driven by higher borrowings
under our line of credit arrangement. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion of financing arrangements. 

Income
taxes. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8 and 62 , respectively. Our effective
tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was (21 and 13 , respectively. The primary drivers of the change in
rate relate to changes in pretax book income and the 2023 U.S. federal provision to return adjustments recorded in the third quarter
of 2024, partially offset by realization of deferred tax assets in the 2024 periods as the Company removed its valuation allowance in
the fourth quarter of 2023.

Operating
Activities. Cash used in operating activities was 3,043 in the first nine months of 2024, compared with cash provided of 2,181
in the same prior-year period. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities affecting cash flows during these periods included: 

Cash
 provided by accounts receivable and contract assets was 2,150 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with cash
 usage of 1,942 in the same prior-year period. The improved cash flow in the current year was due to the timing of customer payments
 in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared with the fourth quarter of 2022, both of which impacted cash collections in the subsequent
 year. 

Cash
 used in inventory was 922 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with cash provided of 899 in the prior-year period.
 The increase in the current-year period cash usage was the result of normal timing variances of inventory purchases and timing of
 product shipments and increased inventory levels to support the transition of manufacturing from our Blue Earth facility to our Bemidji
 plant. 

Cash
 used by changes in accounts payable was 3,609 in the current-year period as compared with cash use of 1,636 in the same prior-year
 period, primarily related to the timing of cash payments. 

Cash
 provided by customer deposits was 1,195 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with cash provided of 345 in the
 same prior-year period which is driven by timing of customer deposits received before the quarter end. 

19 

Investing
Activities. Cash used in investing activities was 971 in the first nine months of 2024, compared with cash used of 1,121 in the
same prior-year period, both primarily for capital expenditures. 

Financing
Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was 3,561in the first nine months of 2024, compared with cash used of 2,388 in
the same prior-year period. The increase in cash provided by financing activities resulted from the cash used for working capital in
the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
believe that our existing financing arrangements, anticipated cash flows from operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to satisfy
our working capital needs for the next twelve months, capital expenditures and debt repayments. 

Credit
Facility. We had a credit agreement with Bank of America, which was entered into on June 15, 2017 and provided for a line of credit
arrangement of 16,000, that was to expire on June 15, 2026. 

On
February 29, 2024, we replaced the asset backed line of credit agreement with a 15,000 Senior Secured Revolving Line of Credit with
Bank of America (the Revolver ). The Revolver allows for borrowings at a defined base rate, or at the one, three or six
month Secured Overnight Finance Rate, also known as SOFR, plus a defined margin. If the Company prepays SOFR borrowings
before their contractual maturity, the Company has agreed to compensate the bank for lost margin, as defined in the Revolver agreement.
The Company is required to quarterly pay a 20-basis point fee on the unused portion of the Revolver. 

The
Revolver requires the Company to maintain no more than 2.5 times leverage ratio and at least a 1.25 times minimum fixed charges coverage
ratio, both of which are defined in the Revolver agreement. The Company met the covenants for the period ended September 30, 2024. There
are no subjective acceleration clauses under the Revolver that would accelerate the maturity of outstanding borrowings. The Revolver
contains certain covenants which, among other things, require the Company to adhere to regular reporting requirements, abide by shareholder
dividend limitations, maintain certain financial performance, and limit the amount of annual capital expenditures. The Revolver is secured
by substantially all the Company s assets and expires on February 28, 2027. We were in compliance with all the financial covenants
related to this agreement as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024, except for the covenant related to operating expense contributions
to our Mexican operations in the first and second quarters of 2024 in excess of the amounts allowed under the Revolver. We received
a waiver of this event of default from the bank in August 2024. 

Under
the amended Bank of America credit agreement signed February 29, 2024, the line of credit is subject to variations in the SOFR index
rate. Under the prior credit agreement with Bank of America, the line of credit borrowing availability was restricted by a defined asset
borrowing base, and interest was based on variations in the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield (BSBY) index rate. Our line of credit bears
interest at a weighted-average interest rate of 7.9 and 8.3 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We had borrowings
on our line of credit of 9,550 and 5,846 outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September
30, 2024 we had unused availability on the line of credit of 5,450. 

The Company has an interim funding agreement as of
September 30, 2024 with a bank related to 317 of deposits made on equipment purchases that will be funded through a finance lease when
the equipment is received and operational. As of September 30, we have 317 outstanding on the interim funding agreement for equipment
we expect to receive in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

The line of credit is shown net of debt issuance costs of 42 and 31 on the condensed consolidated balance sheet
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have not engaged in any off-balance sheet activities as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.
