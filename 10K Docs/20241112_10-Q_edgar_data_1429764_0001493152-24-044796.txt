 During the three and nine months ended September

the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of shares of common stock under an at-the-market 
equity offering program for aggregate gross proceeds of , less issuance costs of . See Note 5 Stockholders 
Equity. 

The
Company has not yet achieved profitability and expects to continue to incur cash outflows from operations. Historically, the Company
has been able to raise funds to support its business operations, although there can be no assurance that it will be successful in raising
significant additional funds in the future. The Company expects that its cash on hand will fund its operations for at least 12 months
after the issuance date of these financial statements. 

Since
inception, the Company s operations have primarily been funded through proceeds received in equity and debt financing. The Company
believes it has access to capital resources and continues to evaluate additional financing opportunities. There is no assurance that
the Company will be able to obtain funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds
the Company might raise will enable the Company to complete its development initiatives or attain profitable operations. 

The
Company s operating needs include the planned costs to operate its business, including amounts required to fund working capital
and capital expenditures. The Company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many
factors, including the Company s ability to successfully commercialize its products and services, competing technological and market
developments, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or
complement its product and service offerings. The Company is executing its plan designed to improve the Company s liquidity by
enhancing revenue economics, increasing gross profit through product optimization, integration of acquisitions, and reduction of operating
expenses through cost avoidance and cost cutting strategies. There can be no assurances that these strategies will be achieved.

space in Miami Beach, Florida for approximately

Underperforming
Subsidiary 

During
the first quarter of 2024, the Company s Board of Directors approved a plan for the sale of underperforming assets of a subsidiary.
On April 30, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell installed and inventory charging units and the associated agreements
with existing customers, hosts, and drivers. This transaction was completed and funded on July 3, 2024. As a result, the Company recorded
a loss of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which is included in operating expenses
on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company elected not to present this underperforming subsidiary
as discontinued operations because it is not material to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.

The
timing of the Company s revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by its customers. A receivable is recorded when
revenue is recognized prior to payment and the Company has an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the
provision of the related services, the Company records deferred revenue until the performance obligations are satisfied. 

As

REVENUE
RECOGNITION CONTINUED 

Grants,
rebates and alternative fuel credits, which are not within the scope of ASC 606, pertaining to revenues and periodic expenses are recognized
as income when the related revenue and/or periodic expense are recorded. Grants and rebates related to EV charging stations and their
installation are deferred and amortized in a manner consistent with the related depreciation expense of the related asset over their
useful lives over the useful life of the charging station. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized
 
 and

fuel credits. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized 
 and ,
respectively, of revenue related to alternative fuel credits. 

Car-sharing
services is accounted for under ASC Topic 842, Leases, and pertains to revenues and expenses related to a car-sharing services agreement
with the City of Los Angeles which allows customers the ability to rent electric vehicles through a subscription service. The Company
accounts for such rentals as operating leases. The lease terms are included in the Company s contracts, and the determination of
whether the Company s contracts contain leases generally does not require significant assumptions or judgments. The Company s
lease revenues do not include material amounts of variable payments. The Company does not provide an option for the lessee to purchase
the rented equipment at the end of the lease. 

The
Company is unsure of when the customer will return rented equipment. As such, the Company does not know how much the customer will owe
it upon return of the equipment and, therefore, cannot provide a maturity analysis of future lease payments. The Company s equipment
is generally rented for short periods of time (generally a few minutes to a few hours). Lessees do not provide residual value guarantees
on rented equipment. 

The
Company expects to derive significant future benefits from its equipment following the end of the rental term. The Company s equipment
is typically rented for the majority of the time that the Company owns it. The Company recognizes revenue over the contractual period
of performance of the subscription which are short term in nature.

during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The
Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations. 

The
fair value measurements used in the evaluation described above are considered to be Level 3 valuations within the fair value hierarchy,
as the measurements involve projections of discounted future cash flows, which are derived from unobservable assumptions, the most subjective
of which are the discount rates for each respective reporting unit. The discount rate used in for all reporting units ranged from 
to during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The discount rate used for all reporting units ranged from 
to during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Based
on its analysis, the Company determined that the Legacy Blink reporting unit s carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value
as of September 30, 2024. Consequently, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 69,111 during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

As
a result of the impairment analysis it was determined that the Mobility reporting unit qualifies as at risk for impairment.
The Company quantitatively defines at risk as a percentage of the excess of the reporting unit s fair value over

LITIGATION,
DISPUTES AND SETTLEMENTS 

The
Company may be subject to lawsuits, investigations, intellectual property matters, claims and proceedings, including, but not limited
to, contractual disputes with vendors and customers and liabilities related to employment, health and safety matters that may arise in
the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Loss contingencies are
subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex
and subject to change. 

The
Company believes it has recorded adequate provisions for any such lawsuits, investigations, claims, and proceedings as of September 30,
2024, and the Company believes it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized
in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Given the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the ultimate outcome of the ongoing
matters described herein cannot be predicted with certainty. While litigation is inherently unpredictable, the Company believes it has
valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it. However, future events or circumstances, currently unknown to management,
may potentially have a material effect on the Company s financial position, liquidity or results of operations in any future reporting
period. 

In
August 2020, a purported securities class action lawsuit, captioned Bush v. Blink Charging Co. et al., Case No. 20-cv-23527, was filed
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the Company, Michael Farkas (Blink s former Chairman
of the Board and Chief Executive Officer), and Michael Rama (Blink s Chief Financial Officer) (the Bush Lawsuit ).
In September 2020, another purported securities class action lawsuit, captioned Vittoria v. Blink Charging Co. et al., Case No. 20-cv-23643,
was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the same defendants and seeking to recover
the same alleged damages. Following consolidation of the two actions and the court appointing Tianyou Wu, Alexander Yu and H. Marc Joseph
to serve as the Co-Lead Plaintiffs, the Co-Lead Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint in February 2021. The Amended Complaint alleged,
among other things, that the defendants made false or misleading statements about the size and functionality of the Blink Network and
asserted claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In April 2021, Blink and the other defendants
filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint. In November 2023, the court dismissed Co-Lead Plaintiffs claims relating to the
size of Blink s charging network and denied the remainder of the motion to dismiss. Following a mediation in April 2024, the parties
agreed to the terms of a settlement in which the Defendants agreed to pay 3,750 (inclusive of attorneys fees and administrative
costs) in exchange for the dismissal with prejudice of all claims. On October 21, 2024, the Court held a final settlement hearing, approved
the settlement, dismissed the Bush Lawsuit with prejudice, and closed the case. The full settlement amount has been paid by
the Company s Directors and Officers insurance policies. 

In
September 2020, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, captioned Klein (derivatively on behalf of Blink Charging Co.) v. Farkas et al., Case
No. 20- 19815CA01, was filed in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court seeking to pursue claims belonging to the Company against Blink s
Board of Directors and Michael Rama (the Klein Lawsuit ). Blink is named as a nominal defendant. The Klein Lawsuit asserted
that the Director defendants caused Blink to make the statements at issue in the securities class action and, as a result, the Company
incurred costs defending against the Bush Lawsuit and other unidentified investigations. The Klein Lawsuit asserted claims against the
Director defendants for breach of fiduciary duties and corporate waste and against all of the defendants for unjust enrichment. Klein
did not quantify the alleged damages in his complaint, but he sought damages sustained by the Company as a result of the defendants 
alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, corporate governance changes, restitution, and disgorgement of profits from the defendants and
attorneys fees and other litigation expenses. In December 2020, another shareholder derivative action, captioned Bhatia (derivatively
on behalf of Blink Charging Co.) v. Farkas et al., Case No. 20-27632CA01, was filed in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court against the same
defendants in the Klein Lawsuit and asserted similar claims, as well as additional claims relating to the Company s nomination,
appointment and hiring of minorities and women and the Company s decision to retain its outside auditor (the Bhatia Lawsuit ).
In June 2022, the court consolidated the Klein and Bhatia actions under the caption In re Blink Charging Company Stockholder Derivative
Litigation, Lead Case No. 2020-019815-CA-01. The action remains stayed. The Company wholly and completely disputes the allegations. The
Company has retained legal counsel to defend the action vigorously. The Company has not recorded an accrual related to this matter as
of September 30, 2024, as it determined that any such loss contingency was either not probable or estimable. 

In
February 2022, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, captioned McCauley (derivatively on behalf of Blink Charging Co.) v. Farkas et al.,
Case No. A-22-847894-C, was filed in Clark County, Nevada seeking to pursue claims belonging to the Company against Blink s Board
of Directors and Michael Rama (the McCauley Lawsuit ). Blink is named as a nominal defendant. The McCauley Lawsuit asserted
similar claims and sought similar damages as the Klein Lawsuit. The action remains stayed. The Company wholly and completely disputes
the allegations. The Company has retained legal counsel to defend the action vigorously. The Company has not recorded an accrual related
to this matter as of September 30, 2024, as it determined that any such loss contingency was either not probable or estimable.

Overview 

We
are a leading manufacturer, owner, operator and provider of electric vehicle EV charging equipment and networked EV charging
services in the continuously growing U.S. and international markets for EVs. Blink offers residential and commercial EV charging equipment
and services, enabling EV drivers to recharge at various location types. Blink s principal line of products and services is its
Blink EV charging network (the Blink Networks and Blink EV charging equipment, also known as electric vehicle supply equipment EVSE and other EV-related services. The Blink Networks is a proprietary, cloud-based system that operates, maintains,
and manages Blink charging stations and handles the associated charging data, back-end operations, and payment processing. The Blink
Networks provide property owners, managers, parking companies, state and municipal entities, and other types of commercial customers, Property Partners with cloud-based services that enable the remote monitoring and management of EV charging stations.
The Blink Networks also provide EV drivers with vital station information, including station location, availability and fees. 

To
capture more revenues derived from providing EV charging equipment to commercial customers and to help differentiate Blink in the EV
infrastructure market, Blink offers Property Partners a comprehensive range of solutions for EV charging equipment and services that
generally fall into one of the business models below, differentiated by who own the equipment and who bears the costs of installation,
equipment, and maintenance, and the percentage of revenue shared. 

In
 our Blink-owned turnkey business model, we incur the charging equipment and installation costs. We own and operate the EV
 charging station and provide connectivity of the charging station to the Blink Networks. In this model, which favors recurring revenues,
 we incur most costs associated with the EV charging stations; thus, we retain substantially all EV charging revenues after deducting
 network connectivity and processing fees. Our agreement with the Property Partner typically lasts seven years with extensions that
 can bring the term to 21 years. 

In
 our Blink-owned hybrid business model, we incur the charging equipment costs while the Property Partner incurs the installation
 costs. We own and operate the EV charging station and provide connectivity to the Blink Networks. In this model, since the Property
 Partner incurs the installation, we share a more generous portion of the EV charging revenues with the Property Partner after deducting
 Blink Network connectivity and processing fees. Our agreement with the Property Partner lasts five years with extensions that can
 bring the term to 15 years. 

In
 our host-owned business model, the Property Partner purchases, owns and operates the Blink EV charging station and incurs
 the installation costs. We work with the Property Partner by providing site recommendations, connectivity to the Blink Networks,
 payment processing, and optional maintenance services. In this model, the Property Partner retains and keeps all the EV charging
 revenues after deducting Blink Network connectivity and processing fees. 

In
 our Blink-as-a-Service model, we own and operate the EV charging station, while the Property Partner incurs the installation
 costs. The Property Partner pays us a fixed monthly fee for the service and keeps all the EV charging revenues after deducting Blink
 network connectivity and processing fees. Typically, our agreement with the Property owner typically lasts five years. 

We
also own and operate an EV car-sharing program through our wholly owned subsidiary, Envoy Mobility, Inc. This program allows customers
to share electric vehicles through subscription services and charge those cars through our charging stations. 

In
pursuit of our commitment to fostering the widespread adoption of EVs through the establishment and management of EV charging infrastructure
on a global scale, we remain steadfast in our dedication to mitigating climate change. This dedication is evidenced by our efforts to
diminish greenhouse gas emissions stemming from gasoline-powered vehicles With the goal of being a leader in the build-out of EV charging
infrastructure and maximizing our share of the EV charging market, we have established strategic commercial, municipal, and retail partnerships
across industry verticals and encompassing numerous transit/destination locations, including airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical,
hotels, mixed-use, municipal sites, multifamily residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions,
restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations.

(collectively, the Agents to conduct an at-the-market ATM equity offering program, pursuant to which we
may publicly issue and sell from time to time shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 250,000 through
the Agents. We are using the net proceeds from the sale of our shares of common stock under the ATM equity offering program to supplement
our operating cash flows in order to fund our EV charging station deployments and other growth plans. We are also using a portion of
the net proceeds we receive for working capital and other corporate purposes. The amounts and timing of our use of the net proceeds will
depend on a number of factors, such as the timing and progress of our EV charging station deployment efforts, the timing and progress
of any partnering and collaboration efforts, and technological advances. Under the Sales Agreement, the Agents are entitled to an aggregate
fixed commission of up to 3 of the gross proceeds from shares sold and we have provided the Agents with customary indemnification rights. 

On
November 16, 2023, we entered into an Amendment to the Sales Agreement, effective as of November 2, 2023 (the Amendment ),
with the Agents. The Amendment revised the term Registration Statement, as used in the Sales Agreement, to our new shelf
registration statement on Form S-3, as amended (File No. 333-275123), and revised the term Prospectus Supplement, as used

believe our performance and future success depend on several factors, including those discussed below: 

Competition
 - The EV charging equipment and service market is highly competitive, and we expect the market to become increasingly competitive
as new entrants enter this growing market. Our products and services compete on product performance and features, the total cost of ownership,
origin of manufacturing, sales capabilities, financial stability, brand recognition, product reliability, and the installed base s
size. Existing competitors may expand their product offerings and sales strategies, and new competitors may enter the market. If our
market share decreases due to increased competition, its revenue and ability to generate profits in the future may be negatively impacted. 

Growth
 - Our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of EVs, and we are subject to a risk of any reduced demand for EVs.
The market for alternative fuel vehicles is still relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price
competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements, long
development cycles for EV original equipment manufacturers, and changing consumer demands and behaviors. Factors that may influence the
purchase and use of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically EVs, include perceptions about EV quality, safety (in particular with
respect to battery chemistries), design, performance and cost; the limited range over which EVs may be driven on a single battery charge
and concerns about running out of power while in use; improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine; consumers 
desire and ability to purchase a luxury automobile or one that is perceived as exclusive; the environmental consciousness of consumers;
volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline; consumers perceptions of the dependency of the United States on oil from unstable
or hostile countries and the impact of international conflicts; government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency
and alternate forms of energy; access to charging stations, standardization of EV charging systems and consumers perceptions about
convenience and cost to charge an EV; and the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate EVs or future
regulation requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles. If the market for EVs does not gain broad market acceptance or develops
slower than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. 

Regulations
- Our business is subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, including those with respect to
government incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy, electric vehicles and others. These laws and regulations,
and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. Any reduction, elimination or discriminatory application
of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in diminished
revenues from government sources and diminished demand for our products. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting our business
could be enacted. These laws and regulations are frequently costly to comply with and may divert a significant portion of management s
attention. Changes to these applicable laws or regulations could affect business and/or harm our customers, adversely affecting our business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

Expansion
through Acquisitions - We may pursue strategic domestic and international acquisitions to expand our operations. Risks in acquisition
transactions include difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses into our operations and control environment, difficulties
in assimilating and retaining employees and intermediaries, difficulties in retaining the existing clients of the acquired entities,
assumed or unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with the acquired businesses, the failure of counterparties to satisfy any
obligations to indemnify us against liabilities arising from the acquired businesses, and unfavorable market conditions that could negatively
impact our growth expectations for the acquired businesses. Fully integrating an acquired company or business into our operations may
take a significant amount of time. If we are unable to integrate or pursue strategic acquisitions, our financial condition and results
of operations would be negatively impacted.

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared With Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

Total
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 18,190 , or 42 , to 25,187 compared to 43,377 during the three months
ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenue
from product sales was 13,448 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 35,059 during the three months ended September
30, 2023, a decrease of 21,611, or 62 . This decrease was attributable to decreased sales of commercial chargers, DC fast chargers and
residential chargers when compared to the same period in 2023. 

Charging
service revenue from Company-owned charging stations was 5,254 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3,859 for
the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1,395, or 36 . The increase is due to the increase in utilization of chargers
and an increased number of chargers on the Blink Networks. 

Network
fee revenues were 2,332 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1,973 for the three months ended September 30,
2023, an increase of 359, or 18 . The increase was attributable to increases in host owned units during the three months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Warranty
revenues were 1,405 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 849 for the three months ended September 30, 2023,
an increase of 556 , or 65 . The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in warranty contracts sold for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we recorded a liability
of 3,112 which represents the estimated cost of existing backlog of known warranty cases. 

Grant
and rebate revenues were 982 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 47 during the three months ended September
30, 2023, an increase of 935, or 1,989 . Grant and rebates relating to equipment and the related installation are deferred and amortized
in a manner consistent with the depreciation expense of the related assets over their useful lives. The decrease in revenue was primarily
related to the timing of the amortization of previous years state grants/rebates associated with the installation of chargers
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Car-sharing
services revenues were 1,168 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 903 during the three months ended September
30, 2023, an increase of 265, or 29 . The increase in revenues is due to the increase in properties and participants subscribing to
the car-sharing services. 

Other
revenue decreased by 89 or 13 to 598 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 687 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits generated during the three
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. We generate these credits from the electricity utilized by our electric
car charging stations as a byproduct from our charging services in the states of California and Oregon. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues primarily consists of electricity reimbursements, revenue share payments to our Property Partner hosts, the cost of charging
stations sold, connectivity charges provided by telco and other networks, warranty, repairs and maintenance services, and depreciation
of our installed charging stations. Cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 16,068 as compared to 30,592
for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 14,524 or 47 . There is a degree of variability in our costs in relationship
to our revenues from period to period, primarily due to: 

electricity
 reimbursements that are unique to those Property Partner host agreements which provide for such reimbursements; 

revenue
 share payments are predicated on the contractual obligation under the property partner agreement and the revenue generated by the
 applicable chargers; 

cost
 of charging stations sold is predicated on the mix of types of charging stations and parts sold during the period; 

network
 costs are fixed in nature based on the number of chargers connected to the telco network regardless of whether the charger generates
 revenue; 

provisions
 for excess and obsolete inventory; and 

warranty
 and repairs and maintenance expenses are based on both the number of service cases completed during the period. 

Cost
of product sales decreased by 15,497, or 63 , from 24,619 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to 9,122 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction of the volume
of product sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 

Cost
of charging services-company-owned charging stations (electricity reimbursements) increased by 158, or 28 , to 724 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 566 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in 2024 was attributable to
the mix of charging stations generating charging service revenues subject to electricity reimbursement. 

Host
provider fees increased by 583, or 24 , to 2,982 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2,399 during the
three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was a result of the mix of chargers generating revenue and their corresponding revenue
share percentage payments to Property Partner hosts pursuant to their agreements. 

Network
costs increased by 170 or 42 , to 577 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 407 during the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase was a result of the increase in charging stations on our network and costs incurred related to
the upgrading of our network system compared to the same period in 2023. 

Warranty
and repairs and maintenance costs decreased by 267 or 48 ,
to 294 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 561 during the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in 2024 was attributable to significant efforts expended to reduce the backlog in warranty and
repairs and maintenance cases in the prior year. 

Cost
of car-sharing services was 1,156 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 931 during the 2023 period. The increase
was due to a reduction in costs related to vehicles used in this operation during the period. 

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased by 104, or 9 , to 1,213 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1,109 for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in depreciation expense was attributable to an increase in the number of EV charging
stations and vehicles associated with the ride-share services. 

Operating
Expenses 

Compensation expense decreased by 109 ,
or 1 , to 15,159 (consisting of approximately
 14 ,300 of cash compensation and benefits and approximately 900 
of non-cash compensation) for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Compensation expense was 15,268 (consisting of approximately
 14,100 of cash compensation and benefits and approximately 1,100 of non-cash compensation) for the three months ended September 30,
2023. The decrease in compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to decreases in personnel and compensation in executive, marketing, sales and operations
departments as a result of cost savings and synergies realized. The decrease in compensation expense was partially offset by severance
expense of 0.6 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 associated with the cost reduction plans we initiated
during this period. 

21 

General
and administrative expenses decreased by 567, or 7 , to 7,972 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 8,539 for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in legal, marketing, recruiting, software
licensing, investor/public relations and external consulting/other professional service expenditures of 1,827 partially offset by increases
in accounting/auditing and bad debt expenses of 735. 

Other
operating expenses decreased by 561, or 11 , to 4,739 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5,300 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in website, rent, vehicle, travel, annual meeting, hardware
and software development costs of 1,981. The decrease was primarily offset by increases in software licensing expenses, property/use
tax expenditures and insurance expense of 963. 

The
Company recorded a loss on change in fair value of consideration payable related to the Envoy acquisition of 364 in the 2024 period
due to the change in the inputs to the probability-weighted discounted cash flow model. There was no such amount recognized in the 2023
period. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we observed certain triggering events, including a decline in our stock price and, as a result,
we conducted a quantitative impairment analysis of our goodwill and intangible assets and determined that the fair value of certain reporting
units were less than the carrying amount and, as a result, recorded an impairment charge of 69,111 related to goodwill during the 2024
period. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we observed certain triggering events, including a decline in our stock price
and, as a result, we conducted a quantitative impairment analysis of our goodwill and intangible assets and determined that the fair
value of our reporting units were less than the carrying amount and, as a result, recorded an impairment charge of 89,087 related to
goodwill and 5,143 related to intangible assets during the 2023 period. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

We
recorded other income of 819 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to other expense of (1,362) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other income was primarily due to an increase
of 63 related to dividend and interest income, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 968 compared to the 2023 period
and a decrease in loss on extinguishment on notes payable. 

Net
Loss 

Our
net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 25,332, or 22 , to 87,389 as compared to 112,721 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by an
increase in gross profit.

nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was a result of the mix of chargers generating revenue and their corresponding revenue
share percentage payments to Property Partner hosts pursuant to their agreements. 

Network
costs increased by 477 or 36 , to 1,816
 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1,339 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase
was a result of the increase in charging stations on our network and costs incurred related to the upgrading of our network system compared
to the same period in 2023. 

Warranty
and repairs and maintenance costs decreased by 1,044 , or 36 ,
to 1,880 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2,924 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in 2024 was attributable to significant efforts expended to reduce the backlog in warranty and
repairs and maintenance cases in the prior year. 

Cost
of car-sharing services was 3,302 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to 3,162 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a reduction in costs related to vehicles used in this operation during the
period. 

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased by 1,720 , or 60 ,
to 4,573 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2,853 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in depreciation expense was attributable to an increase in the number of EV charging stations
and vehicles associated with the ride-share services. 

Operating
Expenses 

Compensation expense decreased by 28,197, or 37 , to 47,770 (consisting
of approximately 44,900 of cash compensation and benefits and approximately 2,900 of non-cash compensation) for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. Compensation expense was 75,967 (consisting of approximately 55,400 of cash compensation and benefits and approximately
 20,500 of non-cash compensation) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in compensation expense for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to decreases in personnel and compensation in executive,
marketing, sales and operations departments as a result of cost savings and synergies realized. Also contributing to the decrease was
the recording during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of compensation expense for (1) non-cash stock-based compensation of approximately
 5,500 related to the accelerated vesting of equity award grants and additional stock-based compensation associated with the resignation
of our former Chief Executive Officer pursuant to the terms of his Executive Chairman and CEO Employment Agreement, dated May 28, 2021
(the Former CEO Employment Agreement ), as set forth in the Separation and General Release Agreement, dated as of September
20, 2023, between our Company and the former Chief Executive Officer; and (2) non-recurring expenses of approximately 11,500, consisting
of the non-recurring payment of approximately 6,100 to our former Chief Executive Officer pursuant to the Former CEO Employment Agreement
and non-recurring bonus expense of 6,000 related to the achievement of key performance milestones by our Chief Technology Officer under
his employment agreement, dated April 12, 2021. Furthermore, the decrease in compensation expense was partially offset by severance expense
of 1,200 recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 associated with the cost reduction plans we initiated during
2024. 

General
and administrative expenses decreased by 2,684 , or 10 ,
to 23,782 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 26,466 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in consulting/other professional services, marketing,
software licensing, recruiting and investor/public relations of 2,888 partially offset by increases in accounting/auditing, legal expenditures
and bad debt expenses of 1,173. Further, general and administrative expenses decreased due to a decrease in amortization expense of
 1,754. 

Other
operating expenses increased by 2,505 , or 18 ,
to 16,135 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 14,555 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in loss on sale of assets, software licensing and property/use taxes expenses of
 3,073 partially offset by decreases in insurance, website, rent, annual meeting, hardware and software development expenditures, travel
and vehicle expenditures of 2,318 for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 

23 

The
Company recorded a loss on change in fair value of consideration payable related to the Envoy acquisition of 2,811 in the 2024 period
due to the change in the inputs to the probability-weighted discounted cash flow model. There was no such amount recognized in the 2023
period. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we observed certain triggering events, including a decline in our stock price and, as a result,
we conducted a quantitative impairment analysis of our goodwill and intangible assets and determined that the fair value of certain reporting
units were less than the carrying amount and, as a result, recorded an impairment charge of 69,111 related to goodwill during the 2024
period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we observed certain triggering events, including a decline in our stock price
and, as a result, we conducted a quantitative impairment analysis of our goodwill and intangible assets and determined that the fair
value of our reporting units were less than the carrying amount and, as a result, recorded an impairment charge of 89,087 related to
goodwill and 5,143 related to intangible assets during the 2023 period. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

We
recorded other income of 1,911 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as
compared to other expense of 2,105) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of
 1,043 related to dividend and interest income, and by a decrease in interest expense of 1,898 compared to the 2023 period and a
decrease on loss on extinguishment of notes payable of 1,036. 

Net
Loss 

Our
net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 59,383 or 32 ,
to 124,621 as compared to 184,004 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross profit. 

Total
Comprehensive Loss 

Our
total comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 123,659 whereas
our total comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 185,387. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following: 

September 30, 2024 
 December 31, 2023 

(unaudited) 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 64,584 
 121,691 

Working Capital 
 96,596 
 152,033 

Debt 
 265 
 38,108 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we financed our activities from proceeds derived from equity financings occurring in prior
periods. A significant portion of the funds raised from the sale of capital stock has been used to cover working capital needs and personnel,
office expenses and various consulting and professional fees. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we used cash of 34,830 and 77,162,
respectively, in operations. Our cash use for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to our net loss of
 124,621, adjusted for net non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of 89,612 , partially
offset by 179 of net cash provided by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities.
Our cash use for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to our net loss of 184,004, adjusted for net non-cash
expenses in the aggregate amount of 129,253, partially offset by 22,411 of net cash used in changes in the levels of operating
assets and liabilities. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 9,738 ,
of which, 9,577 was used to purchase charging stations and other fixed assets and 161
 related to the capitalization of certain engineering costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in
investing activities was 12,451, of which 7,265 was used to purchase charging stations and other fixed assets, 4,660 was used as cash
consideration for Envoy (net of cash acquired) and 526 related to the capitalization of certain engineering costs. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was 13,731 ,
of which, 37,881 was used to pay down notes payable, 582
 was used to pay down our liability in connection with a finance lease and 338 was
used to pay down our liability in connection with internal use software, partially offset by 25,070
 provided by offering proceeds related to the sale of common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided
by financing activities was 120,891, of which, 122,379 was provided by offering proceeds related to the sale of common stock, 835
was provided by the exercise of options and warrants, offset by 2,103 used to pay down our liability in connection with a finance lease
and 220 used to pay down our liability in connection with internal use software. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents, working capital and an accumulated deficit of 64,584 ,
 96,596 and 662,344 , respectively. During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 87,389 and 124,621
 respectively. 

In
February 2023, the Company completed an underwritten registered public offering of 8,333,333 shares of its common stock at a public offering
price of 12.00 per share. The Company received approximately 100,000 in gross proceeds from the public offering and 94,766 in net
proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses paid by the Company. The public offering was made pursuant to
our automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on January 6, 2021, and prospectus supplement dated February
8, 2023. Barclays acted as the sole book-running manager for the offering. H.C. Wainwright Co., Roth Capital Partners and ThinkEquity
acted as co-managers for the offering. The underwriters did not exercise the over-allotment granted to them in connection with the offering. 

24 

We
have not yet achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur cash outflows from operations Historically, we have been able to
raise funds to support our business operations, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising significant
additional funds in the future. We expect that our cash on hand will fund our operations for at least 12 months after the issuance date
of the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Since
inception, our operations have primarily been funded through proceeds received in equity and debt financings. We believe we have access
to capital resources and continue to evaluate additional financing opportunities. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain
funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds we might raise will enable us
to complete our EV development initiatives or attain profitable operations. 

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments 

We
have operating and finance lease obligations over the next five years of approximately 10,385. These operating lease obligations are
primarily related to corporate office space, warehousing, and parking spaces related to our car-sharing services. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had purchase
commitments of approximately 2,300 which will become payable upon the suppliers service of warranty contracts. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures are in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us
to make estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements,
as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon
which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments. To the extent
that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial results will be affected. The accounting
policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding
and evaluating our reported financial results are described below. 

We
consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from
period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Management
has identified certain critical accounting estimates which are outlined below. In addition, there are other items within our financial
statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical, as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items
could have a material impact on our financial statements. 

Business
Combination 

We
follow the acquisition method of accounting to record identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized in connection with
acquired businesses at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets from business combinations
are recognized at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition and consist of customer relationships, developed technology
and trade names. Determination of the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets requires judgment. The fair value of intangible
assets is estimated using the relief from royalty method for the acquired developed technology and trade names and the multi-period excess
earnings method for the acquired customer relationships. The fair value of non-compete agreements is estimated using the discounted cash
flow approach. All of these fair value methods are income-based valuation approaches, which require judgment to estimate appropriate
discount rates, royalty rates related to the developed technology and trade name intangible assets, revenue growth attributable to the
intangible assets and remaining useful lives. 

Consideration
payable liability is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the probability
of achieving certain milestones. In order to perform the fair value calculations the
following estimates are considered: probability of a public offering and discount rates . The
fair value for consideration payable is reviewed each quarter after the original
valuation to determine if revised estimates are necessary. 

Long-Lived
Assets 

Long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not
be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of its long-lived assets by monitoring current selling prices of car charging units in the
open market, the adoption rate of various auto manufacturers in the EV market and projected car charging utilization at various public
car charging stations throughout its network in determining fair value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future
cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Fair value is
determined using various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent
appraisals, as necessary. 

Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment 

Goodwill
is the excess of consideration paid for an acquired entity over the fair value of the amounts assigned to assets acquired, including
other identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed in a business combination. To determine the amount of goodwill resulting
from a business combination, the Company performs an assessment to determine the acquisition date fair value of the acquired company s
tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities. 

Goodwill
is evaluated for impairment on November 1 of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired.
An entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a
determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. These qualitative
factors include: macroeconomic and industry conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific
events. If the entity determines that this threshold is met, then the Company may apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount
of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount
of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company considered the decline in
its stock price to be an indicator of impairment and, accordingly, performed a quantitative impairment assessment of its goodwill. 

The
Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company identifies the Company s reporting units by assessing
whether the components of the Company constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management
regularly reviews the operating results of those components. The Company s goodwill is contained in the Legacy Blink reporting
unit resulting from the acquisition of SemaConnect and the Mobility reporting unit resulting from the acquisition of Envoy Technologies. 

25 

The
Company determines fair value through multiple valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and
third-party independent appraisals and weighs the results accordingly. The Company is required to make certain subjective and complex
judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred, including assumptions and estimates used to determine
the fair value of its reporting units. Reporting unit fair value estimates include significant assumptions such as: revenue growth rates,
operating margins, estimated royalty rates, company-specific risk premiums used in the weighted-average cost of capital, and certain
multiples, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. The Company performs sensitivity analyses on
significant assumptions to evaluate how changes in the estimated fair values of reporting units respond to changes in assumptions, specifically
the revenue growth rates and the weighted-average cost of capital. 

Based
on its analysis, the Company determined that the Legacy Blink reporting unit s carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value
as of September 30, 2024. Consequently, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 69,111 during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

As
a result of the impairment analysis it was determined that the Mobility reporting unit qualifies as at risk for impairment.
The Company quantitatively defines at risk as a percentage of the excess of the reporting unit s fair value over its carrying
amount that is less than 10 . An at risk reporting unit qualitatively represents a reporting unit with a higher degree
of uncertainty of the reporting unit s ability to meet its forecasted cash flows based upon revenue growth rate and operating margin
assumptions relied upon in the estimation of its fair value. As of September 2024, the Mobility reporting unit s carrying value
exceeded its fair value by approximately 4 . The goodwill attributable to the Mobility reporting unit as of September 30, 2024 was 27,536.

 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Foreign
Currency Risk 

We
have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily
the euro, causing both our revenue and our operating results to be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates. Gains or losses from
the revaluation of certain cash balances, accounts receivable balances and intercompany balances that are denominated in these currencies
impact our net loss. A hypothetical decrease in all foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar of 1 would not result in a material foreign
currency loss on foreign-denominated balances, as of September 30, 2024. As our foreign operations expand, our results may be more materially
impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies in which we do business. At this time, we do not enter into financial
instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. 

ITEM
 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of September 30, 2024, being the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our management conducted an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based
on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as discussed
in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in the Company s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, under the heading
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, management continued to commit resources to the remediation of the material weaknesses reported
in the Company s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Furthermore, management continued to augment its resources
for remediating the identified deficiencies in information technology general controls and in other internal controls over financial
reporting. 

Except
for the above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September
30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 RISK FACTORS. 

In
addition to the information set forth under Item 1A of Part I in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,
and under a similar item in subsequent periodic reports, the information set forth at the beginning of Management s Discussion
and Analysis entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information, and updates noted below, you should consider
that there are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually
occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the trading
price of our common stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment. These risk factors may not identify
all risks that we face and our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider
to be immaterial to our operations. 

We
have a history of substantial net losses and expect losses to continue in the future; if we do not achieve and sustain profitability
our financial condition could suffer. 

We
have experienced substantial net losses, and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred
net losses of approximately 87 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. As of
September 30, 2024, we had net working capital of approximately 97 million and an accumulated
deficit of approximately 662 million. We have not yet achieved profitability. 

If
our revenue grows slower than we anticipate, or if our operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability
and our financial condition could suffer. We can give no assurance that we will ever achieve profitable operations. Even if we achieve
profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Whether we can achieve cash flow levels
sufficient to support our operations cannot be accurately predicted. We may need to borrow additional funds or sell our debt or equity
securities, or some combination of both, to provide funding for our operations in the future. Such additional funding may not be available
on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
