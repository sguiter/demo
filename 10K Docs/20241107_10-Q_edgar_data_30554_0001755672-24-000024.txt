 percent to the company's annual net sales and less than percent to each of the company's annual Seed and Crop Protection segment operating EBITDA. The company remeasures net monetary assets utilizing the official Argentine Peso Peso to USD exchange rate. The ability to draw down Peso cash balances is limited at this time due to government restrictions and market availability of U.S. Dollars. The devaluation of the Peso relative to the USD over the last several years has resulted in the recognition of exchange losses (refer to Note 6 Supplementary Information, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, and Note 7 Supplementary Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the company's 2023 Annual Report). The Argentina government has offered USD-denominated bonds to importers, the proceeds from which could be used to pay off outstanding intercompany payables. During the first quarter of 2024, the company purchased million of these foreign government bonds as part of its strategy to manage its net monetary asset exposure in Argentina. Refer to the Debt Securities section in Note 16 - Financial Instruments, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. As of September 30, 2024, a further percent deterioration in the official Peso to USD exchange rate would not have a significant impact on the USD value of our net monetary assets or pre-tax earnings. The company will continue to assess the implications to our operations and financial reporting.

 Contract Balances 
 Contract liabilities primarily reflect deferred revenue from prepayments under contracts with customers where the company receives advance payments for products to be delivered in future periods. Corteva classifies deferred revenue as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when the company expects to recognize revenue. Contract assets primarily include amounts related to conditional rights to consideration for completed performance not yet invoiced. Accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.

 Restricted cash equivalents is primarily comprised of a trust funded by EIDP for cash obligations under certain non-qualified benefit and deferred compensation plans due to the Merger, which was a change in control event, and contributions to escrow accounts established for the settlement of certain legal matters and the settlement of legacy PFAS matters and the associated qualified spend. During the second quarter of 2024, the previously-restricted cash in the Water District Settlement Fund, which was established by the settling companies in September 2023 under the Nationwide Water District Settlement, was released. Collective contributions amounted to billion, with Chemours contributing 50 percent and DuPont and Corteva collectively contributing the remaining 50 percent pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement.

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the company recognized million and million, respectively, of net tax benefits for income taxes on continuing operations associated with changes in deferred taxes and accruals for certain prior year tax positions in various jurisdictions as well as from stock-based compensation. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the company recognized million and million, respectively, of net tax benefits for income taxes on continuing operations associated with changes in deferred taxes, accruals for certain prior year tax positions in various jurisdictions, stock-based compensation, as well as the impact of changes to deferred taxes associated with a tax currency change for a legal entity. 
 
 The company routinely uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The objective of the program, which resides in the U.S., is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies in order to minimize, on an after-tax basis, the effects of exchange rate changes on net monetary asset positions, which can drive material impacts on the company's effective tax rate. For further discussion of pre-tax and after-tax impacts of the company's foreign currency hedging program and net monetary asset programs, refer to Note 6 - Supplementary Information, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

The company enters into various factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell its trade receivables under both recourse and non-recourse agreements in exchange for cash proceeds. These financing arrangements result in a transfer of the company's receivables and risks to the third party. As these transfers qualify as true sales under the applicable accounting guidance, the receivables are derecognized from the interim Consolidated Balance Sheets upon transfer, and the company receives a payment for the receivables from the third party within a mutually agreed upon time period. For arrangements involving an element of recourse, which is typically provided through a guarantee of accounts in the event of customer default, the guarantee obligation is measured using market data from similar transactions and reported as a current liability in the interim Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Trade receivables sold under these agreements were million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these agreements which include an element of recourse as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 were million, million and million, respectively. The net proceeds received are included in cash provided by (used for) operating activities in the interim Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The difference between the carrying amount of the trade receivables sold and the sum of the cash received is recorded as a loss on sale of receivables in other income (expense) - net, in the interim Consolidated Statements of Operations. The loss on sale of receivables was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the company s guarantees.

 The estimated fair value of the company's short-term and long-term borrowings, including interest rate financial instruments, was determined using Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. Based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues, or on current rates offered to the company for debt of the same remaining maturities, the fair value of the company's short-term borrowings and finance lease obligations approximated carrying value. 
 
 The fair value of the company s long-term borrowings, including debt due within one year, was million, million and million as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

The Revolving Credit Facilities may serve as a substitute to the company's commercial paper program, and can be used, from time to time, for general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, the funding of seasonal working capital needs. The Revolving Credit Facilities contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are typical for companies with similar credit ratings. Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facilities contain a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization for Corteva and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed .

million, million and million, respectively, of such obligations. These amounts represent the maximum potential amount of future (undiscounted) payments that the company could be required to make under the guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed party. Of the maximum future payments at September 30, 2024, approximately million had terms greater than one year. The maximum future payments include million, million and million at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively, of guarantees related to the various factoring agreements into which the company enters with third-party financial institutions to sell its trade receivables. See Note 9 - Accounts and Notes Receivable - Net, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 
 
 The maximum future payments also include agreements with lenders to establish programs that provide financing for select customers. The terms of the guarantees are equivalent to the terms of the customer loans that are primarily made to finance customer invoices. The total amounts owed from customers to the lenders relating to these agreements was million, million and million at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The company assesses the payment/performance risk by assigning default rates based on the duration of the guarantees. These default rates are assigned based on the external credit rating of the counterparty or through internal credit analysis and historical default history for counterparties that do not have published credit ratings. For counterparties without an external rating or available credit history, a cumulative average default rate is used. 
 
 Indemnifications under Separation Agreements 
 The company has entered into various agreements where the company is indemnified for certain liabilities. The term of this indemnification is generally indefinite, with exceptions, and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. 
 
 Chemours Separation Agreement (Performance Chemicals) 
 Pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement resulting from the 2015 spin-off of the Performance Chemicals segment from Historical DuPont, Chemours indemnifies the company against certain litigation, environmental, workers' compensation and other liabilities that arose prior to the distribution. 
 
 In 2017, the Chemours Separation Agreement was amended to provide for a limited sharing of potential future liabilities related to alleged historical releases of perfluorooctanoic acids and its ammonium salts PFOA for a five-year period that began on July 6, 2017. In addition, in 2017, Chemours and EIDP settled multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio Ohio MDL ), resolving claims of about plaintiffs alleging injury from exposure to PFOA in drinking water as a result of the historical manufacture or use of PFOA at the Washington Works plant outside Parkersburg, West Virginia. This plant was previously owned and/or operated by the Performance Chemicals segment of EIDP and is now owned and/or operated by Chemours. 
 
 On May 13, 2019, Chemours filed suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against DuPont, EIDP, and Corteva, seeking, among other things, to limit its responsibility for the litigation and environmental liabilities allocated to and assumed by Chemours under the Chemours Separation Agreement (the Delaware Litigation ). On March 30, 2020, the Court of Chancery granted a motion to dismiss. On December 15, 2020, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Chancery. Meanwhile, a confidential arbitration process regarding the same and other claims proceeded (the Arbitration ). 
 
 On January 22, 2021, Chemours, DuPont, Corteva and EIDP entered into a binding memorandum of understanding containing a settlement to resolve legal disputes originating from the Delaware Litigation and Arbitration, and to establish a cost sharing arrangement and escrow account to be used to support and manage potential future legacy per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS liabilities arising out of pre-July 1, 2015 conduct (the MOU ). The MOU replaced the 2017 amendment to the Chemours Separation Agreement. According to the terms of the cost sharing arrangement within the MOU, Corteva and DuPont together, on one hand, and Chemours, on the other hand, agreed to a 50-50 split of certain qualified expenses related to PFAS liabilities incurred over a term not to exceed or billion of qualified spend and escrow account contributions (see below for discussion of the escrow account) in the aggregate. DuPont s and Corteva s share under the MOU will be limited to billion, including qualified expenses and escrow account contributions. These expenses and escrow account contributions will be subject to the existing Letter Agreement, under which DuPont and Corteva will each bear of the first million (up to million each), and thereafter DuPont bears and Corteva bears the remaining . Under the terms of the MOU, Corteva s estimated aggregate share of the potential billion is approximately million.

million into an escrow account and DuPont and Corteva shall together deposit million in the aggregate into an escrow account and (2) no later than September 30 of each subsequent year through and including 2028, Chemours shall deposit million into an escrow account and DuPont and Corteva shall together deposit million in the aggregate into an escrow account. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the MOU, each party may be permitted to defer funding in any year (excluding 2021). Over this period, Chemours will deposit a total of million in the account and DuPont and Corteva will deposit an additional million pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement. Additionally, if on December 31, 2028, the balance of the escrow account (including interest) is less than million, Chemours will make of the deposits and DuPont and Corteva together will make of the deposits necessary to restore the balance of the escrow account to million, pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement. Such payments will be made in a series of consecutive annual equal installments commencing on September 30, 2029, pursuant to the escrow account replenishment terms as set forth in the MOU. The MOU provides that no withdrawals from the MOU Escrow Account can be made before year six, except to fund mutually agreed upon third-party settlements in excess of million. Starting with year six, withdrawals can only be made to fund qualified spend if the parties aggregate qualified spend in that particular year is greater than million. Beginning with year 11, the amounts in the MOU Escrow Account can be used to fund any qualified spend. The company made its annual installment deposits due to the MOU Escrow Account through September 30, 2024. 
 
 In April 2024, Corteva, EIDP, DuPont, and Chemours received a final judgment resolving all drinking water claims related to PFAS of a defined class of U.S. public water systems that serve the vast majority of the United States population (the Nationwide Water District Settlement ). In connection with the Nationwide Water District Settlement, the MOU was supplemented to waive funding due to the MOU Escrow Account by Chemours, DuPont and Corteva for 2023 provided that each party fully funds its portion of the Nationwide Water District Settlement and said settlement is consummated. The funding obligation to the MOU Escrow Account with respect to 2024 and due September 30, 2024 was to be waived if (i) between October 1, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the parties had entered into settlement agreements resolving liabilities under the MOU that in the aggregate exceed million; (ii) each company had fully funded its respective share, in accordance with the MOU, of such settlements; and (iii) such settlements were consummated. No such waiver was triggered for the 2024 escrow funding obligation due September 30, 2024 and, therefore, the company made its required contribution. 
 
 After the term of this arrangement, Chemours indemnification obligations under the original 2015 Chemours Separation Agreement, would continue unchanged, subject in each case to certain exceptions set out in the MOU. Under the MOU, Chemours waived specified claims regarding the construct of its 2015 spin-off transaction, and the parties dismissed the pending arbitration regarding those claims. Additionally, the parties have agreed to resolve the Ohio MDL PFOA personal injury litigation (as discussed below). The parties are expected to cooperate in good faith to enter into additional agreements reflecting the terms set forth in the MOU. 
 
 Corteva Separation Agreement 
 On April 1, 2019, in connection with the Dow Distribution, Corteva, DuPont and Dow entered into the Corteva Separation Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement ("TMA"), the Employee Matters Agreement, and certain other agreements (collectively, the Corteva Separation Agreements ). The Corteva Separation Agreements allocate among Corteva, DuPont and Dow assets, employees, certain liabilities and obligations (including its investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) and provides for indemnification obligation among the parties. Under the Corteva Separation Agreement, DuPont indemnifies Corteva against certain litigation, environmental, tax, workers' compensation and other liabilities that arose prior to the Corteva Distribution, Dow indemnifies Corteva against certain litigation, environmental, tax, workers' compensation and other liabilities that relate to the Historical Dow business, and Corteva indemnifies DuPont and Dow for certain liabilities. 
 
 Indemnification matters under the Corteva Separation Agreements contain dispute resolution clauses. Corteva and DuPont are pursuing a resolution of a matter under the terms of the TMA. The company believes its interpretation of the TMA is correct, but it is reasonably possible that the required third party assessment may differ from our interpretation, which could have a significant impact to the current carrying value of our indemnification liability. Under the terms of the TMA, the dispute resolution process is expected to be concluded in the first half of 2025. 
 
 Under the Corteva Separation Agreements, certain legacy EIDP liabilities from discontinued and/or divested operations and businesses of EIDP (including Performance Chemicals) (a stray liability were allocated to Corteva or DuPont. For those stray liabilities allocated to Corteva and DuPont (which may include a specified amount of liability associated with that liability), Corteva and DuPont are responsible for liabilities in an amount up to that specified amount plus an additional million each. Once each company has met the million threshold, Corteva and DuPont will share future liabilities

and , respectively; provided, however, that for PFAS, DuPont managed such liabilities with Corteva and DuPont sharing the costs on a - basis starting from and up to million (with such amount, up to million, to be credited to each company s million threshold) and once the million threshold was met, the companies share proportionally on the basis of and respectively, subject to a million de minimis requirement. The aggregate amount of cash remitted by Corteva has exceeded the stray liability thresholds, including PFAS, noted above. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the indemnification assets were million, million and million, respectively, within accounts and notes receivable - net and million, million and million, respectively, within other assets in the interim Consolidated Balance Sheets. At September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the indemnification liabilities were million, million and million, respectively, within accrued and other current liabilities and million, million and million, respectively, within other noncurrent obligations in the interim Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Discontinued Operations Activity 
 The company recorded benefits (charges) of ) million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and ) million and ) million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to income (loss) from discontinued operations after income taxes, in the interim Consolidated Statements of Operations. The after-tax charge for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by litigation-related activity. The after-tax benefits recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by charges recognized relating to the MOU with Chemours and DuPont relating to PFAS environmental remediation activities primarily at Chemours' Fayetteville Works facility and litigation-related activity, more than offset by a favorable adjustment of certain prior year tax positions for previously divested businesses and the derecognition of an indemnification liability associated with the Water District Settlement Fund contribution. The after-tax charges recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to the settlement of certain legacy PFAS related legal matters that are subject to the MOU, including the Nationwide Water District Settlement. 
 
 Litigation 
 The company is subject to various legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, product liability, intellectual property, antitrust, commercial, property damage, personal injury, environmental and regulatory matters arising out of the normal course of its current businesses or legacy EIDP businesses unrelated to Corteva s current businesses but allocated to Corteva as part of the separation of Corteva from DuPont. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these various proceedings, as considerable uncertainty exists. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accruals may reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice from counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. For the litigation matters discussed below, management believes that it is reasonably possible that the company could incur liabilities in excess of amounts accrued, for which the ultimate liability could be material to the results of operations and the cash flows in the period recognized. However, the company is unable to estimate the possible loss beyond amounts accrued due to various reasons, including, among others, that the underlying matters are either in early stages and/or have significant factual issues to be resolved. In addition, even when the company believes it has substantial defenses, the company may consider settlement of matters if it believes it is in the best interest of the company. 
 
 Lorsban Lawsuits 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were pending personal injury lawsuits filed and additional asserted claims against the former Dow Agrosciences LLC, alleging injuries related to chlorpyrifos exposure, the active ingredient in Lorsban , an insecticide used by commercial farms for field fruit, nut and vegetable crops. Corteva ended its production of Lorsban in 2020. Chlorpyrifos products are restricted-use pesticides, which are not available for purchase or use by the general public, and may only be sold to, and used by, certified applicators or someone under the certified applicator's direct supervision. These lawsuits do not relate to Dursban , a residential type chlorpyrifos product that was authorized for indoor purposes, which was discontinued over two decades ago prior to the Merger and Corteva s formation and Separation. Claimants allege personal injury, including autism, developmental delays and/or decreased neurologic function, resulting from farm worker exposure and bystander drift and in utero exposure to chlorpyrifos. Certain claimants have also put forth remediation claims due to alleged property contamination from chlorpyrifos. As of September 30, 2024, an accrual has been established for the estimated resolution of certain claims. 
 
 Federal Trade Commission Investigation 
 On May 26, 2020, Corteva received a subpoena from the Federal Trade Commission FTC directing it to submit documents pertaining to its Crop Protection products generally, as well as business plans, rebate programs, offers, pricing and marketing materials specifically related to its acetochlor, oxamyl, rimsulfuron and other related products in order to determine whether

members. In addition to relief that was provided to class members years ago, the settlement requires EIDP to continue providing PFOA water treatment to area water districts and private well users and to fund, through an escrow account, up to million for a medical monitoring program for eligible class members. As of September 30, 2024, approximately million had been disbursed from the account since its establishment in 2012 and the remaining balance is approximately million. 
 
 The Leach settlement permits class members to pursue personal injury claims for health conditions (and no others) that an expert panel appointed under the settlement reported in 2012 had a probable link (as defined in the settlement) with PFOA: pregnancy-induced hypertension, including preeclampsia; kidney cancer; testicular cancer; thyroid disease; ulcerative colitis; and diagnosed high cholesterol. After the panel reported its findings, approximately personal injury lawsuits were filed in federal and state courts in Ohio and West Virginia and consolidated in multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio Ohio MDL ). The Ohio MDL was settled in early 2017 for approximately million in cash, with Chemours and EIDP (without indemnification from Chemours) each paying half. 
 
 Post-MDL Settlement PFOA Personal Injury Claims 
 The 2017 Ohio MDL settlement did not resolve claims of plaintiffs who did not have claims in the Ohio MDL or whose claims are based on diseases first diagnosed after February 11, 2017. 
 
 In January 2021, Chemours, DuPont and Corteva agreed to settle approximately filed and unfiled matters remaining in the Ohio MDL for million, with Chemours contributing million to the settlement, and DuPont and Corteva contributing million each. The company paid million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The defendants have reached a tentative settlement of all of the currently filed and unfiled personal injury cases in the Ohio MDL contingent upon the court dissolving the MDL. As of September 30, 2024, an accrual has been established for the estimated resolution of these claims.

cases remain filed against 3M and other defendants, including EIDP and Chemours, and some including Corteva and DuPont, alleging personal injury (primarily prostate, kidney, and testicular cancer) from the use of aqueous film-forming foams AFFF and consolidated in a multi-district litigation proceeding in federal district court in South Carolina SC MDL ). Most of these recent cases also assert claims that the EIDP and Chemours separation constituted a fraudulent conveyance. The SC MDL ordered the dismissal of plaintiff claims by September 10, 2024, without prejudice, if such plaintiff could not produce peer reviewed science and expert reports supporting PFAS as both the general and specific causation of their personal injury. The trial for the first potential bellwether personal injury cases are expected to begin in October 2025. Additionally, in December 2023, a class action was filed in Canada against 3M and other defendants, including EIDP and Chemours, alleging PFOS and PFOA environmental contamination and personal injury from use of AFFF. 
 
 Nationwide Water District Settlement. In April 2024, Corteva, EIDP, DuPont, and Chemours (collectively, the settling companies comprehensively resolved all drinking water claims related to PFAS of a defined class of U.S. public water systems that serve the vast majority of the United States population, including, but not limited to the AFFF claims in the SC MDL, under the Nationwide Water District Settlement. PFAS, as defined in the settlement, includes PFOA and HFPO-DA, among a broad range of fluorinated organic substances. The Nationwide Water District Settlement was entered into solely by way of compromise and settlement and is not in any way an admission of liability or fault by Corteva or EIDP. 
 
 The class represented by the Nationwide Water District Settlement is composed of all Public Water Systems, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 300f, with a current detection of PFAS or that are currently required to monitor for PFAS under the Environmental Protection Agency s Fifth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule UCMR 5 or other applicable federal or state law (the Class ). Approximately 88 percent of the U.S. is served by systems required to test under UCMR 5. The Class does not include water systems owned and operated by a State or the United States government; small systems that have not detected the presence of PFAS and are not currently required to monitor for it under federal or state requirements; and, unless they otherwise request to be included, water systems in the lower Cape Fear River Basin of North Carolina. The total number of requests for exclusion opt-outs was approximately 900 water districts, while most public water districts (approximately 93 percent of the Class) remain in the class settlement. 
 
 New Jersey . In late March 2019, the New Jersey State Attorney General filed four lawsuits against EIDP, Chemours, and others alleging that operations at and discharges from former EIDP sites in New Jersey (Chambers Works, Pompton Lakes, Parlin and Repauno) damaged the State s natural resources. Two of these lawsuits (those involving the Chambers Works and Parlin sites) allege contamination from PFAS. DuPont and Corteva were subsequently added as defendants to these lawsuits. These lawsuits include claims under the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act ISRA and for fraudulent conveyance. These cases are proceeding to trial with the Chambers Works site case expected to begin in June 2025. 
 
 EIDP and Chemours are also defendants in lawsuits by a private water utility provider in New Jersey and New York alleging damages from PFAS releases into the environment, that impacted water sources that the utilities use to provide water, as well as product liability, negligence, nuisance, and trespass claims. The court dismissed the New York plaintiff's trespass claims and limited plaintiffs nuisance claims to abatement damages. 
 
 Ohio . EIDP is a defendant in lawsuits, including an action by the State of Ohio based on alleged damage to natural resources. The natural resources damage claim was settled in December 2023 for million and received final approval

million. The second, a putative nationwide class action ("the Hardwick Class Action") brought on behalf of anyone who has detectable levels of PFAS in their blood serum seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, including the establishment of a PFAS Science Panel . In December 2023, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the Hardwick Class Action due to lack of standing by Mr. Hardwick. With further opportunities for appeals expired, the plaintiffs filed a new case, narrowing their original claims, in June 2024. 
 
 New York . EIDP is a defendant in a putative class action (the "Baker Class Action"), brought by persons who live in and around Hoosick Falls, New York asserting claims for medical monitoring and property damage based on alleged PFOA releases from manufacturing facilities owned and operated by co-defendants in Hoosick Falls. The lawsuits allege that EIDP and others supplied materials used at these facilities resulting in PFOA air and water contamination. A court approved settlement was reached between the plaintiffs and the other co-defendants regarding the Baker Class Action case. In September 2022, the class certification of the Baker Class Action was granted, with the court certifying three separate classes consisting of a private well property damage class, a medical monitoring class and a nuisance class. EIDP will challenge the certification and continue to defend itself on the merits of the case, while seeking an out of court resolution. 
 
 EIDP is a defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Town of East Hampton, New York alleging PFOA and PFOS contamination of the town s water wells. This district submitted a timely op-out request from the Nationwide Water District Settlement. 
 
 Other Natural Resource Damage Cases. In addition to the natural resource damage cases in New Jersey and New York, natural resource damage filed lawsuits against EIDP, Chemours, and others, claiming, among other things, PFC (including PFOA) contamination of groundwater and drinking water, have been filed in 31 other states, the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. Certain cases also name DuPont and Corteva as defendants and include claims of fraudulent conveyance. The complaints seek reimbursement for past and future costs to investigate and remediate the alleged contamination and compensation for the loss of value and use of the state s natural resources. Due to overlapping AFFF allegations, virtually all of these cases have been transferred, or are pending transfer to the SC MDL. These cases are largely in the discovery phase. While the recent mediation of the natural resource case in North Carolina and New Jersey concluded without resolution, discussions continue between the parties to seek a resolution. 
 
 On July 13, 2021, Chemours, DuPont, EIDP and Corteva entered into a settlement agreement with the State of Delaware reflecting the companies' and the State's agreement to settle and fully resolve claims alleged against the companies regarding their historical Delaware operations, manufacturing, use and disposal of all chemical compounds, including PFAS. Under the settlement, if the companies, individually or jointly, within years of the settlement, enter into a proportionally similar agreement to settle or resolve claims of another state for PFAS-related natural resource damages, for an amount greater than million, the companies shall make a supplemental payment directly to the Natural Resources and Sustainability Trust (the NRS Trust in an amount equal to such other states recovery in excess of million ("Supplemental Payment"). Supplemental Payment(s), if any, will not exceed million in the aggregate. All amounts paid by the companies under the settlement are subject to the MOU and the Corteva Separation Agreement. Due to the settlement of natural resource damages claims with the State of Ohio, the one-time Supplemental Payment will be triggered when further opportunities for appeals expires under the Ohio judicial consent order process, with Corteva s share under the MOU being approximately million. Under the settlement, if the state sues other parties and those parties seek contribution from the companies, the companies will have protection from contribution up to the amounts previously paid under the settlement agreement. The companies will also receive a credit up to the amount of the payment if the state seeks natural resource damage claims against the companies outside the scope of the settlement s release of claims. 
 
 Canada. The Province of British Columbia, filed a class action against various defendants, including 3M, DuPont Canada, EIDP, and Chemours alleging harms caused by PFAS/AFFF. The class consists of all municipalities, regional districts, and other governance authorities and other persons in Canada that were responsible for a Drinking Water System from 1970 to the present. The plaintiff seeks to recover costs for the treatment and restoration of natural resources, as well as property, economic, and punitive damages. A putative class action was also filed in July 2024 on behalf of citizens of Quebec, Canada seeking class certification to recover for alleged PFAS and AFFF contamination of private wells and public water treatment facilities. 
 
 Netherlands . In April 2021, four municipalities in the Netherlands filed complaints alleging contamination of land and groundwater resulting from the emission of PFOA and GenX by Corteva, DuPont and Chemours. The municipalities seek to recover costs incurred due to the alleged emissions, including damages for investigation costs, construction project delays, depreciation of land, soil remediation, liabilities to contractors, and attorneys fees. In September 2023, the court entered a second interlocutory judgment, ruling, inter alia, that defendants were liable to the municipalities for PFOA emissions during a certain time period, and the removal costs of deposited emissions on the municipalities land infringes their property rights by an

private property owners near the Fayetteville Works facility filed a complaint against Chemours and EIDP. The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages for their claims of private nuisance, trespass, negligence and property damage allegedly caused by release of certain PFCs. In March 2023, CFPUA filed a Delaware Chancery Court action claiming the spin-off of Chemours and the Dow and Historical DuPont merger were unlawful and should be voided, so CFPUA is not precluded from recovering amounts it is entitled in its pending litigation. EIDP filed a motion to dismiss the Delaware Chancery Court action based upon failure to state a claim under Delaware law in June 2023, along with a counterclaim in October 2023. CFPUA s motion to stay the case was granted in January 2024. In addition, several personal injury cases have been filed alleging thyroid disease, and prostate, breast and kidney cancers as a result of PFAS exposure. 
 
 Generally, site-related expenses related to GenX claims are subject to the cost sharing arrangements as defined in the MOU. 
 
 Environmental 
 Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. These obligations are included in accrued and other current liabilities and other noncurrent obligations in the interim Consolidated Balance Sheets. It is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates primarily due to unknown conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies for handling site remediation and restoration.

 On January 28, 2022, the State of New Jersey filed a request for a preliminary injunction against EIDP and Chemours seeking the establishment of a Remediation Funding Source RFS in an amount exceeding million for environmental remediation at EIDP s former Chambers Works facility in New Jersey. The RFS primarily relates to non-PFAS remediation, which is not subject to the MOU. Chemours has accepted indemnity and defense for these matters, while reserving rights and declining EIDP s demand relating to the ISRA and fraudulent transfer matters as alleged under the existing New Jersey natural resource lawsuits discussed on page 26. 
 
 Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy, AltEn Facility 
 The EPA and the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy NDEE are pursuing investigations, response and removal actions, litigation and enforcement action related to an ethanol plant located near Mead, Nebraska that is owned and operated by AltEn LLC AltEn ). The agencies have alleged violations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA and other federal and state laws stemming from AltEn s lack of compliance with the terms and conditions of its operating permits and other regulatory requirements. Corteva is one of six seed companies, who were customers of AltEn (collectively, the "Facility Response Group"), participating in the NDEE s Voluntary Cleanup Program to address certain interim remediation needs at the site. In February 2022, the Facility Response Group filed a lawsuit against AltEn and certain of its affiliates to preserve certain contractual and common law indemnification claims. As of September 30, 2024, an accrual was established for Corteva s estimated voluntary contribution to the solid waste and wastewater remedial action plans for the AltEn location. 
 
 California Department of Toxic Substances Control, Pittsburg Plant 
 The California Department of Toxic Substances Control DTSC has filed a state court lawsuit over challenging whether the Pittsburg plant s high purity water system HPWS ), as operated by Dow and now Corteva, required a permit pursuant to the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA ). Discussions between the parties remain ongoing and further litigation, including discovery, is stayed.

 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value per share, without an expiration date ("2022 Share Buyback Plan"). The timing, price and volume of purchases will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws and other factors. In connection with the 2022 Share Buyback Plan, the company repurchased and retired shares and shares in the open market for a total cost (excluding excise taxes) of million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and shares and shares in the open market for a total cost (excluding excise taxes) of million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. 
 
 On August 5, 2021, Corteva, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized a billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value per share, without an expiration date ("2021 Share Buyback Plan"). The company completed the 2021 Share Buyback Plan during the first quarter of 2023 and repurchased and retired , and shares in the open market for a total cost of million, billion and million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Shares repurchased pursuant to Corteva's share buyback plans are immediately retired upon repurchase. Repurchased common stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity. The company's accounting policy related to its share repurchases is to reduce its common stock based on the par value of the shares and to reduce its retained earnings for the excess of the repurchase price over the par value. When Corteva has an accumulated deficit balance, the excess over the par value is applied to additional paid-in capital ("APIC"). When Corteva has retained earnings, the excess is charged entirely to retained earnings. 
 
 Noncontrolling Interest 
 Corteva, Inc. owns percent of the outstanding common shares of EIDP. However, EIDP has preferred stock outstanding to third parties which is accounted for as a non-controlling interest in Corteva's interim Consolidated Balance Sheets. Each share of EIDP Preferred Stock - Series and EIDP Preferred Stock - Series issued and outstanding at the effective date of the Corteva Distribution remains issued and outstanding as to EIDP and was unaffected by the Corteva Distribution. 
 
 Below is a summary of the EIDP Preferred Stock at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, which is classified as noncontrolling interests in Corteva's interim Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Derivative Instruments 
 Objectives and Strategies for Holding Derivative Instruments 
 In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to reduce its exposure to foreign currency and commodity price risks. The company has established a variety of derivative programs to be utilized for financial risk management. These programs reflect varying levels of exposure coverage and time horizons based on an assessment of risk. 
 
 Derivative programs have procedures and controls and are approved by the Corporate Financial Risk Management Committee, consistent with the company's financial risk management policies and guidelines. Derivative instruments used are forwards, options, futures and swaps. The company has not designated any non-derivatives as hedging instruments. 
 
 The company's financial risk management procedures also address counterparty credit approval, limits and routine exposure monitoring and reporting. The counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions and major commodity exchanges, and multinational grain exporters. The company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties. The company utilizes collateral support annex agreements with certain counterparties to limit its exposure to credit losses. The company anticipates performance by counterparties to these contracts and therefore no material loss is expected. Market and counterparty credit risks associated with these instruments are regularly reported to management. 
 
 The aggregate notional amounts for the company's derivative instruments (both designated and not designated) was a net buy (sell) position of million, ) million and million at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 The company's objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency rate changes and to mitigate the exposure of certain investments in foreign subsidiaries against changes in the Euro/USD exchange rate. Accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, commitments, investments and cash flows. 
 
 The company uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. The primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes, after related tax effects, are minimized. The company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset a portion of the company s exposure to certain forecasted transactions as well as the translation of foreign currency-denominated earnings. The company also uses commodity contracts to offset risks associated with foreign currency devaluation in certain countries.

 At September 30, 2024, an after-tax net loss of million is expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings over the next twelve months. 
 
 Foreign Currency Contracts 
 The company enters into forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with forecasted transactions within certain foreign subsidiaries. 
 
 While each risk management program has a different time maturity period, most programs currently do not extend beyond the next . Cash flow hedge results are reclassified into earnings during the same period in which the related exposure impacts earnings.

 Derivatives Designated as Net Investment Hedges 
 Foreign Currency Contracts 
 In May 2024, the company designated million of forward contracts to exchange Euro as net investment hedges. An additional tranche of million of forward contracts to exchange Euro were executed in July 2024 and also designated as net investment hedges. The purpose of these forward contracts is to mitigate foreign exchange exposure related to a portion of the company s Euro net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in Euro/USD exchange rates. These hedges will

billion and million of forward contracts to exchange Euro as net investment hedges, which expired and were settled in May 2024 and March 2023, respectively. 
 
 The company elected to apply the spot method in testing for effectiveness of the hedging relationship. 
 
 Derivatives not Designated in Hedging Relationships 
 Foreign Currency Contracts 
 The company uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its net exposure, by currency, related to foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes are minimized. The netting of such exposures precludes the use of hedge accounting; however, the required revaluation of the forward contracts and the associated foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities intends to achieve a minimal earnings impact, after taxes. The company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset a portion of the company s exposure to the translation of certain foreign currency-denominated earnings so that gains and losses on the contracts offset changes in the USD value of the related foreign currency-denominated earnings over the relevant aggregate period. 
 
 Commodity Contracts 
 The company utilizes options, futures and swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments to reduce exposure to commodity price fluctuations on purchases of inventory such as corn and soybeans. The company uses commodity contracts to offset a portion of the company s exposure to commodity price fluctuations so that gains and losses on the contracts offset changes in the commodity price over the relevant aggregate period. The company uses forward agreements, with durations less than one year, to buy and sell USD-priced commodities in order to reduce its exposure to currency devaluation for a portion of its local currency cash balances. Counterparties to the forward sales agreements are multinational grain exporters and subject to the company s financial risk management procedures.

 Recent Developments 
 
 Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program 
 On November 5, 2023, management of the company approved a plan to further optimize its Crop Protection network of manufacturing and external partners (the "Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program"). In October 2024, management of the company amended the Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program to include revisions to its previous estimates and decommissioning and demolition costs associated with the ceasing of operations, primarily at the Pittsburg, California site. 
 
 The company expects to record aggregate pre-tax restructuring and asset related charges of 650 million to 700 million, comprised of 85 million to 105 million of severance and related benefit costs, 320 million to 340 million of asset-related and impairment charges and 245 million to 255 million of costs related to exiting the company s production activities and ceasing operations (which includes related contract terminations and decommissioning and demolition costs). Decommissioning and demolition costs will be expensed on an as-incurred basis. Reductions in workforce are subject to local regulatory requirements. Through the third quarter of 2024, the company recorded net pre-tax restructuring and asset related charges of 372 million, comprised of 60 million of severance and related benefit costs, 309 million of asset-related and impairment charges and 3 million of costs related to contract terminations. 
 
 Cash payments related to these charges are anticipated to be 330 million to 360 million, which primarily relate to the payment of severance and related benefits, contract terminations and decommissioning and demolition. Through the third quarter of 2024, the company paid 10 million associated with these charges. The restructuring actions associated with these charges are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2026. 
 
 The Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program is expected to contribute to the company s ongoing cost and productivity improvement efforts through achieving an estimated 180 million of savings on a run rate basis by 2027. Future actions by the company or changes in circumstances from current assumptions, including any site disposition gains or losses, may cause actual results and future cash payments to differ. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 
 
 2022 Restructuring Actions 
 In connection with the company s shift to a global business unit model during 2022, the company assessed its business priorities and operational structure to maximize the customer experience and deliver on growth and earnings potential. As a result of this assessment, the company committed to restructuring actions during the second quarter of 2022, which included the company s Russia Exit (collectively the 2022 Restructuring Actions ). The company does not anticipate any additional material charges from the 2022 Restructuring Actions as actions associated with this charge are substantially complete. 
 
 The remaining cash payments related to these charges is 36 million, and primarily relate to the payment of severance and related benefits and contract terminations. 
 
 The 2022 Restructuring Actions are expected to contribute to the company s ongoing cost and productivity improvement efforts through achieving an estimated 210 million to 220 million of savings on a run rate basis by 2025. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 Share Buyback Plan 
 On September 13, 2022, Corteva, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized a 2 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value 0.01 per share, without an expiration date ("2022 Share Buyback Plan"). The timing, price and volume of purchases will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws and other factors. In connection with the 2022 Share Buyback Plan, the company repurchased and retired 4,722,000 shares and 4,913,000 shares in the open market for a total cost (excluding excise taxes) of 250 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 13,838,000 shares and 6,330,000 shares in the open market for a total cost (excluding excise taxes) of 750 million and 330 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 42 

Table of Contents 

 Cost of goods sold totaled 1,565 million in the third quarter of 2024, down from 1,646 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by favorable currency effects, ongoing cost and productivity actions and Crop Protection raw material deflation, partially offset by higher Seed commodity and other cost of sales and higher volumes. 
 Restructuring and asset related charges - net were 32 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase from 2 million in the third quarter of 2023.

 Cost of goods sold totaled 7,033 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , down from 7,554 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily driven by volume declines, reduction of royalty expense and ongoing cost and productivity actions, partially offset by higher Seed commodity costs. 
 Restructuring and asset related charges - net were 199 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase from 95 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relate to severance and asset related charges associated with the Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program and non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense related to Roundup Ready 2 Yield and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend herbicide tolerance traits. 
 Income (loss) from continuing operations after income taxes was 913 million, as compared to 1,172 million in the same quarter last year. 
 Operating EBITDA was 2,851 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down from 2,995 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by lower volumes along with competitive Crop Protection pricing and continued investment in Seed research and development, partially offset by Seed pricing gains, the reduction of royalty expense and ongoing cost and productivity actions. Refer to page 51 for further discussion of the company's Non-GAAP financial measures. 
 In addition to the financial highlights above, the following events occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 The company returned approximately 1.1 billion to shareholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 under its previously announced share repurchase programs and through common stock dividends. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales were 2,326 million and 2,590 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by an 8 percent decrease in price and a 5 percent unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by a 3 percent increase in volume. Pricing losses reflect the continued competitive price environment in Crop Protection, particularly in Latin America. Crop Protection volume increased versus the prior year driven primarily by Latin America and North America demand for new products and spinosyns, partially offset by residual destocking and unfavorable weather in EMEA. The Crop Protection volume increase was partially offset by a decline in Seed volumes due to reduced corn planted area in Argentina. Unfavorable currency impacts were driven by the Turkish Lira and the Brazilian Real.

 Net sales were 12,930 million and 13,519 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by a 2 percent decrease in volume and a 2 percent unfavorable impact from currency. Volume declines were driven by reduced corn planted area in Latin America, unfavorable weather, reduced planted area and destocking impacts in EMEA and just-in-time Crop Protection purchasing behavior in North America, partially offset by growth in Latin America on demand for new products and spinosyns. While Seed pricing increased due to the continued execution on the company's price for value strategy as led by North America, this increase was completely offset by a decline in Crop Protection pricing driven by the competitive environment in Latin America.

 Research and Development Expense ("R D") 
 R D expense was 348 million (15 percent of net sales) and 335 million (13 percent of net sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1,037 million (8 percent of net sales) and 980 million (7 percent of net sales) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in R D expense is in support of the company s long-term investment plans and was primarily driven by an increase in salaries due to higher headcount, as well as additional spending on field, lab and facilities, and third-party research costs. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 SG A expenses were 671 million (29 percent of net sales) and 670 million (26 percent of net sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily driven by an increase in certain benefits costs, offset by favorable currency impacts. 
 
 SG A expenses were 2,461 million (19 percent of net sales) and 2,441 million (18 percent of net sales) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in commissions, bad debt expense, litigation and the effects of the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions, partially offset by favorable currency impacts. 
 
 Amortization of Intangibles 
 Intangible asset amortization was 170 million and 174 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As certain intangible assets became fully amortized since the end of the prior year period, amortization expense decreased in the current year period. 
 
 Intangible asset amortization was 521 million and 508 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of amortization relating to the intangible assets recognized in connection with the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions, which were completed on March 1, 2023. 
 
 Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net 
 Restructuring and asset related charges - net were 32 million and 2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 199 million and 95 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The charges in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily related to charges associated with the Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program consisting of severance and related benefit costs and asset related charges. The charges in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily related to costs associated with the 2022 Restructuring Actions. The charges in the third quarter ended September 30, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 also include non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense related to Roundup Ready 2 Yield and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend herbicide tolerance traits. 
 See Note 5 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) - Net 
 Other income (expense) - net was (107) million and (149) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Lower other expense was primarily driven by the absence of charges related to estimated settlement reserves, partially offset by a decrease in both interest income and the gain on sale of businesses and other assets. 
 
 Other income (expense) - net was (319) million and (354) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Lower other expense was primarily driven by a decrease in charges related to estimated settlement reserves and the receipt of an indemnification payment negotiated with the former Stoller owners, partially offset by a decrease in interest income and higher non-operating pension and other post employment benefit costs. 
 
 See Note 6 - Supplementary Information, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 66 million and 58 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 173 million and 171 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily driven by lower short-term borrowings offset by higher interest related to the senior notes issued in 2023 and for foreign currency loans and subsidiary debt effects.

 Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes on Continuing Operations 
 The company s benefit from income taxes on continuing operations was (114) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 on pre-tax loss from continuing operations of (633) million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 18.0 percent. The effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by tax impacts of certain net exchange losses recognized on the re-measurement of the net monetary asset positions which were not tax-deductible in their local jurisdictions. 
 
 The company's benefit from income taxes on continuing operations was (129) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 on pre-tax loss from continuing operations of (444) million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 29.1 percent. The effective tax rate was favorably impacted by 11 million of net tax benefits associated with changes in deferred taxes, accruals for certain prior year tax positions in various jurisdictions, as well as favorable geographic mix of earnings. 
 
 The company s provision for income taxes on continuing operations was 274 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 on pre-tax income from continuing operations of 1,187 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.1 percent. The effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by geographic mix of earnings, as well as withholding taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. primarily from current year earnings. Those unfavorable impacts were partially offset by net tax benefits associated with changes in accruals for certain prior year tax positions. 
 
 The company's provision for income taxes on continuing operations was 244 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 on pre-tax income from continuing operations of 1,416 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 17.2 percent. The effective tax rate was favorably impacted by 79 million of net tax benefits associated with changes in deferred taxes, accruals for certain prior year tax positions in various jurisdictions, stock-based compensation, as well as the impact of changes to deferred taxes associated with a tax currency change for a legal entity. Those favorable impacts were partially offset by the unfavorable tax impacts of certain net exchange losses recognized on the re-measurement of the net monetary asset positions which were not tax-deductible in their local jurisdictions, as well as the tax impact of repatriation. 
 
 Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations After Tax 
 Income (loss) from discontinued operations after tax was (2) million and 45 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The result for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by litigation-related activity. The after-tax benefit recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by charges recognized relating to the MOU with Chemours and DuPont relating to PFAS environmental remediation activities primarily at Chemours' Fayetteville Works facility and litigation-related activity, more than offset by a favorable adjustment of certain prior year tax positions for previously divested businesses and the derecognition of an indemnification liability associated with the Water District Settlement Fund contribution. 
 
 Income (loss) from discontinued operations after tax was (3) million and (174) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily includes charges associated with the settlement of certain legal matters relating to PFAS that are subject to the MOU, including the Nationwide Water District Settlement.

 Corporate Outlook 
 Commodity prices are relatively steady, despite an anticipated record U.S. corn crop, and farmers continue to prioritize top-tier seed technology, while managing tighter margins. Against this backdrop, our Seed business has continued to outperform the market, likely gaining market share while improving operational efficiency. Meanwhile, the Latin America market conditions represent a headwind, including a significant reduction in corn planted area in Argentina. 
 
 While the global Crop Protection industry volumes have continued to stabilize, the pricing environment remains competitive. Third quarter gains in Operating EBITDA, including significant benefits from productivity and raw material deflation, reflect the resilience of our Crop Protection business. 
 
 As a result, for full-year 2024, the company expects net sales in the range of 17.0 billion to 17.2 billion, a decline of 1 percent at the mid-point. Operating EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 3.35 billion to 3.45 billion, growth of 1 percent at the mid-point. Operating Earnings Per Share is expected to be in the range of 2.50 to 2.60 per share, down 5 percent at the mid-point. Cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 2.1 billion to 2.6 billion. Free Cash Flow is expected to be in the range of 1.5 billion to 2.0 billion. Refer to further discussion of Non-GAAP metrics on page 51. 
 
 The above outlook does not contemplate any extreme weather events, operational disruptions, significant changes in customers' demand or ability to pay, or further acceleration of currency and inflation impacts resulting from macro-economic driven trends. Corteva is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, except for Free Cash Flow, to its most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, as it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty items outside of the company s control, such as significant items, without unreasonable effort (refer to page 52 for significant items recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023). However, during 2023 and 2024, the company committed to restructuring activities to optimize the Crop Protection network of manufacturing and external partners, which are expected to be substantially complete in 2026. The company expects to record approximately 345 million to 395 million net pre-tax restructuring charges during 2024 and 2025 for these activities. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

 See Note 2 - Recent Accounting Guidance, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, for a description of recent accounting pronouncements. 

Segment Reviews 
 
 The company operates in two reportable segments: Seed and Crop Protection. 
 
 Seed 
 The company s Seed segment is a global leader in developing and supplying advanced germplasm and traits that produce optimum yield for farms around the world. The segment is a leader in many of the company s key seed markets, including North America corn and soybeans, Europe corn and sunflower, as well as Brazil, India, South Africa and Argentina corn. The segment offers trait technologies that improve resistance to weather, disease, insects, herbicides used to control weeds and enhance food and nutritional characteristics, and digital solutions that assist farmer decision-making to help maximize yield and profitability. 
 
 Crop Protection 
 The Crop Protection segment serves the global agricultural input industry with products that protect against weeds, insects and other pests, and disease, and that improve overall crop health both above and below ground via nitrogen management and seed-applied technologies. The segment offers crop protection solutions and digital solutions that provide farmers the tools they need to improve productivity and profitability, and help keep fields free of weeds, insects and diseases. The segment is a leader in global herbicides, insecticides, nitrogen stabilizers, pasture and range management herbicides and biologicals. 
 
 Summarized below are comments on individual segment net sales and segment operating EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. The company defines segment operating EBITDA as earnings (loss) (i.e., income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, corporate expenses, non-operating benefits (costs), foreign exchange gains (losses), and net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, excluding the impact of significant items. Non-operating benefits (costs) consists of non-operating pension and OPEB credits (costs), tax indemnification adjustments and environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy EIDP businesses and sites. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. See Note 18 - Segment Information, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, for details related to significant pre-tax benefits (charges) excluded from segment operating EBITDA.

 Seed 
 Seed net sales were 691 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 21 percent from 878 million in the third quarter of 2023. The sales decrease was driven by a 12 percent decrease in volume, a 5 percent decrease in price and a 4 percent unfavorable impact from currency. 
 
 The price decline was primarily related to end of season settlement in North America. Lower volumes were due primarily to reduced corn planted area in Argentina. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Brazilian Real. 
 
 Segment operating EBITDA was a loss of 320 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 132 percent from a loss of 138 million in the third quarter of 2023. Higher commodity and other cost of sales, lower volumes, price declines, and continued investment in R D more than offset ongoing cost and productivity actions. 
 
 Seed net sales were 7,773 million in the first nine months of 2024, down 1 percent from 7,837 million in the first nine months of 2023. The sales decrease was driven by a 3 percent decline in volume, a 1 percent unfavorable portfolio impact and a 1 percent unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by a 4 percent increase in price. 
 
 The increase in price was driven by strong demand for top technology offerings and operational execution globally. Pricing actions more than offset currency impacts in EMEA. The decline in volume was driven primarily by reduced corn planted area in Argentina, as well as unfavorable weather and reduced planted area in EMEA. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Turkish Lira and the Brazilian Real. 
 
 Segment operating EBITDA was 2,126 million in the first nine months of 2024, up 8 percent from 1,972 million in the first nine months of 2023. Price execution and market share gains in North America, reduction of net royalty expense, and ongoing cost and productivity actions more than offset lower volumes, the unfavorable impact of currency, investment in R D and higher commodity costs. Segment operating EBITDA margin improved by approximately 220 basis points versus the prior-year period.

 Crop Protection 
 Crop Protection net sales were 1,635 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 4 percent from 1,712 million in the third quarter of 2023. The sales decline over the prior period was driven by a 10 percent decline in price and a 5 percent unfavorable impact from currency, partially offset by an 11 percent increase in volume. 
 
 The increase in volume was driven primarily by Latin America and North America on demand for new products, spinosyns, and biologicals, partially offset by residual destocking in EMEA. The price decline was primarily due to the competitive pricing environment in Latin America. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Brazilian Real.

 Segment Operating EBITDA was 246 million in the third quarter of 2024, up 34 percent from 184 million in the third quarter of 2023. Raw material deflation, productivity savings and volume growth were partially offset by competitive pricing. Segment operating EBITDA margin improved by 430 basis points versus the prior-year period. 
 
 Crop Protection net sales were 5,157 million in the first nine months of 2024, down 9 percent from 5,682 million in the first nine months of 2023. The sales decrease was driven by a 5 percent decline in price, a 3 percent unfavorable impact from currency and a 2 percent decrease in volume. These declines were partially offset by a 1 percent favorable portfolio and other impact. 
 
 The decrease in volume was primarily due to residual destocking and unfavorable weather impacts in EMEA, as well as just-in-time purchasing behavior in North America, partially offset by volume growth in Latin America on demand for new products and spinosyns. The price decline was primarily due to market dynamics in Latin America. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Brazilian Real and the Turkish Lira. The portfolio impact was driven by the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions. 
 
 Segment Operating EBITDA was 811 million in the first nine months of 2024, down 27 percent from 1,107 million in the first nine months of 2023. Pricing pressure, lower volumes, and the unfavorable impact of currency more than offset productivity savings. Segment operating EBITDA margin declined by approximately 375 basis points versus the prior-year period. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The company presents certain financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP and are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures include Operating EBITDA and operating earnings (loss) per share. Management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting, including allocating resources and evaluating incentive compensation. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures best reflect the ongoing performance of the company during the periods presented and provide more relevant and meaningful information to investors as they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company and a more useful comparison of year over year results. These non-GAAP measures supplement the company's U.S. GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, such non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided or used by other companies. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP are provided below. 
 
 Operating EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) (i.e., income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, non-operating benefits (costs), foreign exchange gains (losses), and net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, excluding the impact of significant items. Non-operating benefits (costs) consists of non-operating pension and OPEB credits (costs), tax indemnification adjustments and environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy businesses and sites. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. Operating earnings (loss) per share is defined as "earnings (loss) per common share from continuing operations - diluted" excluding the after-tax impact of significant items, the after-tax impact of non-operating benefits (costs), the after-tax impact of amortization expense associated with intangible assets existing as of the Separation from DowDuPont, and the after-tax impact of net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Although amortization of the company's intangible assets is excluded from these non-GAAP measures, management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in amortization of additional intangible assets. Net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting represents the non-cash net gain (loss) from changes in fair value of certain undesignated foreign currency derivative contracts. Upon settlement, which is within the same calendar year of execution of the contract, the realized gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the non-qualified foreign currency derivative contracts will be reported in the relevant non-GAAP financial measures, allowing quarterly results to reflect the economic effects of the foreign currency derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility. 
 
 The company also uses Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to evaluate and discuss its liquidity position and ability to generate cash. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash provided by (used for) operating activities continuing operations, less capital expenditures. Management believes that Free Cash Flow provides investors with meaningful information regarding the 
 company s ongoing ability to generate cash through core operations, and the company s ability to service its indebtedness, pay dividends (when declared), make share repurchases, and meet its ongoing cash needs for its operations. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the company made the decision, which was retrospectively applied, to adjust the presentation of the

Table of Contents 

 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to separately show the cash provided by (used for) operating activities discontinued operations, which was previously presented within cash provided by (used for) operating activities. See Note 1 Background and Basis of Presentation, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. As a result, the definition for Free Cash Flow was revised to utilize cash provided by (used for) operating activities continuing operations. The change in definition did not have a material impact to prior years Free Cash Flow. Management made this decision to better present the liquidity generated from the company s ongoing business operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Information related to the company's liquidity and capital resources can be found in the company s 2023 Annual Report, Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity Capital Resources. The discussion below provides the updates to this information for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 (In millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 2,493 2,742 2,362 Total debt 5,716 2,489 5,899 
 The increase in debt balances from December 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher short-term debt, which was used to fund the company's working capital needs, capital spending, dividend payments and share repurchases. See further information in Note 12 - Short-Term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets and commercial paper markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund its operations, including seasonal working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases, pension obligations and litigation costs, net of recoveries. Corteva's strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings will provide access as needed to capital markets and commercial paper markets to fund seasonal working capital needs. The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, long-term debt markets, bank financing and committed receivable repurchase facilities. Corteva considers the borrowing costs and lending terms when selecting the source to fund its operations and working capital needs. 
 
 The company had access to approximately 6.2 billion, 6.0 billion, 6.0 billion at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, in committed and uncommitted unused credit lines, which includes the uncommitted revolving credit lines relating to the Foreign Currency Loans. These facilities provide support to meet the company s short-term liquidity needs and for general corporate purposes, which may include funding of discretionary and non-discretionary contributions to certain benefit plans, severance payments, repayment and refinancing of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases and redemptions of securities, acquisitions and Corteva's costs and expenses, including the settlement of litigation. These facilities are provided to the company by highly rated and well capitalized global financial institutions.

Table of Contents 

In June 2024, the Revolving Credit Facilities were refinanced for purposes of extending the maturity dates for the five-year and three-year revolving credit facilities to June 2029 and June 2027, respectively, and lowering the facility amount of the five-year revolving credit facility to 2.85 billion and the three-year revolving credit facility to 1.9 billion. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities will have an interest rate equal to Adjusted Term SOFR, which is Term SOFR plus 0.10 percent, plus the applicable margin. The Revolving Credit Facilities may serve as a substitute to the company's commercial paper program, and can be used, from time to time, for general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, the funding of seasonal working capital needs. The Revolving Credit Facilities contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are typical for companies with similar credit ratings. Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facilities contain a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization for Corteva and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.60. At September 30, 2024, the company was in compliance with these covenants. 
 
 In February 2024, the company amended and restated its July 2023 (as amended in July 2023 and January 2024) 364-day revolving credit agreement (the 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility increasing the facility amount to 1 billion and extending the expiration date to February 2025. In February 2023, the company drew down 1 billion under the 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility, which was used for general corporate purposes, including funding seasonal working capital needs, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases and to partially fund the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions. See Note 3 - Business Combinations, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions. In May 2023, the company repaid the 1 billion loan using the proceeds from the May 2023 Debt Offering. 
 
 In May 2023, the company issued 600 million of 4.50 percent Senior Notes due in 2026 and 600 million of 4.80 percent Senior Notes due in 2033 (the May 2023 Debt Offering ). 
 
 The company's indenture covenants include customary limitations on liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and mergers and consolidations affecting manufacturing plants, mineral producing properties or research facilities located in the U.S. and the consolidated subsidiaries owning such plants, properties and facilities subject to certain limitations. The outstanding long-term debt also contains customary default provisions. 
 
 The company has meaningful seasonal working capital needs based in part on providing financing to its customers. Working capital is funded through multiple methods including cash, commercial paper, the Revolving Credit Facilities, the 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility, and factoring. 
 
 The company has factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell its trade receivables under both recourse and non-recourse agreements in exchange for cash proceeds in an effort to reduce its receivables risk. For arrangements that include an element of recourse, the company provides a guarantee of the trade receivables in the event of customer default. Refer to Note 9 - Accounts and Notes Receivable - Net, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information. 
 
 The company also organizes agreements with third-party financial institutions who directly provide financing for select customers of the company's Seed and Crop Protection products in each region. Terms of the third-party loans are less than a year and programs are renewed on an annual basis. In some cases, the company guarantees a portion of the extension of such credit to such customers. Refer to Note 13 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information on the company s guarantees. 
 
 The company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 are 2.5 billion, 2.7 billion and 2.4 billion, respectively, of which 2.1 billion, 2.2 billion and 2.0 billion at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively, was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are concentrated subject to local restrictions with highly rated and well capitalized global financial institutions. The underlying credit worthiness and exposures to these counterparties are monitored on a regular basis in line with the company s overall risk management procedures. Upon actual repatriation, such earnings could be subject to withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes, and taxes resulting from the impact of foreign currency movements. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. At September 30, 2024, management believed that sufficient liquidity is available in the U.S. with global operating cash flows, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities, and access to capital markets and commercial paper markets.

 Summary of Cash Flows 
 Cash provided by (used for) operating activities - continuing operations was (1,871) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (2,574) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily driven by favorable changes in working capital. Within accounts payable, lower payments to third-party growers resulted from lower commodity costs and production plans, supplemented by a change in inventory purchasing patterns. The favorable changes in inventories were driven by production reductions to match demand, and favorable changes in other assets and liabilities were primarily due to lower variable compensation payments compared to the prior year and favorable foreign currency derivative contract settlements. These movements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in receivables driven by slower collections, as well as in deferred revenue due to lower prepayments received combined with higher usage of prepayments. 
 
 Cash provided by (used for) operating activities - discontinued operations was (157) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (30) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash outflows were primarily related to PFAS activities that are subject to the MOU with Chemours and DuPont associated with environmental remediation activities primarily at Chemours Fayetteville Works facility. In addition, the disbursement of the cash held in the Water District Settlement Fund is reflected in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash provided by (used for) investing activities was (466) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (1,773) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to the acquisitions of Stoller and Symborg in 2023, partially offset by higher proceeds from the net investment hedge settlement in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the second quarter of 2024, along with higher 2024 activity in investments. 
 
 Cash provided by (used for) financing activities was 2,137 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3,603 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to higher borrowings in 2023 to fund working capital needs, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases and to partially fund the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions, as well as higher payments on debt and higher repurchases of common stock in 2024. 
 
 In January 2024, the company's Board of Directors authorized a common stock dividend of 0.16 per share, payable on March 15, 2024, to the shareholders of record on March 1, 2024. In April 2024, the company's Board of Directors authorized a common stock dividend of 0.16 per share, payable on June 18, 2024, to the shareholders of record on June 4, 2024. In July 2024, the company's Board of Directors authorized a common stock dividend of 0.17 per share, which reflects an approved increase of 6.25 percent, payable on September 17, 2024, to the shareholders of record on September 3, 2024. In October 2024, the company's Board of Directors authorized a common stock dividend of 0.17 per share, payable on December 16, 2024, to the shareholders of recorded on December 2, 2024. 
 
 On September 13, 2022, Corteva, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized a 2 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value 0.01 per share, without an expiration date ("2022 Share Buyback Plan"). The timing, price and volume of purchases in connection with the 2022 Share Buyback Plan will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws and other factors. In connection with the 2022 Share Buyback Plan, the company repurchased and retired 4,722,000 shares and 4,913,000 shares in the open market for a total cost (excluding excise taxes) of 250 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 13,838,000 shares and 6,330,000 shares in the open market for a cost (excluding excise taxes) of 750 million and 330 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. In addition, the company repurchased and retired 4,098,000 shares in the open market for a total cost of 250 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 under the 1.5 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value 0.01 per share, without an expiration date ("2021 Share Buyback Plan"), which was authorized by the Corteva, Inc.

 EIDP s cash provided by (used for) operating activities - continuing operations was (2,977) million and (2,585) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Cash provided by (used for) operating activities - discontinued operations 
 EIDP s cash provided by (used for) operating activities - discontinued operations was (157) million and (30) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily driven by the items noted on page 55, under the header "Summary of Cash Flows."

 EIDP s cash provided by (used for) financing activities was 3,243 million and 3,614 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 The company is subject to various legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, product liability, intellectual property, antitrust, commercial, property damage, personal injury, environmental and regulatory matters arising out of the normal course of its current businesses or legacy EIDP businesses unrelated to Corteva s current businesses but allocated to Corteva as part of the Separation of Corteva from DuPont. 
 
 Often these proceedings raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant amounts of senior leadership team s time. Litigation and other claims, along with regulatory proceedings, against the company could also materially adversely affect its operations, reputation, and/or result in the incurrence of unexpected expenses and liability. Even when the company believes liabilities are not expected to be material or the probability of loss or of an adverse unappealable final judgment is remote, the company may consider settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the company, including avoidance of future distraction and litigation defense cost, and its shareholders. Information regarding certain of these matters is set forth below and in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Litigation related to Corteva s current businesses 
 Federal Trade Commission Investigation 
 On September 29, 2022, the FTC, along with ten state attorneys general, filed a lawsuit against Corteva and another competitor alleging the parties engaged in unfair methods of competition, unlawful conditioning of payments, unreasonably restrained trade, and have an unlawful monopoly (the FTC lawsuit ). In December 2022, two additional state attorneys general joined the FTC lawsuit, and another state attorney general filed a separate lawsuit against Corteva and another competitor based on the allegations set forth in the FTC lawsuit. Several proposed private class action lawsuits alleging anticompetitive conduct based on the allegations set forth in the FTC lawsuit were centralized into a multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina in February 2023. Further information with respect to these proceedings is set forth under Federal Trade Commission Investigation in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Lorsban Lawsuits 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were pending personal injury and remediation lawsuits filed against the former Dow Agrosciences LLC in California alleging injuries related to exposure to, or contamination by, chlorpyrifos, the active ingredient in Lorsban , an insecticide used by commercial farms for field fruit, nut and vegetable crops. Corteva ended its production of Lorsban in 2020. Further information with respect to these proceedings is set forth under Lorsban Lawsuits in Note 13 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Inari Disputes 
 On September 27, 2023, Corteva filed a lawsuit in Delaware federal court against Inari Agriculture, Inc. and Inari Agriculture N.V. (collectively Inari asserting claims of Plant Variety Protection infringement, indirect patent infringement, breach of contract, and civil conversion. Corteva s lawsuit alleges Inari illegally obtained various varieties of seed technologies from a seed depository and illegally transported them abroad for the purpose of performing gene editing on the technologies and then filing a patent for such technologies. Inari s motion to dismiss the complaint was denied in August 2024 and discovery remains ongoing. Since the denial, Inari has asserted counterclaims alleging, among other things, that the patents underlying Corteva's infringement claims are invalid and unenforceable. 
 
 Inari filed a Petition for Post Grant Review (PGR) of Corteva s 055 patent before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board PTAB at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The patent subject to the PGR is related to Enlist E3 soybeans and directed to AAD-12 transformed plants that express AAD-12 enzymes with the dual ability to degrade two classes of herbicides, phenoxy auxins and pyridyloxy auxins. On October 10, 2024, the PTAB found all claims of Corteva s 055 patent unpatentable for lack of enablement. The PTAB decision is not expected to impact our ability to license and protect Enlist E3 traits. Nevertheless, Corteva is evaluating an appeal of the PTAB decision. 
 
 Bayer Disputes 
 In August 2022, Corteva filed a lawsuit against Bayer CropScience LLP and Monsanto Company (collectively Bayer in federal court in Delaware for alleged infringement of Corteva s patented AAD-1 herbicide resistance technology used in Enlist corn. The complaint for this lawsuit was amended to include additional patents that are closely related to this patented technology for soybeans. Corteva seeks to enjoin Bayer from continuing to infringe, as well as appropriate monetary damages. 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 Bayer has filed an answer to the complaint and has asserted various affirmative defenses including invalidity. In August 2023, the court issued a decision adopting Corteva s claim construction for all five disputed patent terms subject to this litigation. 
 
 In December 2023, the PTAB authorized an Inter Partes Review IPR proceeding initiated by Bayer to review the patentability of three patents subject to the AAD-1 litigation. Inari is seeking to join the IPR proceeding. An oral hearing will occur before the PTAB in September 2024 with decisions expected by December 2024. Corteva holds numerous additional patents covering its Enlist traits or Enlist weed control system. Therefore, the IPR process is not expected to impact our ability to license and protect Enlist E3 traits. Corteva's AAD-1 lawsuit is stayed during pendency of the IPR. 
 
 In October 2023, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted an ex parte reexamination of the patent for AAD-1 herbicide resistance technology used in Enlist corn based upon Inari s petition for review. Inari alleges the AAD-1 patent is not patentably distinct from another Corteva patent for maize technology, and therefore not valid unless Corteva files a terminal disclaimer giving up its patent term adjustment for the AAD-1 technology, which would result in the AAD-1 patent expiring in May 2025. 
 
 In August 2022, Bayer filed breach of contract/declaratory judgment lawsuit in Delaware state court against Corteva relating to an agrobacterium cross-license agreement and E3 soybeans. Bayer alleges that Corteva practiced two Bayer patents in developing E3 soybeans, and therefore, is entitled to royalties pursuant to the terms of the cross-license agreement. Further information with respect to these proceedings is set forth under Bayer Dispute in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 In October 2022, Corteva filed a lawsuit against Bayer in Delaware state court seeking a declaration that, under the terms of Corteva s licensing agreement and the law, Bayer is not entitled to collect patent royalties on the Roundup Ready Corn 2 trait after Bayer s U.S. patent protection expires. In September 2024, the court granted Bayer s motion for summary judgement, while denying Corteva's summary judgment motion. Corteva filed notice of its appeal in October 2024 and expects a decision on its appeal around mid-2025. 
 
 Litigation related to legacy EIDP businesses unrelated to Corteva s current businesses 
 As discussed below and in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, certain of the environmental proceedings and litigation allocated to Corteva as part of the Separation from DuPont relate to the legacy EIDP businesses, including their use of PFOA, which, for purposes of this report, means collectively perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt and does not distinguish between the two forms, and PFAS, which means per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, including PFOA, PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid), GenX and other perfluorinated chemicals and compounds ("PFCs"). This litigation includes multiple natural resource damage lawsuits across the United States filed by municipalities and alleging PFOA contamination, as well as, lawsuits by four municipalities in the Netherlands filed complaints alleging contamination of land and groundwater resulting from the emission of PFOA and GenX by Corteva, DuPont and Chemours. 
 
 In addition to the matters set forth in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, on March 25, 2019, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection NJDEP issued a Statewide PFAS Directive to several companies, including Chemours, DuPont, and EIDP. The Directive seeks information relating to the use and environmental release of PFAS and PFAS-replacement chemicals at and from two former EIDP sites in New Jersey, Chambers Works and Parlin, and a funding source for costs related to the NJDEP s investigation of PFAS issues and PFAS testing and remediation. 
 
 On January 22, 2021, Chemours, DuPont, Corteva and EIDP entered into a binding memorandum of understanding containing a settlement to resolve legal disputes related to Chemours' responsibility for litigation and environmental liabilities allocated to it, and to establish a cost sharing arrangement and escrow account to be used to support and manage potential future legacy PFAS liabilities arising out of pre-July 1, 2015 conduct (the MOU ). See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion. 
 
 Other Environmental Proceedings 
 The company believes it is remote that the following matters will have a material impact on its financial position, liquidity or results of operations. The matters below involve the potential for 1 million or more in monetary fines and are included per Item 103(3)(c)(iii) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

 In 2016, the EPA conducted a focused compliance investigation at the Denka Performance Elastomer LLC Denka neoprene manufacturing facility in La Place, Louisiana. EIDP sold the neoprene business, including this manufacturing facility, to Denka in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the spring of 2017, the EPA, the DOJ, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, EIDP and Denka began discussions relating to the inspection conclusions and allegations of noncompliance arising under the Clean Air Act, including leak detection and repair. These discussions, which include potential settlement options, continue. Under the Separation Agreement, DuPont is defending and indemnifying the company in this matter. 
 
 New Jersey Directive Pompton Lakes 
 On March 27, 2019, the NJDEP issued to Chemours and EIDP a Natural Resource Damages Directive relating to chemical contamination (non-PFAS) at and around EIDP s former Pompton Lakes facility in New Jersey. The Directive alleges that this contamination has harmed the natural resources of New Jersey. It seeks 125,000 as reimbursement for the cost of preparing a natural resource damages assessment, which the State will use to determine the extent of such damage and the amount it expects to seek to restore the affected natural resources to their pre-damage state.
