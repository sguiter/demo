million.
During the period between September 18, 2024, through to September 30, 2024, the Company raised approximately (net of commission)
through the sale and issuance of shares of Company common stock
pursuant to the ATM Agreement. A ny sale of shares pursuant to the ATM Agreement
are made under the Company s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-264218), which became
effective on April 20, 2022, and included base prospectus, and under the related prospectus supplement filed with U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the SEC dated September 18, 2024. 

The
Company incurred net losses of (after losses attributable to non-controlling interest) for the three months ended September
30, 2024 (net loss of for the three months ended September 30, 2023). As of September 30, 2024, the Company has shareholders 
equity of , working capital of , and an accumulated deficit of . 

The
Company anticipates operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company does not expect to generate positive cash flows from operating
activities and may continue to incur operating losses until it sufficiently delivers on its objectives which include completion of the
regulatory approval process in the United States of America (US) and other markets where such approval may be required, expansion of
its revenue base into target markets, and the continued development of its products. The ability to achieve these objectives is subject
to inherent risks and no assurance can be provided that these objectives will be fully achieved within the next 12 months. 

The
Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise a substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as going concern within one year after the date of release of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements. Management believes there is material risk that the Company s cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024,
of approximately 
million, may be insufficient to fund its current operating plan through at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company may be required to raise additional funds during the
next 12 months. However, there can be no assurance that when the Company requires additional financing, such financing will be
available on terms which are favorable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional funding to meet its
working capital needs in the future, it will be forced to delay or reduce the scope of its research programs and/or limit or cease
its operations. In addition, the Company may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of
business. 

Accordingly,
these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern unless it can successfully meet
the stated objectives and/or raise additional capital. 

The
Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

million upon the achievement of certain milestones until March 28, 2024 (extended
to March 28, 2025 on April 16, 2024). Proceeds from the grant will be used primarily to reimburse the Company for costs incurred in the
construction of the manufacturing facility. 

Accounting
for the grant does not fall under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , as the Australian Government will not benefit
directly from our manufacturing facility. As there is no authoritative guidance under US GAAP on accounting for grants to for-profit
business entities, we applied International Accounting Standards IAS 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure
of Government Assistance , by analogy when accounting for the Australian Government grant to the Company. Furthermore, disclosures
made below are in accordance with the disclosure requirements of Accounting Standards Update ASU 2021-10, Government
Assistance (Topic 832), Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance . 

The
Australian Government grant proceeds, which will be used to reimburse construction costs incurred, meet the definition of grants related
to assets as the primary purpose for the payments is to fund the construction of a capital asset. Pursuant to IAS 20, the Company has
elected to record the grants received initially as deferred income and deduct the grant proceeds received from the gross costs of the
assets or construction in progress CIP and the deferred grant income liability. A total of and was
recognized as a reduction to the CIP asset on the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 

After
initial recognition, under IAS 20, government grants are recognized in earnings on a systematic basis in a manner that mirrors the manner
in which the Company recognizes the underlying costs for which the grant is intended to compensate. Pursuant to IS 20, the Company has
elected to recognize government grant income separately within other income for operating expenditures. Similarly, for capital expenditures,
the carrying amount of assets purchased or constructed out of the grant funds are presented net by deducting the grant proceeds received
from the gross costs of the assets or CIP and deferred grant income liability. A total of and deferred grant income was
recognized within other income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

b)
R D tax refund 

The
Company measures the R D grant income and receivable by considering the time spent by employees on eligible R D activities and
R D costs incurred to external service providers. The R D tax refund receivable is recognized when it is probable that the amount
will be recovered in full through a future claim. A total of and of R D tax refund income was recognized in other
income during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You
should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024 and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024,
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions
that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors. Actual results could differ materially because of the factors discussed
below or elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2024 Form 10-K. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To
supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP, we present contribution
margin and contribution margin , which are non-GAAP financial measures. Contribution margin and contribution margin
 are presented in the section titled Contribution Margin (non-GAAP) . We have also included reconciliations
of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 

These
non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information
prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other
companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of contribution and contribution margin is provided
for year-over-year comparison purposes. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information
about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary
independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our
business. 

Forward-Looking
Information 

All

Overview 

Intelligent Bio Solutions Inc. and its wholly owned
Delaware subsidiary, GBS Operations Inc., were each formed on December 5, 2016, under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company s
Australian subsidiary, Intelligent Bio Solutions (APAC) Pty Ltd, was formed on August 4, 2016, under the laws of New South Wales, Australia
and was renamed to Intelligent Bio Solutions (APAC) Pty Ltd on January 6, 2023. On October 4, 2022, INBS acquired Intelligent Fingerprinting
Limited IFP ), a company registered in England and Wales. The Company s headquarters are in New York, New York. 

Intelligent Bio Solutions Inc. is a medical technology company focused
on developing and delivering intelligent, rapid, non-invasive testing and screening solutions. The Company operates globally with the
objective of providing innovative and accessible solutions that improve the quality of life. 

21 

The
Company s current product portfolio includes: 

Intelligent
 Fingerprinting Platform: A proprietary portable platform that analyzes fingerprint sweat using a one-time cartridge and portable
 handheld reader. The flagship product from this platform, which is commercially available in certain countries outside of the United
 States, is the Intelligent Fingerprinting Drug Screening System (the IFP System or IFP Products ), a two-part
 system that consists of non-invasive, fingerprint sweat-based diagnostic testing products designed to detect drugs of abuse including
 opiates, cocaine, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabis, methadone, and buprenorphine. The system comprises a small, tamper-evident
 drug screening cartridge onto which ten fingerprint sweat samples are collected in under a minute before the portable analysis unit
 provides an on-screen result in under ten minutes. Samples collected with a confirmatory kit can also be sent to a third-party laboratory
 service provider for confirmation testing. Customers include safety-critical industries such as construction, transportation and
 logistics, manufacturing, engineering, drug treatment organizations in the rehabilitation sector, and judicial organizations. 

The
 Biosensor Platform A biosensor platform we refer to as the Biosensor Platform Technology BPT ), or simply
 the Biosensor Platform, consists of a small, printable modified organic thin-film transistor strip that we license
 across the Asia Pacific Region APAC Region from Life Science Biosensor Diagnostics Pty Ltd LSBD or
 Licensor ). The Biosensor Platform is designed to detect multiple biological analytes by substituting the top enzyme
 layer of the biosensor to suit each analyte. This platform technology has the potential to develop a range of Point of Care Tests
 POCT ), including the modalities of clinical chemistry, immunology, tumor markers, allergens, and endocrinology. We
 understand that following the appointment of a liquidator to LSBD, the intellectual property rights licensed by us from the Licensor
 (LSBD) have reverted to the University of Newcastle. The Company is in early-stage discussions regarding the potential restructuring
 of future licensing of BPT and products with the University of Newcastle. A timeline for these discussions has not yet been established.

Revenue 

Sales
of goods 

Revenue
from sales of goods increased by 76,193 to 872,287 from 796,094 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to same period
in 2023. This is due to the expansion of the customer base, both in the pre-existing markets and expansion into new regions. We expect
this trend to continue as we expand into new markets in the future. 

Revenue
from the IFPG segment relates to the sale of readers, cartridges and other sales which represents accessories and is summarized as follows:

of revenue 

Cost of revenue decreased by 38,277 to 525,486 from
 563,763 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to same period in 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue is mainly due
to decrease in direct labor direct overhead cost. The cost of revenue relates to direct labor, direct material costs and direct overhead
costs incurred in the production of the goods. The following table shows the composition of cost of revenue.

ended September 30, 2024, compared to same period in 2023. This has been driven by increased revenue from acquiring new customers, improved
production capacity and decrease in direct labor and direct overhead cost.

Government
support income 

Government
support income increased by 16,257 to 126,128 from 109,871 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to same period in 2023.
This increase was primarily attributable to amounts spent on qualifying research and development expenditure for research and development
government subsidies. 

The
grant support income is primarily attributable to INBS s subsidiary companies recognizing an R D tax refund as the Company
believes that it is probable that the amount will be recovered in full through a future claim (see Note 3 to our condensed
consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information and disclosures
relating to R D tax refund). 

Operating
expenses 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses decreased by 508,044 to 1,949,016 from 2,457,060 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in legal, insurance, consultancy and other general
overhead costs. 

24 

Development
and regulatory expenses 

Development
and regulatory expenses increased by 844,805 to 948,752 from 103,947 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same
period in 2023. 

This
increase is primarily driven by the amounts spent on in-house R D staff and timing of R D work performed by the research partners.
During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company partnered with CenExel, a nationwide clinical research site network, to perform
a method comparison clinical study as part of the Company s FDA 510(k) clinical study plan. 

As
the Company continues its FDA 501(k) clinical study plan, we expect development and regulatory expenses to increase in future periods. 

Depreciation
and amortization 

Depreciation
and amortization decreased by 7,138 to 300,422 from 307,560 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to same period in 2023.
This decrease is mainly due to favorable exchange rate for conversion of the account balances. 

Other
income and expenses 

Interest
expense 

Interest
expense decreased by 15,121 to 22,327 from 37,448 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.
This decrease was attributable to the reduction of interest expense recorded for leased assets and notes payable. 

Fair
value gain on revaluation of financial instruments 

The
fair value gain on revaluation of financial instruments decreased by 131,250 to 0 from 131,250 for the three months ended September 30,
2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is due to the revaluation gain on contingent consideration for holdback Series
C Preferred Stock resulting from the acquisition of IFP. The holdback Series C Preferred Stock shares were converted into common stock
in October 2023. 

Interest income 

Interest income increased by 52,701 to 52,840 from 139 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to the same period in 2023. This increase was attributable to funds received from capital raising activities, which contributed to the
balance on which interest was earned. 

Income
tax (expense) benefit 

There
was no income tax expense for both the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, as the Company has established
a full valuation allowance for all its deferred tax assets. 

Other
comprehensive income 

Foreign
currency translation gain / (loss) 

Unrealized
foreign currency translation gain increased by 234,371 to a gain of 216,355 from a loss of 18,016 for the three months ended September
30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This is due to the favorable exchange rate calculated based on the Company s unsettled transactions in currencies other
than its functional currency and translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries in reporting currency. 

Net
loss attributable to INBS 

Net loss attributable to the Company increased by 260,429 to 2,685,633
from 2,425,204 for the months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This increase is primarily driven
by the Company s investment in R D work required for its FDA 510(k) clinical study plan and planned submission in the
fourth quarter of this calendar year. FDA clearance would enable INBS to introduce its drug screening technology to the United States
market in the 2025 calendar year. 

25 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
use working capital and cash measures to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations.
We define Working Capital as current assets less current liabilities. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for any standardized measure under US GAAP. This information is intended to provide investors with information about our liquidity. Other
companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

Since
our inception, our operations have primarily been financed through the issuance of our common stock, redeemable convertible preferred
stock, and the incurrence of debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had 3,989,431 in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of 800,112. 

On September 18, 2024, the Company entered into an
At The Market Offering Agreement (the ATM Agreement) with Ladenburg. Pursuant to the terms of the ATM Agreement, the Company may sell
from time to time through Ladenburg, as sales agent and/or principal, shares of the Company s common stock with an aggregate sales
price of up to 3.0 million. During the period between September 18, 2024, through to September 30, 2024, the Company raised approximately
 34,511 (net of commission) through the sale and issuance of 17,167 shares of Company common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement. A ny
sale of shares pursuant to the ATM Agreement are made under the Company s effective shelf registration statement on
Form S-3 (File No. 333-264218), which became effective on April 20, 2022, and included base prospectus, and under the related prospectus
supplement filed with SEC dated September 18, 2024. 

The Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents
as of September 30, 2024, may be insufficient to allow the Company to fund its current operating plan through at least the next twelve
months from the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date these unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements are issued. There can be no assurance that, in the event that the Company requires additional financing, such financing
may be available on terms which are favorable to us, or at all. 

In
the event we require additional capital, there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise such capital on acceptable terms, or
at all. Failure to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital through debt or equity financings, or through collaboration
agreements, strategic alliances or marketing and distribution arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet
our long-term liquidity needs and achieve our intended long-term business plan. Our failure to obtain such funding when needed could
create a negative impact on our stock price or could potentially lead to a reduction in our operations or the failure of our Company.
Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern unless it can successfully
raise additional capital. 

As of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

Extended
Transition Period for Emerging Growth Companies 

We
have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of
the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates
for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Because our financial statements may not be comparable
to companies that comply with public company effective dates, investors may have difficulty evaluating or comparing our business, performance
or prospects in comparison to other public companies, which may have a negative impact on the value and liquidity of our common stock. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that are not readily apparent
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

26 

The
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period
in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the
revision affects both current and future periods. 

A
summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 3 Summary of significant accounting policies to the
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting policies are considered critical, as
these policies require significant, difficult or complex judgments by management, often requiring the use of estimates about the
effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical policies are summarized in Item 7. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2024. 

Recently
issued Accounting Pronouncements 

For
the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements,

and incorporated herein by reference. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

Based
on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective due to the material weakness in internal
control over financial reporting discussed below. 

Notwithstanding
this conclusion, we believe that our consolidated financial statements and other information contained in this quarterly report on Form
10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our business, financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. 

Material Weakness 

In
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, management identified material
weaknesses in control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication and monitoring. Specifically, the
material weaknesses identified relate to the fact that the Company has not yet designed and maintained an effective control environment
commensurate with its financial reporting requirements, including (a) has not yet completed formally documenting policies and procedures
with respect to review, supervision and monitoring of the Company s accounting and reporting functions, (b) lack of evidence to
support the performance of controls and the adequacy of review procedures, including the completeness and accuracy of information used
in the performance of controls and (c) we have limited accounting personnel and other supervisory resources necessary to adequately execute
the Company s accounting processes and address its internal controls over financial reporting. 

27 

Ongoing
Remediation Plan 

Management
is committed to continuing the steps necessary to remediate the control deficiencies that constituted the above material weaknesses.
Since our initial public offering IPO ), which we completed in December 2020, we made the following enhancements and continue
to make progress to enhance our control environment: 

We added accounting and finance personnel to provide additional individuals to allow for segregation of duties in the preparation and
review of schedules, calculations and journal entries that support financial reporting, to provide oversight, structure and reporting
lines to provide additional review over our disclosures; 

We enhanced our controls to improve the preparation and review of complex accounting measurements, the application of US GAAP to significant
accounts and transactions and our financial statement disclosures; 

We engage independent experts when complex transactions are entered into; 

We have recruited and plan to recruit additional financial reporting and accounting personnel with adequate knowledge of US GAAP and
SEC rules; and 

We are in the process of engaging outside consultants to assist us in our evaluation of the design, implementation and documentation
of internal controls that address the relevant risks, to provide appropriate evidence of performance of our internal controls (including
completeness and accuracy procedures). 

Under
the direction of the Audit Committee of our board of directors, management will continue to take measures to remediate the material weaknesses.
As such, we will continue to enhance corporate oversight over process-level controls and structures to ensure that there is an appropriate
assignment of authority, responsibility and accountability to enable remediation of our material weakness. 

As
we continue to evaluate, and work to improve, our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine that additional
measures to address control deficiencies or modifications to the remediation plan are necessary. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Other
than the ongoing remediation effort, described above, there have been no changes to the Company s internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls 

A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the internal control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. 

28 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently engaged
in any material legal proceedings. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 18, 2024, except for risks described below. Any of those risk factors could result in a
significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known
to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors
or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

We
may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations in the future. If we are unsuccessful in attracting new capital, we may not
be able to continue operations or may be forced to sell assets to do so. Alternatively, capital may not be available to us on favorable
terms, or at all. If available, financing terms may lead to significant dilution of our stockholders equity. 

We
are not profitable and have had negative cash flow from operations since our inception. To fund our operations and to develop and
commercialize our products (including the BPT and planned applications of IFP Drug Screening System), we have relied primarily on
equity and some debt financing and government support income. The Company believes there is material risk that its cash and cash
equivalents as of September 30, 2024, of 3,989,431 may be insufficient to allow the Company to fund its current operating plan
through at least the next twelve months from the issuance of its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the
fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least one year from the date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were
issued. Accordingly, the Company may be required to raise additional funds during the next 12 months. However, there can be no
assurance that when the Company requires additional financing, such financing will be available on terms which are favorable to the
Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional funding to meet its working capital needs in the future, it will be
forced to delay or reduce the scope of its research programs and/or limit or cease its operations. In addition, the Company may be
unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. 

To
obtain the additional capital necessary to fund our operations, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity
offerings, debt financing and/or other capital sources. Even if capital is available, it might be available only on unfavorable terms.
Any additional equity or convertible debt financing into which we enter could be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Any future debt
financing into which we enter may impose covenants upon us that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur
liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or
asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our
stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may need to relinquish
rights to our technologies or our products or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If access to sufficient capital is
not available as and when needed, our business will be materially impaired and we may be required to cease operations, curtail one or
more product development or commercialization programs, scale back or eliminate the development of business opportunities, or significantly
reduce expenses, sell assets, seek a merger or joint venture partner, file for protection from creditors or liquidate all of our assets.
Any of these factors could harm our operating results.

If
we are unable to achieve certain agreed milestones for the government grant, we received, we may become liable to refund the grant we
received. The Company has only completed 4 of the 8 agreed milestones set forth in the Company s grant agreement with the Australian
Government. 

On
April 16, 2024, the Australian Government Department of Industry, Science and Resources provided an extension to complete the project
by March 28, 2025, with certain modification in project costs. If we are unable to achieve the agreed milestones by the extended date,
we may become liable to refund the grant we received .
