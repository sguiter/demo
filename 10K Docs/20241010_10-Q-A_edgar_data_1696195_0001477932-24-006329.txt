F-7 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies F-8 Table of Contents Income Tax Provision . The estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Board of Directors maintains a tax committee to review all tax issues and make recommendations to management concerning tax matters. In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary. F-9 Table of Contents Earnings per Share Cash Flows Reporting F-10 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and stockholder equity of US ). In early May 2024 our new external accounting advisors questioned a specific entry in the Balance Sheet that was posted in June 2022. The entry was an increase to Accounts Receivable in the amount of Five Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars due from existing shareholders and with the offset going to Addition Paid in Capital. The previous external accountants had originally interpreted a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement executed between shareholders in the second quarter of 2022 as money that the acquiring shareholders owed Kinetic Group. However, upon further review by the new accounting advisors it was discovered that the original SPA did not provide for money to be paid to Kinetic. Accordingly, the Company reversed the entry immediately after the discovery of the error. The error had/has no impact on any current or prior period: income statements, cash flow statements, management or key persons compensation, income statement or cash flow key metrics, current or long-term liabilities, or accumulated retained earnings. Management does not expect this reversal to adversely materially affect the ongoing business of Kinetic and reported this to SEC. Since January 2024 Balance sheet statement include corrections done and revised by our independent CPA. It is Management s responsibility to verify and have in place sufficient and effective controls and procedures to identify an error in the Company s financial statements. Management did not have sufficient controls at the time of the error and have now established an audit committee to verify all information being presented. The Company is attempting to generate sufficient revenue and at the present time, daily operations are being supported by principal stockholders. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to continue operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Forward-Looking Statements and Associated Risks . The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements contained in the MD A are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our Business Kinetic Group Inc., a Nevada corporation, was formed under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 6, 2014. Kinetic Group is a technology holding company, offering digital transformation through AI technology to enterprises looking to improve strategic and operational decision making. KNIT accelerates the digital transformation of companies by converting property, plants and equipment into Smart Assets which enhance productivity. Kinetic Group Inc. is a development stage company as defined by section 915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Although the Company has recognized nominal amounts of revenue, it is still devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business. All losses accumulated since Inception (June 6, 2014) have been considered as part of the Company s development stage activities. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The amendments in this Update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. For public business entities, those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Kinetic Group has elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements. The adoption of this ASU allows the company to remove the inception to date information and all references to development stage. 5 Table of Contents Results of operations for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenue Our gross revenue for the nine-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0 and 0 respectively.
