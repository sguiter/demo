Level 2 

Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for
which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets
or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent
transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally
from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 

Level 3 

Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for
which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets
or liabilities. 

The carrying values of our financial instruments,
including, cash; accounts receivable; deposit for acquisition, prepaid and other current assets; accounts payable; accrued liabilities
and other current liabilities; and due from/to related parties approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of these
financial instruments. 

Transactions involving related parties cannot
be presumed to be carried out on an arm s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not
exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated
on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm s-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated. It is not,
however, practical to determine the fair value of amounts due to related parties due to their related party nature.

we agreed to allow Seller the option to exchange the Promissory Note for shares of iQSTEL. On June 27, 2024, we entered into a second
amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the Amendment that required us to issue an amended and restated promissory note to
the Seller. We had paid down of the note, so the amended and restated promissory note was issued in the principal amount

each of the months of May through November 1,400,000) with a balloon payment of , to monthly installments of plus
interest during 2024, and plus interest during the first 6 months of 2025. We also revised the Earnout Payment
due to the Seller. The Earnout Payment was redefined at net income, to be achieved in Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2024 . The payment
that IQSTEL has to pay upon achievement of the Earnout Payment will be paid during the first half of 2025, in monthly installments.

If the Company issues securities less than the
exercise price of the option, ADI Funding has a right to also use that lesser price in the exercise of its Option. The Option also contains
rights to any Company distributions and consideration in fundamental transactions. 

The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified
or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance
in FASB ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC
815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition
of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including
whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s own common shares and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net
cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This
assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly
period end date while the warrants are outstanding. 

The Company determined that the warrants had
net cash settlement and categorized the warrants as a liability in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

A summary of activity regarding warrants
issued as follows:

Outstanding, September 30, 2024 

The intrinsic value of the warrants as of September

is subject to a beneficial ownership limitation of of the Company s outstanding common stock, which, upon notice,
may be increased to . 

Fair Value Assumptions Used in Accounting
for Derivative Liabilities 

ASC 815 requires we assess the fair market value
of derivative liabilities at the end of each reporting period and recognize any change in the fair market value as other income or expense. 

The Company determined our derivative liabilities
to be a Level 3 fair value measurement and used the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value as of September 30, 2024.
The Black-Scholes model requires six basic data inputs: the exercise or strike price, time to expiration, the risk-free interest rate,
the current stock price, the estimated volatility of the stock price in the future, and the dividend rate. Changes to these inputs could
produce a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. 

As of September 30, 2024, the estimated
fair values of the liabilities measured on a recurring basis are as follows: 

 - years 
 
 Expected average volatility 
 - 
 
 Expected dividend yield 

Risk-free interest rate

On November 1, 2024, we entered into a
binding Memorandum of Understanding (the Agreement with Mr. Ralf Koehler ("Ralf"), SwissLink Carrier Ltd., ("SwissLink")
and Impact Trading Consulting LLC ("Impact") for the purpose of outlining the understanding regarding the exchange of
49 ownership in SwissLink for our shares. Pursuant to the Agreement, the parties agreed that the execution of the final agreement will
be subject to mutual consent and negotiations based on the terms already agreed below: 

The agreed valuation to purchase
Ralf s 49 ownership interest in SwissLink is set at 750,000 USD. 

The term of this agreement will
be for five (5) years plus six (6) months Termination Date ), commencing on the date of the execution of the final agreement
("Final Agreement"). 

Ownership will be transferred
from Ralf to us in tranches, with each tranche comprising up to 10 of ownership per year. 

The option to execute each tranche
can be initiated by Ralf within each one-year period through the submission of a "trigger letter" by e-mail to us. If Ralf does
not exercise his right to trigger the agreement during any year, we reserve the right to initiate the tranche execution at any point thereafter. 

Share Calculation: The number
of iQSTEL shares to be provided in exchange for each tranche will be determined based on the lowest closing price of iQSTEL shares over
the 90 days preceding the delivery of the trigger letter. 

Discount: Ralf will receive
a 20 discount on the above calculated share price; provided however, that the above calculated share price, without the discount, shall
count toward the purchase price in determining whether Ralf has received the full 750,000 USD valuation for his 49 ownership interest
in SwissLink. 

If, after the execution of all
tranches, Ralf has not received the full 750,000 USD valuation, we or our legal successor will pay the difference in cash until the full
valuation is realized based on the Weighted Volume Average Price (WVAP) of our shares for the last 15 trading days prior to the Termination
Date for shares still in Ralf's possession, and/or the actual selling price for shares already sold by Ralf. 

In addition, under the Agreement, Impact
agreed to render advisory services up to 60 hours per month to SwissLink and ETELIX, our wholly owned subsidiary, at 8,000 CHF per month
(excluding VAT) for a maximum of two years. 

 Next, SwissLink acknowledges a debt of
200,000 CHF owed to Ralf, which will be repaid in monthly installments of 8,000 CHF until the debt is fully repaid. 

 Finally, Ralf will continue to grant SwissLink
non-exclusive access to the VAMP platform, with the same cost and expense structure as outlined in the Share Purchase Agreement between
iQSTEL and Ralf, dated April 1, 2019.

revenue, has positive operating income when presented separately from the rest of our Company. The expenses of our pre-revenue companies
are set at the minimum required to finish the development of the product/services prior to market launch. When comparing the tables below,
we can see a tremendous evolution of our telecom division comparing the revenues, gross profit and operating income for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same periods of year 2023. As we have indicated on several occasions, our strategy is
to strengthen our telecommunications division so that it can serve as a lever for the development of new lines of business.

Other Expenses/Other Income 

We had other expenses of 2,646,275 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared with other income of 224,938 for the same period ended 2023. The difference between the compared
periods is primarily in due to a change in fair value of derivative liabilities of (1,063,789); and Interest Expense of (1,533,820). 

Net Income/Loss 

The Company finished the three months ended September
30, 2024 with a net loss of 773,004, as compared to a net income 45,909 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company
finished the nine months ended September 30, 2024 with a loss of 3,317,107, as compared to a loss of 274,557 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

The net results of the periods reported are highly
impacted by the expenses in the holding entity (iQSTEL), which has a high component of interest and other financial expenses related to
the funds borrowed for the acquisition of QXTEL Limited. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had total current assets
of 19,664,986 and current liabilities of 24,066,234, resulting in a negative working capital of 4,401,248. This compares with a positive
working capital of 1,878,228 at December 31, 2023. 

Our operating activities used 2,526,651 in the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 434,701 used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Investing activities used 2,950,367 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 340,583 used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
Use of funds in investing activities were primarily for the acquisition of subsidiary (QXTEL) for 2,730,121. 

Financing activities provided 6,239,489 in the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 1,454,756 provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our positive financing
cash flow in 2024 was largely the result of the proceeds from convertible notes of 3,997,500, funds used in the acquisition of QXTEL. 

We intend to
fund operations through increased sales and debt and/or equity financing arrangements to strengthen our liquidity and capital resources.
We also plan to seek additional financing in a private equity offering to secure funding for operations. There can be no assurance that
we will be successful in raising additional funding. If we are not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business
plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

Inflation 

Although our operations are influenced by general
economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Polices 

A
 critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and
results, and requires management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates
about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in the footnotes to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023 and in the footnotes to our financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those related to warrant accounting and complex debt instruments,
allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, and income taxes. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical
experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. See the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for a complete discussion
of our significant accounting policies. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, there were no off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

We do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting
pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operation, financial position, or cash flow. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company and are not required
to provide the information under this item pursuant to Regulation S-K. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures - Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

These controls are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of September 30, 2024. Our management
identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies
with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures
for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. 

We believe that our financial statements
presented in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations,
and cash flows for all periods presented herein. 

Inherent Limitations - Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdown can occur because
of simple error or mistake. In particular, many of our current processes rely upon manual reviews and processes to ensure that neither
human error nor system weakness has resulted in erroneous reporting of financial data. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting - There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024, which were identified in conjunction with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15
under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1A: Risk Factors 

In addition to the other information set forth in

Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Such risks described are not
the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that our management currently deems to be immaterial,
