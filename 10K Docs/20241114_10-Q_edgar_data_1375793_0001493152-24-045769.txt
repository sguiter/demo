 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR
THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 

 (Unaudited) 

of the issued and outstanding capital stock of its two subsidiaries - Global Trek Xploration, Inc., Level 2 Security
Products, Inc. 

Global
Trek Xploration, Inc. is a wearable technology company which designs, manufactures, sells, and distributes tracking and remote patient
monitoring solutions for humans, by utilizing patent protected proprietary hardware, software, connectivity, Global Positioning System GPS and Bluetooth Low Energy BLE monitoring and tracking platform, which provides real-time tracking
and monitoring of people. Utilizing a miniature quad-band GPRS transceiver, antenna, circuitry, battery and inductive charging pad our
solutions can be customized and integrated into numerous products whose location and movement can be monitored in real time over the
Internet through our 24x7 tracking portal or on a web enabled cellular telephone. Our core products and services are supported by an
IP portfolio of patents, patents pending, registered trademarks, copyrights, URL s and a library of software source code, all of
which is managed by Global Trek. 

Level
2 Security Products, Inc. is in the high value non-human asset monitoring and recovery business for items such as firearms, vehicles,
bikes, boats, ATVs, and a host of other valuable mobile assets which require oversight monitoring and theft recovery. 

LOCiMOBILE,
Inc s, digital assets are now under the management of the parent company MetAlert, and remain there, post dissolution, of the corporate
entity (LOCiMobile, Inc.). The Company s digital platform which has been at the forefront of Smartphone application App development since 2008 designs mobile applications that turn the iPhone, iPad, Android and other GPS enabled handsets into a tracking
device which can then be tracked from any mobile device or through our proprietary tracking portal or on any connected device with internet
access. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of MetAlert have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States for interim financial information and applicable regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement of financial position and results of operations
have been included. Our operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of MetAlert, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

Going
Concern 

The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets
and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company incurred losses and negative cash
flows from operations during the period ended September 30, 2024 and has negative working capital of as of September 30, 2024
and used cash in operations of during the period then ended. The Company anticipates further losses in the development of its
business. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after
the date the financial statements are issued. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s
ability to raise additional funds and implement its business plan until such time as revenues and related cash flows are sufficient to
fund our operations. 

The
Company s financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company
to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.
The Company s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of debt or equity is unknown. 

Licensing
Revenue 

Licensing
revenue recorded by the Company relates exclusively to the Company s monetization of IP licenses. The Company recognizes revenue
for licensing under ASC 606, which provides revenue recognition constraints by requiring the recognition of revenue at the later of the
following: 1) sale or usage of the products or 2) satisfaction of the performance obligations. 

as
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The Company s warranties are of an assurance-type and come standard with all Company products to cover repair
or replacement should product not perform as expected. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the
time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of
warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and recovery from suppliers. Management actively studies trends of warranty
claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty costs. The Company estimates the actual historical warranty
claims coupled with an analysis of unfulfilled claims to record a liability for specific warranty purposes. As of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, products returned for repair or replacement have been immaterial. Accordingly, a warranty liability has not been
deemed necessary.

segment for the manufacture and distribution of its products. In accordance with the Segment Reporting 
Topic of the ASC, the Company s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President,
who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing
guidance, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment information
quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the countries in which the
entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under Segment Reporting 
due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement, manufacturing
and distribution processes. Since the Company operates in one segment, all financial information required by Segment Reporting 
can be found in the accompanying financial statements.

As
part of the Level 2 Securities LLC acquisition, the Company determined the value of the IP (various tooling, product and software development,
trademarks, and patents costs) at this early stage, pre-revenue, by taking the accumulated selected costs, summing them by category,
and calculating each categories percent of the total, to come up with a list of capitalizable assets that had value as part of the merger.
These accumulated capitalized costs were then applied an obsolescence factor to discount those values, allowing for an arm s length,
non-bargain purchase price. This allocation of the IP was done using the cost approach as the economic benefit to MetAlert are the avoided
costs spent to date, and thus would not have to spend those development costs going forward ourselves. 

This
method is especially relevant when there are no reliable forecasts for the business at date of acquisition or said forecasts would involve
a lot of speculation. We then determined that a 5-year amortization period for these assets would be considered reasonable.

Organization
and Presentation 

Overview 

MetAlert
Inc., a Nevada Corporation, headquartered in Los Angeles, has developed a suite of products and solutions, powered by a proprietary real
time tracking technology platform, allowing remote monitoring, location-based tracking, health data collection of humans, and theft recovery
for high value assets. Many of the products have a wide range of applications, focusing on addressing two pressing global problems: remote
patient monitoring for people with cognitive decline, and the safety and recovery of firearms and other high value assets. Approximately
3 of the world s population has a form of cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer s, dementia, autism and traumatic brain
injury. And there are over 400 million firearms just in the United States alone. Each represents sizeable markets which Metalert has
patent protected products and solutions for, that generate revenues both from product sales and ongoing high margin recurring subscription
service fees. The Company sells both B2B and B2C, with international distributors supporting customers across North American, South America
and Europe. 

The
Company was originally founded in 2002 as Global Trek Xploration, Inc. and, as part of a reverse merger, became publicly traded in
2008 as a 100 wholly owned subsidiary of GTX Corp, a Nevada corporation, under its former name Deeas Resources Inc. 
In September 2022, the public Company changed its name from GTX Corp to MetAlert, Inc. and effected a 1-for-65 reverse stock split
of its issued and outstanding stock (OTC Pinks: MLRT). After the name change the Company maintained its ownership of its two wholly
owned subsidiaries. During the periods covered by this report, MetAlert, Inc. and its subsidiaries were engaged in business
operations that design, manufacture and sell various interrelated and complementary products and services in the wearable technology
and Personal Location Services marketplace. 

19 

In
September of 2023, we acquired Level 2 Security, LLC and merged it into a new 100 wholly owned subsidiary Level 2 Security Products,
Inc. During that period, the operations of LOCiMobile, Inc., another 100 wholly owned subsidiary, was consolidated under Global Trek
Xploration and the corporate entity was dissolved. MetAlert now owns 100 of the issued and outstanding capital stock of its two operating
subsidiaries - Global Trek Xploration, Inc. and Level 2 Security Products, Inc. The LOCiMOBILE digital assets are now under the management
of the parent company MetAlert and remain there, post dissolution, of the corporate entity (LOCiMobile, Inc.). The Company s digital
platform which has been at the forefront of Smartphone application App development since 2008 designs mobile applications
that turn the iPhone, iPad, Android and other GPS enabled handsets into a tracking device which can then be tracked from any mobile device
or through our proprietary tracking portal or on any connected device with internet access. In the first quarter of 2024, we launched
the Gen 2 version of the GunAlert product, across multiples channels, such as direct-to-consumer, retailers, non-profits, and government
agencies. Level 2 Security Products, Inc. is in the high value non-human asset monitoring and recovery business for items such as firearms,
vehicles, bikes, boats, ATVs, and a host of other valuable mobile assets which require oversight monitoring and theft recovery. 

Global
Trek Xploration, Inc. is a wearable technology company which designs, manufactures, sells, and distributes tracking and remote patient
monitoring solutions for humans, by utilizing patent protected proprietary hardware, software, connectivity, Global Positioning System GPS and Bluetooth Low Energy BLE monitoring and tracking platform, which provides real-time tracking

Revenues 

Revenues were 52,028 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 85,740 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of 39 . This decrease was primarily driven from delays
in production on our SmartSoles, where delivery of the finished product until early October of 2024, and not receiving inventory
for our newGunAlert version 2 until early October as well. 

As a result, during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, we did
not meet our overall revenue goals. We did however see some positive trends with international subscriptions increasing their growth by
62 for the period ended Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023 indicating that the international distributors are selling their inventory into the marketplace in their
respective countries. At the same time, we saw SmartSole B2C sales increasing by 59 in Q3 of 2024 partially attributable to a direct to
consume advertising campaign we began in the 3 rd quarter, as compared to Q3 2023, 

We
also worked on expanding our SmartSole distribution and began pilot programs in Spain and Portugal and with a large security company
in Mexico City whose testing and evaluation period has successfully led to the Company in Mexico placing their first SmartSole
order. 

During
the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company s customer base and revenue streams were comprised of approximately 63 B2B (Wholesale
Distributors and Enterprise Institutions), 37 B2C (consumers and government agencies who bought on the behalf of consumers, through
our online ecommerce platform and through Amazon, Google and iTunes). 

During
the period ended September 30, 2023, the Company s customer base and revenue streams were comprised of approximately 51 B2B (Wholesale
Distributors and Enterprise Institutions), 49 B2C (consumers and government agencies who bought on the behalf of consumers, through
our online ecommerce platform and through Amazon, Google and iTunes). 

Cost
of goods sold 

Cost
of goods sold were 32,715 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 85,664 for the three months ended September 30,
2023, representing a decrease of 62 . 

We
expect our margins to increase once we start ramping up our subscriptions and licensing and sell more of our proprietary products like
our SmartSoles and GunAlert, where we have limited competition. Our overall gross margin was higher than in 2023, predominately because
a greater portion of our revenues were subscription based where we recognize our highest profit margins. 

21 

We
continue to work with all our suppliers to reduce unnecessary expenses related to production inefficiencies in order to position ourselves
to maximize profits as we scale back up. 

Wages
and benefits 

Wages
and benefits decreased 44 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to three months ended September 30, 2023, predominantly
because of cost cutting and time saving initiatives. 

Professional
fees 

Professional
fees consist of costs attributable to consultants and contractors who primarily spend their time on legal, accounting, product development,
business development, corporate advisory services and shareholder communications. Such costs decreased 37,551 or 61 in the three months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Professional
fees have decreased primarily as a result of responsibilities being transferred from outside contractors and consultants to in-house personnel. 

Sales
and marketing expenses 

Sales
and marketing expenses remained comparable in the three months ended September 30, 2024, in comparison to the three months ended
September 30, 2023. 

General
and administrative 

General
and administrative costs in the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 7,485 or 11 in comparison to the three months
ended September 30, 2023, mostly due to decreases in development and production expenses. While at the same time, the Company continues many
cost saving measures, including the entire senior management team deferring salaries. 

Other
income/(expense), net 

Other
expenses, net decreased 64 or 112,085 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023. This decrease was primarily as a result of reductions in financing costs and reductions in amortizations of debt discounts. 

Net
income/(loss) 

Net
loss decreased by 54 or 231,731 from Q3 2024 in comparison to Q3 2023. This decrease, was primarily due to the lower revenues as we
transition out of direct-to-consumer PPE sales into our core B2B business, the effort to get the new Level 2 Security Products out
to market, reductions in amortizations of debt discounts and reduced financing costs.

Revenues 

Revenues
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 30 or 62,763 in comparison to the comparable 2023 period. This
decrease was primarily driven from transitioning out of direct-to-consumer PPE sales into our core B2B business and the effort to
get the new Level 2 Security Products out to market and from delays in finished goods production for our SmartSoles, where we did not receive
inventory until early October of 2024, and not receiving inventory for our new GunAlert version 2 until early October as
well.

a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not meet our overall revenue goals. We did however see some
positive trends compared to the comparable 2023 period, with international subscriptions increasing their growth by 62 for the
period ended nine months ended September 30, 2024 indicating that international distributors are selling their inventory into the
marketplace in their respective countries and at the same time we saw SmartSole B2C sales increasing by 25 in during the nine month
ended September 30, 2024, compared to the 2023 period. Additionally, we are
starting to see an increase in GunAlert subscriptions as six-month trail periods expire. 

We
also worked on expanding our SmartSole distribution and began pilot programs in the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal and with a large
security company in Mexico City whose testing and evaluation period having been successfully completed and has led to Mexico placing
their first SmartSole test order. The Mexico City customer is in the security business and has prompted us to identify other distributors,
both domestic and international, who also operate in a similar space. 

During
the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company s customer base and revenue streams were comprised of approximately 61 B2B (Wholesale
Distributors and Enterprise Institutions), 39 B2C (consumers and government agencies who bought on the behalf of consumers, through
our online ecommerce platform and through Amazon, Google and iTunes). 

During
the period ended September 30, 2023, the Company s customer base and revenue streams were comprised of approximately 79 B2B (Wholesale
Distributors and Enterprise Institutions), 21 B2C (consumers and government agencies who bought on the behalf of consumers, through
our online ecommerce platform and through Amazon, Google and iTunes).

Cost
of goods sold 

Cost
of goods sold decreased by 67 or 105,565 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in comparison to the comparable 2023 period.
This decrease was primarily due to the lower distributor hardware sales, which are larger volume orders, that are dependent upon the
activation of SmartSoles sold into their respective markets, which affects the timeliness of their hardware orders to maintain
adequate inventory levels. 

We
expect our margins to increase once we start ramping up our subscriptions and licensing, which we are starting to see in GunAlert subscription,
and sell more of our proprietary products like our SmartSoles and GunAlert, where we have limited competition. 

We
continue to work with all our suppliers to reduce unnecessary expenses related to production inefficiencies in order to position ourselves
to maximize profits as we scale back up. 

Wages
and benefits 

Wages
and benefits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 46 or 166,098 in comparison to the comparable 2023 period,
because of cost cutting and time saving initiatives. 

Professional
fees 

Professional
fees consist of costs attributable to consultants and contractors who primarily spend their time on legal, accounting, product
development, business development, corporate advisory services and investor relations. Such costs decreased 22,052 or 19 during
the period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the comparable 2023 period. 

Sales
and marketing expenses 

Sales
and marketing expenses increased by 204 or 10,911 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in comparison to the comparable
2023 period. The increase was primarily due to the release of the new GunAlert product line as we build brand awareness across multiple
media platforms. 

General
and administrative 

General
and administrative costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 4,995 or 3 in comparison to the comparable
2023 period, mostly due to increases in amortization expense of intangible assets from the Level2 acquisition. 

Other
income/(expense), net 

Other
expense, net decreased 25 or 68,411 from the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to the comparable 2023 period. This decrease was
primarily due to the of reductions in financing costs, reductions in amortizations of debt discounts and there being no gains on conversion or the extinguishment of debt during
the period ending as compared to the previous year. 

Net
income/(loss) 

Net
loss decreased by 32 or 284,457 from the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to the comparable 3 2023 period as explained
above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 29,308 of cash and cash equivalents, and a working capital deficit of 4,340,509, compared to 106,333
of cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of 3,730,701 as of December 31, 2023. 

24 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net loss was 602,834 compared to a net loss of 887,291 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30,
2023, was 336,174 and 295,166, respectively. 

Net
cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 4,875 and 42,408, respectively. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 301,917 and consisted of 140,000 received
for the issuance of debt, 200,000 received for the issuance of preferred shares, and payments to the line of credit of 12,153 and payments
on debt of 25,930. Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 350,556 and consisted
of 275,000 received for the issuance of debt and 100,000 from the sale of preferred stock, 46,881 from the use of the line of credit,
and payments to the line of credit of 29,021 and payments on debt of 42,304. 

Because
revenues from our operations have, to date, been insufficient to fund our working capital needs, we currently rely on the cash we receive
from our financing activities to fund our growth, capital expenditures and to support our working capital requirements. The sale of our
products and services is expected to enhance our liquidity in 2024, although the amount of revenues we receive in 2024 still cannot be
estimated. 

Until
such time as our products and services can support our working capital requirement, we expect to continue to generate revenues from our
other licenses, subscriptions, international distributors, hardware sales, professional services and new customers in the pipeline. However,
the amount of such revenues is unknown and is not expected to be sufficient to fund our working capital needs. For our internal budgeting
purposes, we have assumed that such revenues will not be sufficient to fund all of our planned operating and other expenditures during
2024. In addition, our actual cash expenditures may exceed our planned expenditures, particularly if we invest in the development of
improved versions of our existing products and technologies, and if we increase our marketing expenses. Accordingly, we anticipate that
we will have to continue to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations in 2024. No assurance can be given that we will
be able to obtain the additional funding we need to continue our operations. 

In
order to continue funding our growth, IP, working capital needs and new product development costs, during the first nine months of 2024
we relied upon existing sales and our SPA to fund purchase orders. However, no assurance can be given that the investor will provide
the funding, if and when requested by us. 

Going
Concern 

The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets
and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has suffered net losses, negative cash flows from operations, and has a negative working capital deficit. The Company anticipates further losses in the development of its business. Please see the section entitled Risk Factors 
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for more information regarding risks associated with
our business. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

There
are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to investors. 

Inflation 

We
believe that our business and operations could be materially affected by inflation, as unexpected increases in our costs could affect
how we manage operations

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e))
under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time specified in the Commission s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 

Based
on the evaluation as of September 30, 2024, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
