EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 We refer to Sotherly Hotels Inc. as the Company, Sotherly Hotels LP as the Operating Partnership, the Company s common stock as common stock, the Company s preferred stock as preferred stock, the Operating Partnership s common partnership interest as partnership units, and the Operating Partnership s preferred interest as the preferred units. References to we and our mean the Company, its Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries and predecessors, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated. 
 The Company conducts virtually all of its activities through the Operating Partnership and is its sole general partner. The Operating Partnership's partnership agreement provides that the Operating Partnership will assume and pay when due, or reimburse the Company for payment of all costs and expenses relating to the ownership and operations of, or for the benefit of, the Operating Partnership. The partnership agreement further provides that all expenses of the Company are deemed to be incurred for the benefit of the Operating Partnership. The Company does not conduct business itself, other than (a) acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, (b) issuing public equity from time to time, and (c) guaranteeing certain unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the business, directly or indirectly. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances made by the Company, which are generally contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the business through the Operating Partnership's operations, incurrence of indebtedness, and issuance of partnership units to third parties. 
 This report combines the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, of the Company and the Operating Partnership. We believe combining the quarterly reports into this single report results in the following benefits: 
 combined reports better reflect how management and investors view the business as a single operating unit; 

combined reports enhance investors understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole and in the same manner as management; 

combined reports are more efficient for the Company and the Operating Partnership and result in savings of time, effort and expense; and 

combined reports are more efficient for investors by reducing duplicative disclosure and providing a single document for their review. 

To help investors understand the significant differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report presents the following separate sections for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership: 
 Consolidated Financial Statements; 

the following Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: 

Note 6 Preferred Stock and Units; 

Note 7 Common Stock and Units; 

Note 12 Income Per Share and Per Unit; and 

Part I, Item 4 - Controls and Procedures; and 

Part II, Item 6 - Certifications of CEO and CFO pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

The Company estimates the fair value of its mortgage loans by discounting the future cash flows of each loan at estimated market rates consistent with the maturity of a mortgage loan with similar credit terms and credit characteristics, which are Level 2 inputs under the fair value hierarchy. Market rates take into consideration general market conditions and maturity.

 Overview 
 Sotherly Hotels Inc. is a self-managed and self-administered lodging REIT incorporated in Maryland in August 2004 and focused on the acquisition, renovation, up-branding and repositioning of upscale to upper-upscale full-service hotels in the southern United States. Sotherly may also opportunistically acquire hotels throughout the United States. Substantially all of the assets of Sotherly Hotels Inc. are held by, and all of its operations are conducted through, Sotherly Hotels LP. We commenced operations in December 2004 when we completed our initial public offering and thereafter consummated the acquisition of the Initial Properties. 
 Our hotel portfolio currently consists of ten full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotels, comprising 2,786 rooms, as well as interests in two condominium hotels and their associated rental programs. The Company owns hotels that operate under well-known brands such as DoubleTree by Hilton, Tapestry Collection by Hilton, and Hyatt Centric, as well as independent hotels. We sometimes refer to our independent and soft-branded properties as our collection of boutique hotels. As of June 30, 2024, our portfolio consisted of the following hotel properties:

At any given time, some portion of the units participating in our rental program may be occupied by the unit owner(s) and unavailable for rental to hotel guests. We sometimes refer to each participating condominium unit as a room. 

We conduct substantially all our business through our Operating Partnership. We are the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, and we own an approximate 98.2 interest in our Operating Partnership, as of the date of this report, with the remaining interest being held by limited partners who were the contributors of our Initial Properties and related assets. 
 To qualify as a REIT, neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership can operate our hotels. Therefore, our wholly-owned hotel properties are leased to our MHI TRS Entities, which are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. Our MHI TRS Entities then engage an eligible independent hotel management company to operate the hotels under a management 
 35 

agreement. Our MHI TRS Entities have engaged Our Town to manage our hotels. Our MHI TRS Entities, and their parent, MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc., are consolidated into each of our financial statements for accounting purposes. The earnings of MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc. are subject to taxation similar to other C corporations. 
 Key Operating Metrics 
 In the hotel industry, room revenue is considered the most important category of revenue and drives other revenue categories such as food, beverage, catering, parking, and telephone. There are three key performance indicators used in the hotel industry to measure room revenues: 
 Occupancy, or the number of rooms sold, usually expressed as a percentage of total rooms available; 

Average daily rate, or ADR, which is total room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold; and 

Revenue per available room, or RevPAR, which is total room revenue divided by the total number of available rooms. 

RevPAR changes that are primarily driven by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenues and profitability than changes that are driven primarily by changes in ADR. For example, an increase in occupancy at a hotel would lead to additional variable operating costs (such as housekeeping services, laundry, utilities, room supplies, franchise fees, management fees, credit card commissions and reservations expense), but could also result in increased non-room revenue from the hotel s restaurant, banquet or parking facilities. Changes in RevPAR that are primarily driven by changes in ADR typically have a greater impact on operating margins and profitability as they do not generate all of the additional variable operating costs associated with higher occupancy. 
 When calculating composite portfolio metrics, we include available rooms at the Lyfe Resort Residences and the Hyde Beach House Resort Residences that participate in our rental programs and are not reserved for owner-occupancy. 
 We also use FFO, Adjusted FFO and Hotel EBITDA as measures of our operating performance. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024, to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 
 Revenue . Total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024, increased by approximately 1.7 million, or 3.4 , to approximately 50.7 million compared to total revenue of approximately 49.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Increases of approximately 1.7 million in total revenue at eleven of our properties accounted for the change. The aggregate increase in total revenue reflects an overall increase in room occupancy by 5.8 , we also received higher food and beverage revenues and comparable other operating revenues, coming from better group business for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, versus the comparable period in 2023. 
 36 

Room revenue increased approximately 1.3 million, or 4.0 , to approximately 34.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to room revenue of approximately 33.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. RevPAR for the three month period increased 4.3 from 131.94 in 2023, to 137.67 in 2024, driven by a 4.0 increase in occupancy. Increases in room revenue at eight of our wholly-owned properties were driven by increases in small group and corporate business travel demand and offset room revenue decreases at the remaining two wholly-owned properties. 
 Food and beverage revenues increased approximately 0.4 million, or 4.2 , to approximately 9.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to food and beverage revenues of approximately 9.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Increases in banqueting and catering for small groups and meetings as well as increases in demand at our restaurant outlets at five of our wholly-owned properties offset decreases at the remaining five wholly-owned properties. 
 Revenue from other operating departments decreased slightly by approximately 0.1 million, or 0.7 , to approximately 6.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to revenue from other operating departments of approximately 6.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. 
 Hotel Operating Expenses . Hotel operating expenses, which consist of room expenses, food and beverage expenses, other direct expenses, indirect expenses and management fees, increased approximately 0.8 million, or 2.4 , to approximately 35.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to total hotel operating expenses of approximately 34.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in hotel operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024, resulted from an aggregate increase at eight of our hotel properties by approximately 1.1 million, offset by decreases totaling approximately 0.3 million from four of our properties. This increase in hotel operating expenses was directly related to the increases in room revenues and food and beverage revenues and other operating expenses at a number of our hotels and higher indirect expenses as described below. 
 Room expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024, increased by approximately 0.4 million, or 6.2 , to approximately 7.4 million, compared to rooms expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023, of approximately 7.0 million. The increase was directly related to the increase in room revenue. 
 Food and beverage expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024, increased approximately 0.1 million, or 2.4 , to approximately 6.5 million, compared to food and beverage expenses of approximately 6.4 million, for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The net increase in food and beverage expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024, resulted from an aggregate increase of approximately 0.3 million from four of our properties, with offsetting decreases at our remaining properties. The increase was directly related to the increase in food and beverage revenue. 
 Expenses from other operating departments for the three months ended June 30, 2024, increased approximately 0.2 million or 8.7 , to approximately 2.5 million, compared to other operating departments expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023, of approximately 2.3 million. The increase was directly related to the increase in other departments revenue. 
 Indirect expenses at our wholly-owned properties for the three months ended June 30, 2024, slightly increased by 0.2 , to approximately 18.5 million, compared to indirect expenses of approximately 18.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. 
 Corporate General and Administrative. Corporate general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024, decreased approximately 0.2 million, or 11.7 , to approximately 1.6 million compared to corporate general and administrative expenses of approximately 1.8 million, for the three months ended June 30, 2023. A decrease in legal and professional fees for the current quarter accounted for the majority of this decrease. 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024, increased approximately 0.7 million, or 16.6 , to approximately 5.0 million, as compared to interest expense of approximately 4.3 million, for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024, was substantially related to increases from interest rate swaps ending for both our mortgage loans on our properties DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton. This affected the interest expense by increasing interest rates on these variable rate mortgages. We also refinanced the Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton mortgage during the previous quarter ended March 31, 2024, which increased the loan amount and increased the interest rate to a fixed rate of 8.49 . 
 Unrealized Loss on Hedging Activities. As of June 30, 2024, there was an interest rate cap related to the mortgage loan on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport with a fair value of approximately 0.8 million, which capped the interest rate down by 3.0 . There was an unrealized loss on the fair value of this cap of approximately 0.1 million, compared to an unrealized gain of approximately 0.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023. 
 37 

Gain on Involuntary Conversion of Assets. Gain on involuntary conversion of assets decreased approximately 0.7 million, from approximately 0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, to approximately 0.1 million, for the three months ending June 30, 2024. The gain was related to casualties at two of our properties in Hollywood, Florida and Arlington, Virginia. 
 Income Taxes. We had an income tax provision of 17,184 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to an income tax provision of 16,537, for the three months ended June 30, 2023. 
 Net Income . We realized a net income for the three months ended June 30, 2024, of approximately 4.7 million, compared to a net income of approximately 5.3 million, for the three months ended June 30, 2023, because of the operating results discussed above. 
 Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024, to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 
 Revenue . Total revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024, increased by approximately 4.7 million, or 5.1 , to approximately 97.2 million compared to total revenue of approximately 92.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Increases of approximately 5.2 million in total revenue at 10 of our properties accounted for the change. The aggregate increase in total revenue reflects an overall increase in room occupancy by 6.5 , we also received higher food and beverage revenues and comparable other operating revenues, coming from better group business for the six months ended June 30, 2024, versus the comparable period in 2023. 
 Room revenue increased approximately 2.6 million, or 4.3 , to approximately 64.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to room revenue of approximately 61.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. RevPAR for the six month period increased 4.1 from 125.53 in 2023, to 130.64 in 2024, driven by a 6.5 increase in occupancy. Increases in room revenue at seven of our wholly-owned properties were driven by increases in small group and corporate business travel demand and offset room revenue decreases at the remaining three wholly-owned properties. 
 Food and beverage revenues increased approximately 1.4 million, or 7.7 , to approximately 19.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to food and beverage revenues of approximately 18.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Increases in banqueting and catering for small groups and meetings as well as increases in demand at our restaurant outlets at seven of our wholly-owned properties offset decreases at the remaining three wholly-owned properties. 
 Revenue from other operating departments increased by approximately 0.7 million, or 5.3 , to approximately 13.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to revenue from other operating departments of approximately 12.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. 
 Hotel Operating Expenses . Hotel operating expenses, which consist of room expenses, food and beverage expenses, other direct expenses, indirect expenses and management fees, increased approximately 3.6 million, or 5.5 , to approximately 69.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to total hotel operating expenses of approximately 65.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in hotel operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, resulted from an aggregate increase at nine of our hotel properties by approximately 4.0 million, offset by decreases totaling approximately 0.4 million from three of our properties. This increase in hotel operating expenses was directly related to the increases in room revenues and food and beverage revenues and other operating expenses at a number of our hotels and higher indirect expenses as described below. 
 Room expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024, increased by approximately 0.6 million, or 4.3 , to approximately 14.0 million, compared to rooms expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023, of approximately 13.4 million. The increase was directly related to the increase in room revenue. 
 Food and beverage expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, increased approximately 0.7 million, or 5.5 , to approximately 13.0 million, compared to food and beverage expenses of approximately 12.3 million, for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The net increase in food and beverage expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, resulted from an aggregate increase of approximately 0.9 million from seven of our properties, with offsetting decreases at our remaining properties. The increase was directly related to the increase in food and beverage revenue. 
 Expenses from other operating departments for the six months ended June 30, 2024, increased approximately 0.6 million or 12.3 , to approximately 5.2 million, compared to other operating departments expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023, of approximately 4.6 million. The increase was directly related to the increase in other departments revenue. 
 Indirect expenses at our wholly-owned properties for the six months ended June 30, 2024, increased approximately 1.8 million, or 5.0 , to approximately 37.0 million, compared to indirect expenses of approximately 35.2 million for the six months ended June 
 38 

30, 2023. The increase was related to increases in administration and general, repairs and maintenance, energy and utilities, insurance and real estate and personal property taxes. 
 Corporate General and Administrative. Corporate general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, decreased approximately 0.3 million, or 7.2 , to approximately 3.5 million compared to corporate general and administrative expenses of approximately 3.8 million, for the six months ended June 30, 2023. A decrease in legal and professional fees for the current period accounted for the majority of this decrease. 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024, increased approximately 1.5 million, or 17.7 , to approximately 9.9 million, as compared to interest expense of approximately 8.4 million, for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was substantially related to increases from interest rate swaps ending for both our mortgage loans on our properties DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton. This affected the interest expense by increasing interest rates on these variable rate mortgages. We also refinanced the Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton mortgage during the previous quarter ended March 31, 2024, which increased the loan amount and increased the interest rate to a fixed rate of 8.49 . 
 Realized Gain on Hedging Activities. The realized gain on hedging activities during the six months ended June 30, 2024, was approximately 1.0 million, due to termination of the Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton interest rate swap. 
 Unrealized Loss on Hedging Activities. As of June 30, 2024, there was a new interest rate cap related to the mortgage loan on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport with a fair value of approximately 0.8 million, which capped the interest rate down by 3.0 , with an unrealized loss on hedging activities of approximately 0.1 million. There was also an unrealized loss on the fair value of the Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton interest rate swap of approximately 0.7 million. These two aggregated losses of approximately 0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a loss of approximately 0.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023. 
 Gain on Involuntary Conversion of Assets. Gain on involuntary conversion of assets decreased approximately 0.5 million, from approximately 0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to approximately 0.2 million, for the six months ending June 30, 2024. The gain was related to casualties at two of our properties in Hollywood, Florida and Arlington, Virginia. 
 Income Taxes. We had an income tax provision of 35,277 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to an income tax provision of 31,719, for the six months ended June 30, 2023. 
 Net Income . We realized a net income for the six months ended June 30, 2024, of approximately 6.0 million, compared to a net income of approximately 6.6 million, for the six months ended June 30, 2023, because of the operating results discussed above. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We consider the non-GAAP financial measures of FFO attributable to common stockholders and unitholders (including FFO per common share and unit), Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders and unitholders, EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA to be key supplemental measures of the Company s performance and could be considered along with, not alternatives to, net income (loss) as a measure of the Company s performance. These measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by generally accepted accounting principles GAAP or amounts available for the Company s discretionary use and should not be considered alternative measures of net income, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. 
 
 FFO and Adjusted FFO . Industry analysts and investors use Funds from Operations FFO ), as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity REIT. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income or loss determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, gains or losses from involuntary conversions of assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization or impairment, stock compensation costs and after adjustment for any noncontrolling interest from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate 
 39 

values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by itself. 
 We consider FFO to be a useful measure of adjusted net income (loss) for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because we believe FFO is most directly comparable to net income (loss), which remains the primary measure of performance, because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO assists in comparing the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Although FFO is intended to be a REIT industry standard, other companies may not calculate FFO in the same manner as we do, and investors should not assume that FFO as reported by us is comparable to FFO as reported by other REITs. 
 We further adjust FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders for certain additional items that are not in NAREIT s definition of FFO, including changes in deferred income taxes, any unrealized gain (loss) on hedging instruments, losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains on extinguishment of preferred stock, aborted offering costs, loan modification fees, franchise termination costs, costs associated with the departure of executive officers, litigation settlement, management contract termination costs, operating asset depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on a change in control, ESOP and stock compensation expenses and negative lease amortization on our finance ground lease obligation. We exclude these items as we believe it allows for meaningful 
 40 

comparisons between periods and among other REITs and is more indicative than FFO of the on-going performance of our business and assets. Our calculation of adjusted FFO may be different from similar measures calculated by other REITs. 
 The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO and Adjusted FFO, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:

EBITDA. We believe that excluding the effect of non-operating expenses and non-cash charges, and the portion of those items related to unconsolidated entities, all of which are also based on historical cost accounting and may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance, can help eliminate the accounting effects of depreciation and financing decisions and facilitate comparisons of core operating profitability between periods and between REITs, even though EBITDA also does not represent an amount that accrued directly to shareholders. 
 
 Hotel EBITDA . We define Hotel EBITDA as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) income tax provision or benefit, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) impairment of long-lived assets or investments, (6) gains and losses on disposal and/or sale of assets, (7) gains and losses on involuntary conversions of assets, (8) realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments not included in other comprehensive income, (9) loss on early debt extinguishment, (10) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) debt forgiveness, (11) gain on exercise of development right, (12) corporate general and administrative expense, and (13) other operating revenue not related to our wholly-owned portfolio. We believe this provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our wholly-owned hotels and its operators have direct control. We believe Hotel EBITDA provides 
 41 

investors with supplemental information on the on-going operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of third-party management companies operating our business on a property-level basis.

Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Our principal sources of cash are cash from hotel operations, proceeds from the sale of common and preferred stock, proceeds from the sale of secured and unsecured notes, proceeds of mortgage and other debt and hotel property sales. Our principal uses of cash are acquisitions of hotel properties, capital expenditures, debt service and balloon maturities, operating costs, corporate expenses and dividends. As of June 30, 2024, we had approximately 18.9 million of unrestricted cash and 18.4 million of restricted cash. 
 Operating Activities. Our net cash flow provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was approximately 16.7 million, generally consisting of net cash flow provided by hotel operations. The positive cash flow from operations during the quarter and increase from the prior year was due to the increase in occupancy at our hotels as a result of increases in leisure transient, small group and corporate business travel. Cash used in or provided by operating activities generally consists of the cash flow from hotel operations, offset by the interest portion of our debt service, corporate expenses and positive or negative changes in working capital. 
 Investing Activities. Our cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was approximately 5.0 million. Of this amount approximately 5.2 million was related to capital expenditures for improvements and additions to hotel properties. There were also insurance proceeds related to involuntary conversions of approximately 0.2 million. 
 Financing Activities . During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company and Operating Partnership received proceeds from a mortgage loan of 35.0 million, received proceeds from the redemption of the Tampa interest rate swap of approximately 1.0 million, made principal payments on our mortgages of approximately 30.2 million, payments on our unsecured notes of approximately 0.4 million and payments on deferred financing costs of approximately 1.0 million, and paid preferred dividends of approximately 4.0 million. 
 42 

Capital Expenditures 
 We intend to maintain all our hotels, including any hotel we acquire in the future, in good repair and condition, in conformity with applicable laws and regulations and, when applicable, with franchisor s standards. Routine capital improvements are determined through the annual budget process over which we maintain approval rights, and which are implemented or administered by our management company. 
 Historically, we have aimed to maintain overall capital expenditures, except for those required by our franchisors as a condition to a franchise license or license renewal, at 4.0 of gross revenue. For 2024, we expect total capital expenditures for the routine replacement and refurbishment of furniture, fixtures and equipment for 2024 to be approximately 7.0 million. 
 We expect a substantial portion of our capital expenditures for the routine replacement or refurbishment of furniture, fixtures and equipment at our properties will be funded by our replacement reserve accounts, other than costs that we incur to make capital improvements required by our franchisors. Reserve accounts are escrowed accounts with funds deposited monthly and reserved for capital improvements or expenditures with respect to all of our hotels. We deposit an amount equal to 4.0 of gross revenue for The DeSoto, the Hotel Ballast Wilmington, Tapestry Collection by Hilton, the Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton, the DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach, the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverside, the DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel, The Whitehall and the Georgian Terrace as well as 4.0 of room revenues for the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and the Hyatt Centric Arlington on a monthly basis. 
 From time to time, certain of our hotel properties may undergo renovations as a result of our decision to upgrade portions of the hotel, such as guestrooms, meeting space and restaurants, in order to better compete with other hotels in our markets. In addition, we may be required by one or more of our franchisors to complete a PIP in order to bring the hotel up to the franchisor s standards. Generally, we expect to fund renovations and improvements out of working capital, including replacement reserve accounts, proceeds of mortgage debt or equity offerings. 
 During fiscal years 2024, 2025, and 2026, we expect total capital expenditures related to the renovation of our property in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania of approximately 11.5 million as a condition to the renewal of our franchise license. On April 29, 2024, coincident with the extension of the mortgage loan, we placed 5.0 million into a reserve account to partially fund the renovation. In addition, provided we meet certain financial covenants, we expect the release of 1.2 million of other reserves in additional funding on or after June 30, 2025. The remainder of the capital expenditures will be funded out of working capital. As of June 30, 2024, we had incurred costs totaling approximately 0.3 million. 
 During fiscal years 2024, 2025, and 2026, we expect total capital expenditures related to the renovation of our property in Jacksonville, Florida of approximately 14.6 million, as a condition to the renewal of our franchise license. On July 8, 2024, in conjunction with the refinance of the mortgage with Fifth Third Bank, N.A., we secured additional funding of 9.49 million to partially fund the product improvement plan. The remainder of the capital expenditures will be funded out of working capital. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of June 30, 2024, we had total cash and cash equivalents of approximately 18.9 million and restricted cash of approximately 18.4 million. We expect that our cash on hand combined with our cash flow from our hotels should be adequate to fund continuing operations, routine capital expenditures for the refurbishment and replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment, and monthly scheduled payments of principal and interest (excluding any balloon payments due upon maturity of our mortgage debt). 
 On February 7, 2024, we secured a 35.0 million mortgage on the Hotel Alba located in Tampa, Florida with Cit Real Estate Funding, Inc. The loan has a maturity date of March 6, 2029; carries a fixed rate of interest of 8.49 , requires monthly payments of interest only; and cannot be prepaid until the last four months of the loan term. We used a portion of the proceeds to repay the existing first mortgage on the hotel. The remainder of the proceeds were used for working capital. 
 On April 29, 2024, we amended the mortgage loan agreement on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport with the existing lender, TD Bank, N.A. The amendment extends the loan s maturity to April 29, 2026; requires payments of interest only at existing terms of interest at a floating rate based on SOFR plus 3.50 ; and required a principal reduction of 3.0 million. Existing reserves were increased by 2.0 million and a separate reserve of 5.0 million was established for the anticipated renovation of the property in conjunction with the renewal of the franchise license. 
 On July 8, 2024, we secured a 26.25 million mortgage loan on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront hotel located in Jacksonville, Florida with Fifth Third Bank, N.A. The loan provides for an additional 9.49 million available to fund a product 
 43 

improvement plan at the hotel; matures on July 8, 2029; requires monthly payments of interest at a floating interest rate of SOFR plus 3.00 plus principal of 38,700. Proceeds of the loan were used to repay the existing mortgage. 
 On August 14, 2024, we secured a 5.0 million second mortgage loan on the DeSoto hotel located in Savannah, GA with MONY Life Insurance Company. The loan has a maturity date of July 1, 2026 and requires level payments of principal and interest at a fixed interest rate of 7.50 and amortizing on a 25-year schedule. Proceeds of the loan were used for working capital. 
 As of the date of this report, we were current on all mortgage and other loan payments per the terms of our agreements, as amended. 
 In June 2025, the mortgage on The Georgian Terrace in Atlanta, Georgia matures. We intend to refinance the mortgage but may be required to reduce the level of indebtedness by an amount of up to 5.25 million based upon anticipated financial performance of the property and anticipated market conditions. 
 In October 2025, the mortgage on the DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach matures. We intend to refinance the mortgage but may be required to reduce the level of indebtedness by an amount of up to 12.5 million based upon anticipated financial performance of the property and anticipated market conditions. 
 We intend to continue to invest in hotel properties as suitable opportunities arise. The success of our acquisition strategy depends, in part, on our ability to access additional capital through other sources, which we expect to be limited as a result of the economic changes in the travel industry coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. There can be no assurance that we will continue to make investments in properties that meet our investment criteria or have access to capital during this period. Additionally, we may choose to dispose of certain hotels as a means to provide liquidity. 
 Over the long term, we expect to meet our liquidity requirements for hotel property acquisitions, property redevelopment, investments in new joint ventures and debt maturities, and the retirement of maturing mortgage debt, through net proceeds from additional issuances of common shares, additional issuances of preferred shares, issuances of units of limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership, secured and unsecured borrowings, the selective disposition of non-core assets, and cash on hand. We remain committed to a flexible capital structure and strive to maintain prudent debt leverage. 
 
 Financial Covenants 
 Mortgage Loans 
 Our mortgage loan agreements contain various financial covenants directly related to the financial performance of the collateralized properties. Failure to comply with these financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in the local competitive environment, disruption caused by renovation activity, major weather disturbances as well as general economic conditions. 
 As described in Liquidity and Capital Resources , as of June 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, current on all loan payments and not otherwise in default under any of our mortgage loans, with the exception of a covenant default under the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport. In April 2024, we obtained a waiver of non-compliance with the financial covenants for the quarters ended September 30 and December 31, 2023. In May 2024, we obtained a waiver of non-compliance with the financial covenants for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we failed to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront. If we are unable to receive a waiver, we may be required to reduce the outstanding balance with a prepayment of approximately 1.2 million or provide an equivalent amount of cash collateral until we establish compliance. 
 Certain of our loan agreements contain cash trap provisions that may be triggered if the performance of the applicable hotel declines below a certain threshold. As of June 30, 2024, the provisions under the mortgage secured by the DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach were triggered, which will require substantially all the revenue generated by the hotel to be deposited directly into a lockbox account and swept into a cash management account for the benefit of the lender until the property meets the criteria in the loan agreement for exiting the cash trap. 
 44 

Dividend Policy 
 We may not make distributions with respect to any shares of our common stock, unless and until full cumulative distributions on the outstanding preferred stock for all past unpaid periods are paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof in cash is set aside. 
 On January 24, 2023, we announced that we will resume quarterly distributions to holders of our preferred stock and set a record date of February 28, 2023 with a payment date of March 15, 2023. 
 On April 24, 2023, we announced the declaration of a quarterly distribution to holders of our preferred stock with a record date of May 31, 2023 and a payment date of June 13, 2023. 
 On May 30, 2023, we announced the declaration of a "catch up" distribution to holders of our preferred stock with a record date of June 30, 2023 and a payment date of July 14, 2023. 
 On August 1, 2023, we announced the declaration of a quarterly distribution to holders of our preferred stock with a record date of August 31, 2023 and a payment date of September 15, 2023. 
 On October 30, 2023, we announced the declaration of a quarterly distribution to holders of our preferred stock with a record date of November 30, 2023 and a payment date of December 15, 2023. 
 On January 30, 2024, we announced the declaration of a quarterly distribution to holders of our preferred stock with a record date of February 29, 2024 and a payment date of March 15, 2024. 
 On April 30, 2024, we announced the declaration of a quarterly distribution to holders of our preferred stock with a record date of May 31, 2024 and a payment date of June 17, 2024. 
 On July 30, 2024, we announced the declaration of a quarterly distribution to holders of our preferred stock with a record date of August 30, 2024 and a payment date of September 16, 2024. 
 On October 29, 2024, we announced the declaration of a quarterly distribution to holders of our preferred stock with a record date of November 29, 2024 and a payment date of December 16, 2024 . 
 As of June 30, 2024, the amount of cumulative unpaid dividends on our outstanding preferred shares as approximately 21.9 million. We expect that any reduction in the level of cumulative unpaid distributions will be made in the form of a series of "catch up" distributions, such as the distribution announced on May 30, 2023. The amount, timing and frequency of distributions, including additional catch-up distributions, will be authorized by our board of directors and based upon a variety of factors deemed relevant by the directors. No assurance can be given that the distribution policy will not change in the future. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 None. 
 Inflation 
 We generate revenues primarily from lease payments from our MHI TRS Entities and net income from the operations of our MHI TRS Entities. Therefore, we rely primarily on the performance of the individual properties and the ability of the management company to increase revenues and to keep pace with inflation. Operators of hotels, in general, possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to keep pace with inflation. However, competitive pressures at some or all of our hotels may limit the ability of the management company to raise room rates. 
 Our expenses, including hotel operating expenses, administrative expenses, real estate taxes and property and casualty insurance are subject to inflation. These expenses are expected to grow with the general rate of inflation, except for energy, liability insurance, property and casualty insurance, property tax rates, employee benefits, and some wages, which are expected to increase at rates that differ from the general rate of inflation. 
 45 

Geographic Concentration and Seasonality 
 Our hotels are located in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse market conditions in these geographic areas, including industry downturns, relocation of businesses, local stay-at-home and business closure orders, adverse weather conditions and any oversupply of hotel rooms or a reduction in lodging demand. Adverse economic developments in the markets in which we have a concentration of hotels, or in any of the other markets in which we operate, or any increase in hotel supply or decrease in lodging demand resulting from the local, regional or national business climate, could materially and adversely affect us. 
 The operations of our hotel properties have historically been seasonal. The months of April and May are traditionally strong, as is October. The periods from mid-November through mid-February are traditionally slow with the exception of hotels located in certain markets, namely Florida and Texas, which typically experience significant room demand during this period. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. It is possible that the actual amounts may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgment on an ongoing basis, based on information that is available to us, our business and industry experience, and various other matters that we believe are reasonable and appropriate for consideration under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies, including certain critical accounting policies, are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies or the methods or assumptions we apply. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a summary of recently adopted and newly issued accounting pronouncements, please refer to the New Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Item 3.	 Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures about Market Risk 
 The effects of potential changes in interest rates are discussed below. Our market risk discussion includes forward-looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that could occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates. These disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but only indicators of reasonably possible losses. As a result, actual future results may differ materially from those presented. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates. 
 To meet in part our long-term liquidity requirements, we will borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. From time to time we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. We do not intend to hold or issue derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. 
 As of June 30, 2024, we had approximately 273.4 million of fixed-rate debt, including the PPP Loans of approximately 1.1 million, with a fixed rate of 1.0 and approximately 49.8 million of variable-rate debt. The weighted-average interest rate on the fixed-rate debt was 5.28 . A change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of our debt would impact the fair value of the debt but have no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. Our variable-rate debt is exposed to changes in interest rates, specifically the changes in the Prime Rate. Assuming that the aggregate amount outstanding on the mortgages on our Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Houston, Texas hotels remains at approximately 49.8 million, the balance at June 30, 2024, the impact on our annual interest incurred and cash flows of a one percent increase in SOFR and the Prime Rate, would be approximately 0.3 million. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 266.0 million of fixed-rate debt, including the mortgage on our Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton, which is fixed by an interest rate swap to 5.576 and the PPP Loans of 1.5 million, with a fixed rate of 1.0 and approximately 52.9 million of variable-rate debt. The weighted-average interest rate on the fixed-rate debt was 4.87 . A change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of our debt would impact the fair value of the debt but have no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. Our variable-rate debt is exposed to changes in interest rates, specifically the changes in 1-month LIBOR, SOFR, and in Prime Rate. Assuming that the aggregate amounts outstanding on the mortgage on The Whitehall remains at approximately 14.0 million and the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport remains at approximately 38.9 million, the balance at December 31, 2023, the impact on our annual interest incurred and cash flows of a one percent increase in 1-month SOFR and in Prime Rate, would be approximately 0.4 million.

Item 4.	 Controls and Procedures 
 Sotherly Hotels Inc. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management, under the supervision and participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act), as of June 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of June 30, 2024, its disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to ensure that (i) information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and instructions, and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 The Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures or its internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of the controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Sotherly Hotels Inc. have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in Sotherly Hotels Inc. s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act during Sotherly Hotels Inc. s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Sotherly Hotels Inc. s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Sotherly Hotels LP 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Operating Partnership s management, under the supervision and participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Sotherly Hotels Inc., as general partner, has evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act), as of June 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of June 30, 2024, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to ensure that (i) information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and instructions, and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 The Operating Partnership s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Sotherly Hotels Inc., as general partner, does not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or the internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of the controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Sotherly Hotels LP have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in Sotherly Hotels LP s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act during Sotherly Hotels LP s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Sotherly Hotels LP s internal control over financial reporting.
