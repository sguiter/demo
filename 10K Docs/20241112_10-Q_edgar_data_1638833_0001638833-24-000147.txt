The cash flows related to the interest rate caps are classified as operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 The Company's interest rate swap agreements, excluding the portion treated as debt, are recognized at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are valued using pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curve data, which are classified as Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the interest rate caps is determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the caps are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. The interest rate caps are classified using Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. 
 For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI") and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings, as documented at hedge inception in accordance with the Company s accounting policy election. Amounts reported in accumulated OCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate debt. Over the next 12 months, the Company estimates that an additional million will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense.

 Executive Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned or operated, primarily in partnership with physicians, a portfolio of 166 surgical facilities comprised of 147 ASCs and 19 surgical hospitals across 33 states. We owned a majority interest in 89 of the surgical facilities and consolidated 123 of these facilities for financial reporting purposes. 
 Total revenues for the third quarter of 2024 increased 14.3 to 770.4 million from 674.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in revenues was attributable to same-facility revenue growth and the net impact from acquisitions and divestitures completed during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. Days adjusted same-facility revenues for the third quarter of 2024 increased 4.2 from the third quarter of 2023, with an 0.5 increase in revenue per case and a 3.7 increase in same-facility cases. Additionally, for the third quarter of 2024, Adjusted EBITDA increased 21.9 to 128.6 million compared to 105.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to revenue growth, continued cost management initiatives and acquisitions completed since the prior year period. For the third quarter of 2024, net loss attributable to Surgery Partners, Inc. was 31.7 million compared to 4.9 million for the same period in 2023. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures appears below under the heading "Certain Non-GAAP Measures." 
 We continue to focus on improving our same-facility performance, selectively acquiring established facilities, developing new facilities and other portfolio management initiatives. During the third quarter of 2024, we acquired a controlling interest in several physician practices for aggregate cash consideration of 26.6 million, net of cash acquired. 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of 221.8 million and 595.8 million of borrowing capacity under the Revolver as of September 30, 2024.

Revenues 
 Our revenues consist of patient service revenues and other service revenues. Patient service revenues consist of revenue from our Surgical Facility Services and Ancillary Services segments. Specifically, patient service revenues include fees for surgical or diagnostic procedures performed at surgical facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes, as well as for patient visits to our physician practices, anesthesia services, pharmacy services and diagnostic screens ordered by our physicians. Other service revenues include management and administrative service fees derived from our non-consolidated facilities that we account for under the equity method, management of surgical facilities and physician practices in which we do not own an interest, management services we provide to physician practices for which we are not required to provide capital or additional assets and other non-patient services. 
 The following table summarizes revenues by service type as a percentage of total revenues:

We believe this diversification helps to protect us from adverse pricing and utilization trends in any individual procedure type and results in greater consistency in our case volume. 
 The following table sets forth the percentage of cases in each specialty performed at the surgical facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes for the periods indicated:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 221.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 195.9 million at December 31, 2023. 
 The primary source of our operating cash flows is the collection of accounts receivable from private insurance companies, federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs) and individuals. Our cash flows provided by operating activities was 188.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 231.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 214.0 million compared to net cash used of 110.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 324.6 million was primarily driven by net proceeds received from the issuance and sale of 800.0 million in senior unsecured notes, partially offset by the redemption of all the Existing Notes (as discussed in the following section). The remaining increase was due to net borrowings on the Revolver used to fund acquisitions completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Debt 
 On April 10, 2024, we completed the issuance and sale of 800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2032 (the "2032 Notes"). The 2032 Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 7.250 per year, payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2024. Proceeds from sale of the 2032 Notes were used (i) to redeem all of the outstanding 2025 Notes and 2027 Notes, (ii) to pay accrued interest on the Existing Notes through, but not including, April 25, 2024, (iii) to pay related fees and expenses in connection with the offering of the 2032 Notes and redemption of the Existing Notes, and (iv) for general corporate purposes, including to fund future acquisitions. 
 On June 20, 2024, the Company entered into the Amendment to the Credit Agreement, to provide for the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of 1.4 billion. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans replace or refinance in full all of the existing term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement (as in effect immediately prior to the Amendment), all as further set forth in the Amendment. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans mature on December 19, 2030. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) the forward-looking term rate based on Term SOFR plus 2.75 per annum or (y) an alternate base rate (which will be the highest of (i) the prime rate plus 0.5 per annum above the federal funds effective rate and (ii) Term SOFR plus 1.00 per annum (which shall not be less than 1.00 plus 1.75 per annum. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans amortize in equal quarterly installments of 0.25 of the aggregate original principal amount of the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans. Voluntary prepayments of the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans are permitted, in whole or in part, with prior notice, without premium or penalty (except a 1.00 call premium in the case of certain repricing events occurring prior to the sixth month anniversary of the effective date of the Amendment). 
 Capital Resources 
 Net working capital was approximately 460.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 372.0 million at December 31, 2023. 
 In addition to cash flows from operations and available cash, other sources of capital include amounts available on our Revolver as well as anticipated continued access to the capital markets. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 There have been no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our upcoming cash obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from those disclosed under Material Cash Requirements in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Summary 
 Broad economic factors, including recent changes in interest rates, inflation and supply chain risks and market volatility, could negatively affect our payor mix, increase the relative proportion of lower margin services we provide and reduce patient volumes, as well as diminish our ability to collect outstanding receivables. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts receivable will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations, requiring an increased level of working capital. 
 If general economic conditions, including recent changes in interest rates, inflation risk and market volatility, continue to deteriorate or remain uncertain for an extended period of time, our ability to access capital could be harmed, which could negatively affect our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt. 
 Based on our current level of operations, we believe cash flows from operations, available cash, available capacity on our Revolver and continued anticipated access to capital markets, will be adequate to meet our short-term (i.e., 12 months) and long-term (beyond 12 months) liquidity needs. 
 
 Certain Non-GAAP Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded from this non-GAAP metric are significant components in understanding and evaluating our financial performance. We believe such adjustments are appropriate, as the magnitude and frequency of such items can vary significantly and are not related to the assessment of normal operating performance. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to assess operating performance, make business decisions and allocate resources.

 0.7 1.2 (3.7) 7.7 Adjusted EBITDA 128.6 105.5 344.4 295.8 
 (1) This amount includes transaction and integration costs of 29.4 million and 12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This amount further includes start-up costs related to de novo surgical facilities of 2.1 million and 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 This amount includes transaction and integration costs of 66.1 million and 37.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This amount further includes start-up costs related to de novo surgical facilities of 5.1 million and 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 (2) This amount includes a litigation settlement loss of 0.5 million and 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This amount also includes other litigation costs of 1.1 million and 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 This amount includes a litigation settlements gain of 0.8 million and a loss of 8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This amount also includes other litigation costs of 2.3 million and 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes 4.4 million related to the impact of recent changes in Florida law regarding the use of letters of protection. 
 (3) For the three months ended September 30, 2024, this amount includes hurricane-related impacts. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, this amount includes estimates for the net impact of a cyber event. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, this amount includes hurricane-related impacts in the third quarter of 2024, net of insurance proceeds related to cyber event losses predominantly incurred in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, this amount includes estimates for the net impact of the aforementioned cyber event and losses from a divested business. 
 We use Credit Agreement EBITDA as a measure of liquidity and to determine our compliance under certain covenants pursuant to our Credit Agreement, as amended. Credit Agreement EBITDA is determined on a trailing twelve-month basis. We have included it because we believe that it provides investors with additional information about our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. Credit Agreement EBITDA is not a measurement of liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded from Credit Agreement EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating our liquidity. Our calculation of Credit Agreement EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 When we use the term "Credit Agreement EBITDA," we are referring to Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, further adjusted for acquisitions and synergies. These adjustments do not relate to our historical financial performance and instead relate to estimates compiled by management and calculated in conformance with the definition of "Consolidated EBITDA" used in the credit agreements governing our credit facilities.

Table of Contents 

The following table reconciles Credit Agreement EBITDA to cash flows from operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in millions and unaudited):

 (2.8) Acquisitions and synergies (2) 
 64.9 Credit Agreement EBITDA 551.6 
 (1) This amount includes estimates for the impact of hurricanes, a cyber event and losses from divested business that occurred in 2023. 
 (2) Represents impact of acquisitions as if each acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2023. Further this includes revenue and cost synergies from other business initiatives and de novo facilities and an adjustment for the effects of adopting the new lease accounting standard, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Credit Agreement, as amended. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are subject to market risk primarily from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing and cash management activities. We utilize a balanced mix of maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates. Additionally, we periodically enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Our interest rate swap and cap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. The interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. These derivatives have been recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair values. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income. 
 Our variable rate debt instruments are primarily indexed to the prime rate or SOFR. Without derivatives, interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of our fixed rate debt portfolio due to differences in market interest rates and the rates at the inception of the debt agreements. Based on our indebtedness and the effectiveness of our interest rate swap and cap agreements at September 30, 2024, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on our net earnings or cash flows in 2024. 
 For more information regarding our interest rate swap and cap agreements, please refer to Note 5. "Derivatives and Hedging Activities" of the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
