 Pursuant to such authority granted by the Company s stockholders, the Company s board of directors approved a
 one -for-
 1:20 reverse stock split (the "Reverse Stock Split of the Company s common stock and the filing of the Amendment to effectuate the Reverse Stock Split. The Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Reverse Stock Split became effective in accordance with the terms of the Amendment at
 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
 October 24, 2024 the "Effective Time ), and the Company s common stock opened for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on
 October 25, 2024 on a post-split basis, under the existing ticker symbol "AMIX but with a new CUSIP number
 05330T205. The Amendment provides that, at the Effective Time, every
 shares of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock will automatically be combined into
 one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in par value per share, which will remain
 .

The number of authorized shares of common stock will remain at
 million shares. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, proportionate adjustments will be made to the per share exercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all outstanding stock options, restricted stock unit awards, warrants and convertible notes, which will result in a proportional decrease in the number of shares of the Company s common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of such stock options, restricted stock unit awards, warrants and convertible notes and, in the case of stock options and warrants, a proportional increase in the exercise price of all such stock options and warrants. In addition, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Company s equity compensation plan immediately prior to the Effective Time will be reduced proportionately.

No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Any stockholder who would have been entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the process will be entitled to the rounding up of the fractional share to the nearest whole number. See Note
 7 for subsequent event regarding rounding shares.

The Reverse Stock Split has been retroactively adjusted throughout these interim financial statements and footnotes for all periods presented, including exercise prices and share data. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the Company reclassified approximately thousand between common stock par value and additional paid-in capital. 

million and 
 million, respectively, and had net cash flows used in operating activities of 
 million and 
 million, respectively. The Company had
 no revenues for the
 three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and an accumulated deficit of 
 million, working capital of 
 million and cash of 
 million as of
 September 30, 2024 . The Company does
 not expect to generate positive cash flows from operating activities in the near future.

The Company estimates its current cash resources are sufficient to fund its operations into but not beyond the second calendar quarter of 2025. The Company recognizes it will need to raise additional capital to continue to execute its business plan, including obtaining regulatory clearance for its products currently under development and commercializing and generating revenues from products under development. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that management will be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to the Company. A failure to raise sufficient capital, generate sufficient product revenues, control expenditures and regulatory matters, among other factors, will adversely impact the Company s ability to meet its financial obligations as they become due and payable and to achieve its intended business objectives. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to scale back its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

uncertain tax positions. The Company does not expect to pay any significant federal, state, or foreign income taxes in our fiscal year 2025 (ending March 31, 2025) as a result of the losses recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and the additional losses expected for the remainder of our fiscal year 2025 and cumulative net operating loss carryforwards. Accounting standards require the consideration of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some component or all of the benefits of deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 The Company recorded no income tax provision for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is . The Company estimates its annual effective tax rate at the end of each quarterly period. Jurisdictions with a projected loss for the year where no tax benefit can be recognized due to the valuation allowance could result in a higher or lower effective tax rate during a particular quarter depending on the mix and timing of actual earnings versus annual projections.

There were no changes to the valuation approaches or techniques used for Level 3 measurements. 
 
 Warrant Liabilities 
 
 As more fully detailed in Note 6 Related Party Transactions , on July 7, 2023, the Company entered into an Exclusive License Termination Agreement (the Termination Agreement with a licensee in exchange for the issuance, upon the closing of the Company s IPO within one year of the agreement s execution, of a warrant to purchase shares of the Company for a variable number of shares. 
 
 The fair value of the warrant liability has been estimated using a discounted cash flow model under various scenarios and used the probability-weighted expected return method PWERM comparing the probabilities of different outcomes. The outcomes considered included (i) the closing of a qualified financing as part of the Company s IPO at various points in time and (ii) the possibility of default whereby the licensee receives nothing. Key assumptions for the model were as follows for the initial measurement: 

Probability (2) 70 - 10 - 20 
 Payment (3) 0 0 - 8,000,000 00 
 Expected term (in years) (4) 0.48 - 0.98 

1 The initial discount rate was chosen based on private equity rates of return as described in the AICPA Practice Aid on Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity securities issued as compensation. For the recurring fair value measurement, the Company updated the discount rate based upon yield curves estimated to be similar in credit quality to the Company. The updated discount rate as of September 30, 2023 was ; 
 2 Scenario probability as of issuance and September 30, 2023 was based on timing expectations of management that a qualified offering occurring as of December 31, 2023 was estimated at 70 ; a qualified offering occurring as of June 30, 2024 was estimated at 10 ; and no qualified offering occurring was estimated at 20 ; 
 3 The warrant has a strike price, however, the strike price is low relative to the stock price, making the warrant value close to the value of a stock unit. The agreement has a fixed payment value of million, see Note 6 Related Party Transactions ; 
 4 For the subsequent recurring fair value measurements as of September 30, 2023 , the Company updated the expected term to a range between - years. 

million in unsecured, non-interest bearing convertible promissory notes (the Notes and accompanying warrants (the Bridge Financing Warrants (collectively, the Bridge Offering that will mature on December 31, 2025. The Notes provided that, on the closing date of the IPO, the outstanding principal would be automatically converted into common stock at the conversion price of . Each dollar in principal amount of Notes purchased were accompanied by a five -year Bridge Financing Warrant to purchase approximately shares of Common stock with an exercise price of per share. The Company records the Bridge Financing Warrants as a discount to the Notes. 
 
 The Bridge Financing Warrants can be exercised from the date of Notes issuance through the five -year anniversary of the issuance of the Notes. The shares issuable pursuant to the Notes and Bridge Financing Warrants have a -day lock-up after the Company s IPO. Thereafter, the foregoing lock-up agreement will cease to apply to of the purchased shares each month for a period of four months. The Note holders are not permitted to convert their Notes when the holders or any of their affiliates would beneficially own in excess of of the Company s common stock after such conversion. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, the Company received proceeds of , of million of Notes executed from the Bridge Offering, which would convert into shares of common stock. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company received proceeds of million of Notes executed from the Bridge Offering, which would convert into shares of common stock. The Company s effective interest rate for the Notes is due to the amortization of the discount stemming from the issuance of the Bridge Financing Warrants. On January 26, 2024, we consummated our initial public offering IPO ). In connection with the closing of the IPO, a portion of our convertible notes were converted into shares of our common stock. Upon the closing of the IPO, certain notes were to be automatically converted according to their terms into our common stock to the extent and provided that certain holders of these notes are not permitted to convert such notes to the extent that the holders or any of its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of of our common stock after such conversion. Due to this limitation, principal representing million, or shares, of these notes remains outstanding. 

The table below summarizes the Company s outstanding convertible notes payable as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands). 

Warrants 
 
 The Company issued the Notes with detachable warrants for the purchase of shares of the Company s common stock. The Company utilized a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of each Bridge Offering Warrant. The key inputs to the Monte Carlo simulation used to determine the fair value of each warrant include, the Company s stock price fair value which was determined through a back solve calculation such that the stock price results in the average total value of the Notes and the Bridge Offering Warrants being equal to the cash proceeds received, volatility based on a selection of publicly held peer companies of , expected term of years, risk free rate of , discount rate of and a discount for lack of marketability of . 
 
 During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recorded less than million in interest expense, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discount. Due to the timing of the receipt of proceeds, the Company did not incur interest expense during the three and six months ended September 30, 2023.

 On November 29, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors and applicable shareholders approved to amend and restate the Company s certificate of incorporation and increased the authorized shares to shares of common stock, with a par value of 0.001 per share, and shares of preferred stock, with a par value of per share. The specific rights of the preferred stock shall be determined by the Board of Directors.

 On September 9, 2023, the Board approved a Bridge Offering. See Note 3 Convertible Notes Payable for additional detail as these notes are convertible into common stock. 
 
 Stock Plan and Stock Options 
 
 In June 2023, the Company adopted, and the Company s shareholders approved, the Autonomix Medical, Inc. 2023 Stock Plan (the Plan ). The Plan is a stock-based compensation plan that provides for discretionary grants of stock options, stock awards and stock unit awards to key employees, non-employee directors, and consultants, subject to certain individual threshold limitations. The Plan provides for up to shares to be issued. Shares that are surrendered because of forfeiture, expiration, termination, or cancellation are available for re-issuance. 
 
 In August 2023, the Plan was amended to allow for an automatic increase of the available shares for issuance, whereby on the 1st of each fiscal year, beginning on April 1, 2024 and ending on (and including) April 1, 2033 in an amount equal to five percent of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the March 31st immediately preceding the applicable date. However, the Board may act prior to the automatic increase of a given year to provide that there will be no increase for such year, or that the increase for such year will be a lesser number of shares of Common Stock. On April 1, 2024, the Plan was increased by shares.

During the six months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company granted certain individuals options to purchase shares of common stock with a contractual term that vests annually over four years on the anniversary date. The options had an aggregate grant date fair value of million that was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Variables used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model included the following: 1 fair value of common stock on the measurement date; 2 discount rate ranging from to based on the daily yield curve rates for U.S. Treasury obligations, 3 expected life ranging of years based on the simplified method (vesting plus contractual term divided by two and 4 expected volatility ranging from to based on the historical volatility of comparable companies' stock. 

All options issued and outstanding are being amortized over their respective vesting periods. The unrecognized compensation expense at September 30, 2024 was million. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recorded stock-based compensation - option expense of million in general and administrative expense and less than million in research and development expense, respectively and million in general and administrative expense and less than million in research and development expense, respectively. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recorded stock-based compensation - option expense of million in general and administrative expense. 
 
 License Agreement 
 
 On July 10, 2024, we entered into a license agreement (the Agreement with RF Innovations, Inc. RFI ), a privately held medical technology company, to license products utilizing RFI s intellectual property related to its Apex 6 Radiofrequency Generator (the Licensed Products ). The Apex 6 Generator is a United States Food and Drug Administration FDA cleared ablation technology designed to lesion neural tissue for pain management in the peripheral nervous system. Pursuant to the Agreement, RFI granted us a perpetual non-exclusive worldwide royalty free fully paid license related to the Licensed Products, provided that the license did not include the right to sell certain products to customers for the treatment of spine pain. In connection with the Agreement, we issued RFI unregistered shares of our common stock as consideration for the license. The Company determined that the fair value of the shares granted was million, which represented its stock price on the date of the Agreement less a of less than million for a discount for lack of marketability DLOM ). The Company concluded a discount for lack of marketability was appropriate as the shares are subject to an initial lock-up period of six -months until they are eligible for registration pursuant to SEC Rule 144 followed by restrictions that allow for a maximum of of total shares to be sold within a 30 -day period. The DLOM effectively reflects the value of an average strike put option relative to our stock price and was calculated based on the Finnerty average put model. The Company concluded that the licensed technology qualified as a research and development expense pursuant to ASC Topic 730, Research and Development , as the Company does not have an alternative future use for the technology and the Company does not have a plan to otherwise monetize the Licensed Products. The Company recognized million in Research and Development expense in its condensed consolidated statement of income for the three and six -months ended September 30, 2024. The Agreement provides RFI the right to terminate the license if we breach any representation, warranty or covenant contained in the Agreement, subject to any relevant cure periods, or if we are subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency event.

On December 21, 2021, the Company entered into a perpetual, worldwide, exclusive license agreement (the License or License Agreement with a company controlled by a significant stockholder of the Company (the Licensee ). The License allows the Licensee to use certain intellectual property and technology related to the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular conditions held by the Company. Upon 90 days following the completion of an initial public offering or special purpose acquisition company transaction, the Licensee may enter into sublicenses of the licensed intellectual property and technology. 
 
 On July 7, 2023, the Company and the Licensee entered into an Exclusive License Termination Agreement (the Termination Agreement in exchange for the issuance, upon the closing of the Company s initial public offering within one year of the agreement s execution, of a warrant to purchase shares of the Company for a variable number of shares. The variable number of shares issued was based upon a fixed value of million divided by the price per share in the offering. The warrants were exercisable at a price of per share and may be exercised any time after the issuance date, subject to a beneficial ownership limitation, and expired five years from the original issuance. The warrants provided voting rights, dividend rights, and other rights of a shareholder prior to exercise. The shares underlying the warrant were subject to a lockup agreement for a period of six months after the closing of the offering with respect to of the shares issued and twelve months after the closing of the offering for the remainder of the shares. 
 
 On January 29, 2024, we issued a warrant to purchase shares (the Warrant pursuant to the Termination Agreement with Impulse Medical, Inc. ("Impulse"). which replaced the July 2023 warrants . The warrants are exercisable at a price of per share and may be exercised any time after the issuance date, subject to a beneficial ownership limitation, and expires five years from the original issuance. The warrants provide voting rights, dividend rights, and other rights of a shareholder prior to exercise. The shares underlying the Warrant are subject to a lockup agreement for a period of six months after the closing of the IPO with respect to of the shares issued and twelve months after the closing of the IPO for the remainder of the shares. In connection with the Termination Agreement, the Company agreed to register the resale of the shares of common stock underlying the Warrant upon a notice of 20 business days by the Warrant holder. 
 
 The completion of the Company s IPO fixed the number of warrant shares issuable and the Company re-classified the Warrant to additional-paid in capital as it met the requirements for equity classification. Upon reclassification, the Company valued the warrant at million, which represented the fair value of the shares issued on that date. 

shares of common stock. Prior to the Company's required announcement regarding the Reverse Stock Split on October 22, 2024, the Company estimates there were approximately shareholders of record. The Company does not believe the number of shares being requested is correct based on the historical number of shareholders of its common stock and is aware of similar occurrences in recent months for other companies completing a Reverse Stock Split. As such, the Company has begun an inquiry into the calculations set forth in the request. During the pendency of this inquiry, the Company does not intend to issue any shares in connection with the fractional shares being requested.

 Overview 
 
 We are a development stage medical device development company focused on advancing innovative technologies for sensing and treating disorders relating to the nervous system. Our first-in-class technology platform includes a catheter-based microchip-enabled array that can detect and differentiate neural signals with a high degree of sensitivity as demonstrated in animal studies. We calculate sensitivity in units of minimum signal detection voltage in micro volts (uV) time area of the electrode (square millimeters). It is a combined measure that is related to the signal resolving power and spatial resolution of the system. For the BSC Orion, the nearest device on the market, the metrics are 10uV for signal detection levels, and roughly 0.4mm by 0.5mm for the electrode dimensions. For the Autonomix device, the metrics are 
 
 We are initially developing our technology for patients with pancreatic cancer, a condition that can cause debilitating pain and needs a more effective solution. However, we believe our technology constitutes a platform with the potential to address dozens of indications in a range of areas including chronic pain management from all causes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and a wide range of other nerve-related disorders. 
 
 Our development efforts can be divided into to two sub parts: sensing and treatment, where sensing is focused on identifying neuronal activity that may be associated with a disorder with enough precision to enable targeted treatment. While the treatment may vary depending on the disorder, in our initial indications this will involve energy-based ablation (deliberate tissue damage, also referred to as denervation) intended to stop unwanted neuronal activity. 
 
 Our sensing catheter has already been developed sufficiently to demonstrate in animal models successful identification of a signal from a specific nerve before ablation and confirmation of termination of the signal from the treated nerve after ablation. We are now in the process of improving the assembly of this catheter to meet the standards required for human use. In parallel with this effort, we are conducting our first-in-human demonstration of transvascular ablation (without the use of our sensing technology) to relieve pain associated with pancreatic cancer. Once these two efforts are completed, we plan to bring sensing and treatment together in a pivotal clinical trial to enable the commercial launch of our technology. As stated above, we are a development stage company and there is no guarantee that the results of any trials will produce positive results or that the results will support our claims.

Recent Developments 
 
 On July 10, 2024, we entered into a license agreement (the Agreement with RF Innovations, Inc. RFI ), a privately held medical technology company, to license products utilizing RFI s intellectual property related to its Apex 6 Radiofrequency Generator (the Licensed Products ). The Apex 6 Generator is a United States Food and Drug Administration FDA cleared ablation technology designed to lesion neural tissue for pain management in the peripheral nervous system. Pursuant to the Agreement, RFI granted us a perpetual non-exclusive worldwide royalty free fully paid license related to the Licensed Products, provided that the license did not include the right to sell certain products to customers for the treatment of spine pain. The Agreement provides RFI the right to terminate the license if we breach any representation, warranty or covenant contained in the Agreement, subject to any relevant cure periods, or if we are subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency event. In connection with the Agreement, we issued RFI 12,500 unregistered shares of our common stock as consideration for the license. We determined that the fair value of the shares granted was 0.1 million, which represented our stock price on the date of the Agreement less a 25.6 of less than 0.1 million for a discount for lack of marketability DLOM ). We concluded a discount for lack of marketability was appropriate as the shares are subject to an initial lock-up period of six-months until they are eligible for registration pursuant to SEC Rule 144 followed by restrictions that allow for a maximum of 10 of total shares to be sold within a 30-day period. The DLOM effectively reflects the value of an average strike put option relative to our stock price and was calculated based on the Finnerty average put model. We concluded that the licensed technology qualified as a research and development expense pursuant to ASC Topic 730, Research and Development , as we do not have an alternative future use for the technology and we do not have a plan to otherwise monetize the Licensed Products. We recognized 0.1 million in Research and Development expense in our condensed consolidated statement of income for the three and six-months ended September 30, 2024. The Agreement provides RFI the right to terminate the license if we breach any representation, warranty or covenant contained in the Agreement, subject to any relevant cure periods, or if we are subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency event. 
 
 We held our annual meeting of stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") on October 17, 2024, in that Annual Meeting, among other items, our stockholders approved an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the "Amendment to effect the reverse stock split at a ratio in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-50, with such ratio to be determined in the discretion of our board of directors and with such reverse stock split to be effected at such time and date, if at all, as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion prior to the one-year anniversary of the Annual Meeting. 

Pursuant to such authority granted by our stockholders, our board of directors approved a one-for-twenty (1:20) reverse stock split (the "Reverse Stock Split of our common stock and the filing of the Amendment to effectuate the Reverse Stock Split. The Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Reverse Stock Split became effective in accordance with the terms of the Amendment at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on October 24, 2024 (the "Effective Time ), and our common stock opened for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on October 25, 2024 on a post-split basis, under the existing ticker symbol "AMIX but with a new CUSIP number 05330T205. The Amendment provides that, at the Effective Time, every twenty shares of our issued and outstanding common stock will automatically be combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in par value per share, which will remain 0.001.

On November 1, 2024, we received notice from the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation ("DTCC") on behalf of the brokerage firms that hold the shares of our common stock held in street name , that in connection with the foregoing rounding of shares we would need to issue 271,846 shares of common stock. Prior to our required announcement regarding the Reverse Stock Split on October 22, 2024, we estimate there were approximately 4,800 shareholders of record. We do not believe the number of shares being requested is correct based on the historical number of shareholders of our common stock and are aware of similar occurrences in recent months for other companies completing a Reverse Stock Split. As such, we have begun an inquiry into the calculations set forth in the request. During the pendency of this inquiry, we do not intend to issue any shares in connection with the fractional shares being requested.

General and Administrative Expense 
 
 General and administrative expense was 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.8 million for the same period in 2023. This 0.9 million increase was driven primarily by increases in officer and employee compensation and benefits of 0.4 million, as we expanded our management team, stock-based compensation of 0.2 million, insurance expense of 0.1 million, franchise tax of 0.1 million and other expenses of 0.1 million. 
 
 General and administrative expense was 3.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 million for the same period in 2023. This 2.2 million increase was driven primarily by increases in officer and employee compensation and benefits of 1.0 million, as we expanded our management team, stock-based compensation of 0.6 million, legal and professional fees of 0.2 million, insurance expense of 0.2 million, franchise tax of 0.2 million, and board of directors compensation of 0.1 million, offset by a decrease in advertising expense of 0.1 million. 
 
 Research and Development Expense 
 
 Research and development expense was 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.5 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Research and development expense was 2.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.8 million for the same period in 2023 
 
 The increases in research and development expenses during the current year was mainly attributed to our clinical trial and product development costs. We expect to incur increased research and development costs in the future as we continue with our clinical trial. 
 
 Interest expense 
 
 For the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, we had interest expense of less than 0.1 million, respectively, related to the amortization of debt discount. Interest expense was 0 during the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 as there was no comparable expense in the prior period. 
 
 Interest income 
 
 For the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, we had interest income of less than 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively. Interest income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 was less than 0.1 million, respectively, due to relatively lower cash balances.

Table of Contents 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 On September 30, 2024, we had cash of 5.2 million, and working capital of 4.1 million. We have historically funded our operations from proceeds from debt and equity sales. We estimate our current cash resources are sufficient to fund our operations into but not beyond the second calendar quarter of 2025. 
 
 Our plan of operations is primarily focused on developing our initial product, which is currently in the proof-of-concept stage at this time. We are initially focusing on the treatment of pain associated with pancreatic cancer and we have designed our commercialization efforts around this as our first proposed indication for use. 
 
 We will need to raise additional capital to meet our obligations and execute our business plan. We estimate that we will require additional financing of approximately 40 million to fund our operations to commercialization of our first indication. The timing and costs of clinical trials are difficult to predict and trial plans may change in response to evolving circumstances and as such the foregoing estimates may prove to be inaccurate. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds, we will be required to develop and implement an alternative plan to further extend payables, reduce overhead or scale back our business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful. The Company recognizes it will need to raise additional capital to continue to execute its business plan, including obtaining regulatory clearance for its products currently under development and commercializing and generating revenues from products under development. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that management will be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to the Company. A failure to raise sufficient capital, generate sufficient product revenues, control expenditures and regulatory matters, among other factors, will adversely impact the Company s ability to meet its financial obligations as they become due and payable and to achieve its intended business objectives. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to scale back its operations. 
 
 Summary of Cash Flows 
 
 Cash used in operating activities 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 3.4 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of a net loss of 5.5 million and a decrease in operating assets of 0.6 million and an increase in operating liabilities of 0.5 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities included sources of cash from a decrease in other current assets of 0.6 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 0.1 million and 0.4 million, respectively. The decrease in other current assets was driven primarily by the receipt of funds from our marketing partner that were a holdback from our IPO and the amortization of prepaid insurance costs. The increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses were driven primarily by increases in research and development expenses and accruing for franchise tax. Non-cash items consisted of stock-based compensation of 0.8 million, depreciation and amortization of 0.1 million and issuance of common stock, net of discount for lack of marketability of 0.1 million. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 5 thousand for the six months ended September 30, 2024 related to the purchase of computer hardware and software. 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 0 for the six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 3.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 consisting of 2.8 million from the sale of common stock and 0.4 million from the issuance of convertible debt. We also paid 0.1 million in offering costs related to our IPO. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
 None. 
 
 Employment Arrangements 
 
 We have agreements with key employees to provide certain benefits, including salary and other wage-related benefits, in the event of termination. In addition, the Company has adopted a severance policy for certain key members of executive management to provide certain benefits, including salary and other wage-related benefits, in the event of termination. In total, these benefits would amount to a range of 1.1 million to 1.6 million using the rate of compensation in effect at September 30, 2024.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 
 The financial statements in this quarterly report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto. We consider critical accounting policies to be those that require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements, including the following: work performed but not yet billed by contract manufacturers, engineers and research organizations, warrant liability and the valuation of equity related instruments. Management relies on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable in making its judgments and estimates. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
 
 Management believes its application of accounting policies, and the estimates inherently required therein, are reasonable. These accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. 
 
 Our accounting policies are more fully described under the heading Description of the Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on May 31, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO ), who serves as our principal executive officer, and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), who serves as our principal accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 Under the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2024, of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon such evaluation and due to both the limited staffing of the Company at its early stage of development and the existence of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
 
 A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As previously disclosed in the Annual Report in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on May 31, 2024, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was, and continues to be, ineffective as of September 30, 2024 due to material weaknesses in our internal controls arising from a lack of segregation of duties; general technology controls; and financial statement reporting. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of certain events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.

Table of Contents 

Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to maintain effective segregation of duties on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and has concluded that the control deficiency represents a material weakness. As previously disclosed, in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, we hired new executive officers and management with significant financial and accounting experience in both private and public companies. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, an additional experienced staff was hired in the accounting and finance department. We have added the use of additional consulting firms to assist with significant and complex accounting transactions and to assist with our segregation of duties and create a more structured financial statement reporting environment. Experienced personnel will be hired in the accounting and finance department and appropriate consultants will be upgraded as soon as it becomes economically feasible and sustainable. In addition, management has added additional mitigating controls with regards to cash disbursements; changes were made in our authorization processes to improve segregation of duties; and we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure our financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that our employees are working remotely. We are continually monitoring and assessing the situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness. 
 
 Other than as described above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent calendar quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we may be involved in legal proceedings, the outcomes of which may not be determinable. The results of litigation are inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and result in diversion of significant resources. We are not able to estimate an aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses for those legal matters for which losses are not probable and estimable. We have insurance policies covering potential losses where such coverage is cost effective. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors as found in the Annual Report in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on May 31, 2024. 
 
 The risks described in our Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. There have been no material changes to our risk factors from those set forth in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on May 31, 2024 aside from the following: 
 
 We completed a reverse stock split on October 24, 2024 in an effort to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and we cannot predict the effect that such reverse stock split will have on the market price for shares of our common stock. 
 
 Our board of directors approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of our common stock, which became effective at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on October 24, 2024. We cannot predict the effect that the reverse stock split will have on the market price for shares of our common stock, and the history of similar reverse stock splits for companies in like circumstances has varied. Some investors may have a negative view of a reverse stock split. Even if the reverse stock split has a positive effect on the market price for shares of our common stock, performance of our business and financial results, general economic conditions and the market perception of our business, and other adverse factors which may not be in our control could lead to a decrease in the price of our common stock following the reverse stock split. 
 
 Furthermore, even if the reverse stock split does result in an increased market price per share of our common stock, the market price per share following the reverse stock split may not increase in proportion to the reduction of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding before the implementation of the reverse stock split. Accordingly, even with an increased market price per share, the total market capitalization of shares of our common stock after a reverse stock split could be lower than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split. Also, even if there is an initial increase in the market price per share of our common stock after a reverse stock split, the market price many not remain at that level. 
 
 If the market price of shares of our common stock declines following the reverse stock split, the percentage decline as an absolute number and as a percentage of our overall market capitalization may be greater than would occur in the absence of the reverse stock split due to decreased liquidity in the market for our common stock. Accordingly, the total market capitalization of our common stock following the reverse stock split could be lower than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split. 
 
 We may be required to issue up to 271,846 shares of common stock in connection with the reverse stock split we completed on October 24, 2024, and we may be subject to potential liability if it is determined that we are required to issue such shares and we fail to issue such shares on a timely basis. 
 
 On October 24, 2024, we completed a one-for-twenty reverse stock split of our common stock. In connection with the approval of the reverse stock split, we agreed that no fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split and that we would issue one full share of the post-reverse stock split common stock to any shareholder who would have been entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the process. On November 1, 2024, we received notice from DTCC on behalf of the brokerage firms that hold the shares of our common stock held in street name that in connection with the foregoing rounding of shares we would need to issue 271,846 shares of common stock. 
 
 We do not believe the number of shares being requested is correct based on the historical number of shareholders of our common stock and have begun an inquiry into the calculations set forth in the request. During the pendency of this inquiry, we do not expect to issue any shares in connection with the fractional shares being requested. We may face potential liability for our failure to issue the shares of common stock if it is determined that we are required to issue such shares. In addition, our shareholders will be diluted to the extent of any issuances of shares of common stock in connection with the foregoing. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 On July 10, 2024, we entered into a license agreement (the Agreement with RF Innovations, Inc. RFI ), a privately held medical technology company, to license products utilizing RFI s intellectual property related to its Apex 6 Radiofrequency Generator (the Licensed Products ). The Apex 6 Generator is a United States Food and Drug Administration FDA cleared ablation technology designed to lesion neural tissue for pain management in the peripheral nervous system. Pursuant to the Agreement, RFI granted us a perpetual non-exclusive worldwide royalty free fully paid license related to the Licensed Products, provided that the license did not include the right to sell certain products to customers for the treatment of spine pain. In connection with the Agreement, we issued RFI 12,500 unregistered shares of our common stock as consideration for the license. The Agreement provides RFI the right to terminate the license if we breach any representation, warranty or covenant contained in the Agreement, subject to any relevant cure periods, or if we are subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency event. 
 
 The securities were issued in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for the offer and sale of securities not involving a public offering, and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.
