SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions
and on information currently available to management, and which statements involve substantial risk and uncertainties. All statements
contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future operating
results and financial position, our business strategy and plans, market growth and trends, and objectives for future operations such
as our ability to achieve in excess of 100 annual unit growth rate over the next three
to five years , our hope to generate future comparable restaurant sales growth ,
our plan to drive high profitability, and our intention to heighten brand awareness are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking
statements because they contain words such as may, will, should, expects, plans, 
 anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, 
 believes, estimates, predicts, potential, or continue or the negative
of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. 

These
risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the risk that we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy if
we are unable to identify appropriate sites for restaurant locations, expand in existing and new markets, obtain favorable lease terms,
attract guests to our restaurants or hire and retain personnel; the risk that we may not be able to maintain or improve our comparable
restaurant sales growth; that the restaurant industry is a highly competitive industry with many competitors; that our limited number
of restaurants, the significant expense associated with opening new restaurants, and the unit volumes of our new restaurants makes us
susceptible to significant fluctuations in our results of operations; that we have incurred operating losses and may not be profitable
in the future; the risk that our plans to maintain and increase liquidity may not be successful; that we depend on our senior management
team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more key personnel or an inability to attract, hire, integrate and retain highly
skilled personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations; that our operating results
and growth strategies will be closely tied to the success of our future franchise partners and we will have limited control with respect
to their operations; the risk that we may face negative publicity or damage to our reputation, which could arise from concerns regarding
food safety and foodborne illness or other matters; that minimum wage increases and mandated employee benefits could cause a significant
increase in our labor costs; that events or circumstances could cause the termination or limitation of our rights to certain intellectual
property critical to our business that is licensed from Yoshiharu Holdings Co., or that we could face infringements on our intellectual
property rights and be unable to protect our brand name, trademarks and other intellectual property rights; that challenging economic
conditions may affect our business by adversely impacting numerous items that include, but are not limited to: consumer confidence and
discretionary spending, the future cost and availability of credit and the operations of our third-party vendors and other service providers;
the risk that we, or our point of sale and restaurant management platform partners, may fail to secure guests confidential, personally
identifiable, debit card or credit card information or other private data relating to our employees or us; and the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, or a similar public health threat, on global capital and financial markets, general economic conditions in the United States,
and our business and operations. 

You
should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe
may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking
statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the
section titled Risk Factors in the Company s recently filed registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-262330).
We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to conform
such statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law.

GLOBAL CO. 

NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The
Company owns several restaurants specializing in Japanese ramen and other Japanese cuisines. The Company offers a variety of Japanese
ramens, rice bowls, and appetizers. Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms Yoshiharu we, 
 us, our and the Company refer collectively to Yoshiharu and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. 

Prior
to September 30, 2021, the Yoshiharu business (the Business consisted of the first seven separate entities listed above
(collectively, the Entities ), each wholly owned by James Chae Mr. Chae ), and each holding one (1) store,
except for JJ, which held two stores and the Business s intellectual property (the IP ). Effective October 2021, JJ
transferred the IP to Mr. Chae. Effective October 2021, Mr. Chae contributed of the equity interests in each of the Entities to
Yoshiharu Holdings Co., a California corporation Holdings ), for purposes of consolidating the Business operations into
a single entity. Mr. Chae was issued an aggregate shares in Holdings, which reflected the aggregate number of shares originally
issued to Mr. Chae by the Entities, in exchange for of each Entity (on a 1 for 1 share exchange basis). In addition, effective October

shareholdings in Holdings up to an aggregate shares. 

On
December 9, 2021, Yoshiharu completed a share exchange agreement whereby Mr. Chae, the sole stockholder of Holdings, received 
shares of Yoshiharu, representing of issued shares at that time, and Yoshiharu received all of the shares of Holdings. This recapitalization
was accounted for in accordance with the Transactions Between Entities Under Common Control subsections of Accounting Standards
Codification ASC 805-50, Business Combinations, which requires that the receiving entity recognize the net assets received
at their historical carrying amounts. A common-control transaction has no effect on the parent s consolidated financial statements.
No value was ascribed to the shares issued for the transfer of the IP since the only relevance of the aggregate number of shares issued
to Mr. Chae in Holdings was to effect the 1 for 1 share exchange with Yoshiharu upon its incorporation in Delaware. ASC 805-50 also prescribes
that, if the recognition of the net assets results in a change in the reporting entity, the receiving entity presents the
transfer in its separate financial statements retrospectively. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations
that are reflected in these consolidated financial statements are those of the subsidiaries and are recorded at the historical cost basis
of the subsidiaries.

additional shares of Class A common stock were issued and a total of 
shares of Class A common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2023. The Reverse Stock Split affected all stockholders uniformly
and did not alter any stockholder s percentage interest in the Company s outstanding Common Stock, except for
adjustments that may result from the treatment of fractional shares. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock of the Company
and number of authorized, issued, and outstanding shares of the preferred stock of the Company were not changed.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: 

As
of December 31, 2023, the Company had available net operating loss carryovers of approximately . Per the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act (TCJA) implemented in 2018, the two-year carryback provision was removed and now allows for an indefinite carryforward period. The
carryforwards are limited to 80 of each subsequent year s net income. As a result, net operating loss may be applied against future
taxable income and expires at various dates subject to certain limitations. The Company has a deferred tax asset arising substantially
from the benefits of such net operating loss deduction and has recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of this deferred tax
asset since it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. 

The
Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and California and is subject to income tax examinations by federal
tax authorities for tax year ended 2018 and later and subject to California authorities for tax year ended 2017 and later. The Company
currently is not under examination by any tax authority. The Company s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain
tax positions as income tax expense. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has no accrued interest or penalties
related to uncertain tax positions. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cumulative net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately .

 Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ending December 31, 2023. 

Overview
of Yoshiharu 

Yoshiharu
is a fast-growing Japanese restaurant operator and was borne out of the idea of introducing the modernized Japanese dining experience
to customers all over the world. Specializing in Japanese ramen, Yoshiharu gained recognition as a leading ramen restaurant in Southern
California within nine months of our 2016 debut and has continued to expand our top-notch restaurant service across Southern California,
currently owning and operating 14 restaurant stores with an additional 3 restaurant stores under construction/development/acquisition
as of September 30, 2024. 

We
take pride in our warm, hearty, smooth, and rich bone broth, which is slowly boiled for over 12 hours. Customers can taste and experience
supreme quality and deep flavors. Combining the broth with the fresh, savory, and highest-quality ingredients, Yoshiharu serves the perfect,
ideal ramen, as well as offers customers a wide variety of sushi rolls, bento menu and other favorite Japanese cuisine. Our acclaimed
signature Tonkotsu Black Ramen has become a customer favorite with its slow cooked pork bone broth and freshly made, tender chashu (braised
pork belly). 

Our
mission is to bring our Japanese ramen and cuisine to the mainstream, by providing a meal that customers find comforting. Since the inception
of the business, we have been making our own ramen broth and other key ingredients such as pork chashu and flavored eggs from scratch,
whereby upholding the quality and taste of our foods, including the signature texture and deep, rich flavor of our handcrafted broth.
Moreover, we believe that slowly cooking the bone broth makes it high in collagen and rich in nutrients. Yoshiharu also strives to present
food that is not only healthy, but also affordable. We feed, entertain and delight our customers, with our active kitchens and bustling
dining rooms providing happy hours, student and senior discounts, and special holiday events. As a result of our vision, customers can
comfortably enjoy our food in a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. 

We
operate in a large and rapidly growing market. We believe the consumer appetite for Asian cuisine is widespread across many demographics
and grants us the opportunity to expand in both existing and new U.S. markets, as well as internationally.

Our
Growth Strategies 

Pursue
New Restaurant Development. 

We
have pursued a disciplined new corporate owned growth strategy. Having expanded our concept and operating model across varying restaurant
sizes and geographies, we plan to leverage our expertise opening new restaurants to fill in existing markets and expand into new geographies.
While we currently aim to achieve in excess of 100 annual unit growth rate over the next three to five years, we cannot predict the
time period of which we can achieve any level of restaurant growth or whether we will achieve this level of growth at all. Our ability
to achieve new restaurant growth is impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties beyond our control, including but not limited to
landlord delays; competition in existing and new markets, including competition for restaurant sites; and the lack of development and
overall decrease in commercial real estate due to macroeconomic decline. We believe there is a significant opportunity to employ this
strategy to open additional restaurants in our existing markets and in new markets with similar demographics and retail environments. 

Deliver
Consistent Comparable Restaurant Sales Growth . 

We
have achieved positive comparable restaurant sales growth in recent periods. We believe we will be able to generate future comparable
restaurant sales growth by growing traffic through increased brand awareness, consistent delivery of a satisfying dining experience,
new menu offerings, and restaurant renovations. We will continue to manage our menu and pricing as part of our overall strategy to drive
traffic and increase average check. We are also exploring initiatives to grow sales of alcoholic beverages at our restaurants, including
the potential of a larger format restaurant with a sake bar concept. In addition to the strategies stated above, we expect to initiate
sales of franchises in 2025. 

Increase
Profitability . 

We
have invested in our infrastructure and personnel, which we believe positions us to continue to scale our business operations. As we
continue to grow, we expect to drive higher profitability both at a restaurant-level and corporate-level
 by taking advantage of our increasing buying power with suppliers and leveraging our existing support infrastructure. Additionally,
we believe we will be able to optimize labor costs at existing restaurants as our restaurant base matures and AUV s increase. We
believe that as our restaurant base grows, our general and administrative costs will increase at a slower rate than our sales. 

Heighten
Brand Awareness . 

We
intend to continue to pursue targeted local marketing efforts and plan to increase our investment in advertising. We also are exploring
the development of instant ramen noodles which we would distribute through retail channels. We intend to explore partnerships with grocery
retailers to provide small-format Yoshiharu kiosks in stores to promote a limited selection of Yoshiharu cuisine. 

Experienced
Management Team Dedicated to Growth . 

Our
team is led by experienced and passionate senior management who are committed to our mission. We are led by our Chief Executive Officer,
James Chae. Mr. Chae founded Yoshiharu in 2016 and leads a team of talented professionals with deep financial, operational, culinary,
and real estate experience. 

Recent Developments 

On October 31, 2024 we opened a new restaurant in San Clemente, CA, bringing the number of locations to 15 with 2
additional locations under construction. We believe this new opening will strengthen our business and further add to our presence in the
southern California dining scene.

Components
of Our Results of Operations 

Revenues.
 Revenues represent sales of food and beverages in restaurants. Restaurant sales in a given period are directly impacted by the
number of restaurants we operate and comparable restaurant sales growth. 

Food
and beverage. Food and beverage costs are variable in nature, change with sales volume and are influenced by menu mix and subject
to increases or decreases based on fluctuations in commodity costs. Other important factors causing fluctuations in food and beverage
costs include seasonality and restaurant-level management of food waste. Food and beverage costs are a substantial expense and are expected
to grow proportionally as our sales grow. 

Labor.
 Labor includes all restaurant-level management and hourly labor costs, including wages, employee benefits and payroll taxes.
Similar to the food and beverage costs that we incur, labor and related expenses are expected to grow proportionally as our sales increase.
Factors that influence fluctuations in our labor and related expenses include minimum wage and payroll tax legislation, the frequency
and severity of workers compensation claims, healthcare costs and the performance of our restaurants. 

Rent
and utilities. Rent and utilities include rent for all restaurant locations and related taxes.

Key
Performance Indicators 

In
assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and performance measures. The key measures for determining
how our business is performing include sales, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-level Operating Profit, Restaurant-level Operating
Profit margin, Average Unit Volumes AUVs ), comparable restaurant sales performance, and the number of restaurant openings. 

Revenue 

Revenue
represents sales of food and beverages in restaurants, as shown in our statements of income. Several factors affect our restaurant sales
in any given period including the number of restaurants in operation, guest traffic and average check. 

EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA 

EBITDA
is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted
EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, non-cash lease expense and asset disposals, closure costs and restaurant
impairments, as well as certain items, such as employee retention credit, litigation accrual, and certain executive transition costs,
that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales.
EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures which are intended as supplemental measures of our performance and are neither required
by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to management and
investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and operating results. However, these measures
may not provide a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company as a whole and such measures should be reviewed in conjunction
with our GAAP financial results. 

27 

We
believe that the use of EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating
results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial
measures to investors. However, you should be aware when evaluating EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA that in the future we may incur expenses
similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as
an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not
be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA
in the same fashion. 

Because
of these limitations, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated
in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA, and Adjusted
EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on
any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 

The
following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:

Restaurant-level
Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution Margin 

Restaurant-level
Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required
by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin provide
useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and
operating results. We expect Restaurant-level Contribution to increase in proportion to the number of new restaurants we open and our
comparable restaurant sales growth. 

We
present Restaurant-level Contribution because it excludes the impact of general and administrative expenses, which are not incurred at
the restaurant-level. We also use Restaurant-level Contribution to measure operating performance and returns from opening new restaurants.
Restaurant- level Contribution margin allows us to evaluate the level of Restaurant-level Contribution generated from sales. 

However,
you should be aware that Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin are financial measures which are not
indicative of overall results for the Company, and Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin do not accrue
directly to the benefit of stockholders because of corporate-level expenses excluded from such measures. 

In
addition, when evaluating Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin, you should be aware that in the future
we may incur expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed
as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Restaurant-level Contribution
and Restaurant- level Contribution margin may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because
all companies may not calculate Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin in the same fashion. Restaurant-level
Contribution and Restaurant- level Contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider it in isolation
or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

Average
Unit Volumes (AUVs) 

Average
Unit Volumes or AUVs consist of the average annual sales of all restaurants that have been open for 3 months or
longer at the end of the period presented. AUVs are calculated by dividing (x) annual sales for the year presented for all such restaurants
by (y) the total number of restaurants in that base. We make fractional adjustments to sales for restaurants that were not open for the
entire year presented (such as a restaurant closed for renovation) to annualize sales for such period of time. This measurement allows
management to assess changes in consumer spending patterns at our restaurants and the overall performance of our restaurant base. 

The
following table shows the AUVs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively:

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
primary uses of cash are for operational expenditures and capital investments, including new restaurants, costs incurred for restaurant
remodels and restaurant fixtures. Historically, our main sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations, borrowings from banks,
and sales of common shares. 

We
believe that the expected cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the sales of equity to Alumni pursuant to our equity line agreement
will be adequate to fund operating lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital obligations for at least the next 12 months
and thereafter.

Cash
Flows Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 

Net
cash provided by operating activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 1,164,719 which resulted from net loss
of 3,203,137, non-cash charges of 623,253 for depreciation and amortization and net cash inflows of 3,744,603 from changes in operating
assets and liabilities. The net loss was greater for the period relative to prior periods as a result of an increase in interest expenses
following the acquisition of Las Vegas entities despite of the management efforts to control general and administrative expenses. The
net cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities were the result of increases in due to related party by 1,746,620,
accounts payable and accrued expenses by 199,483, other payables by 1,012,591, and a decrease in other assets by 825,960 which was

cash outflows of 649,824 from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net loss was significantly higher for the period relative
to prior periods as a result of restaurant startup costs and increased general and administrative expenses. The net cash outflows from
changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily the result of an increase in other assets by 564,775, a decrease in due to
related party of 142,106 and a decrease in payables of 3,118, which was offset by decreases in inventory and other payables. The increase
in other assets of 564,775 primarily consists of a payment of 294,276 in escrow to purchase a restaurant in Southern California and
an investment of 300,000 in a financial company for a fixed interest income. 

Cash
Flows Used in Investing Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2,237,042 and 1,339,132, respectively.

Income
Taxes 

The
Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and California state jurisdictions. 

We
are considered a U.S. corporation and a regarded entity for U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. Accordingly, a provision will
be recorded for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations for U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes. 

JOBS
Act Accounting Election 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various public
company reporting requirements for up to five years or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. The JOBS
Act provides that an emerging growth company can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until those standards
apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. Accordingly, our financial statements
may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to utilize estimates and make judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates
are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis, and the results of these evaluations form a basis for making decisions
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of our
financial statements are reasonable. The critical accounting policies affecting our financial reporting are summarized in Note 2 to the
financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

We
have determined that all other issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements are inapplicable or insignificant to us and once
adopted are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position. 

31 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by 17 C.F.R. 229.10(f)(1) and are not required to provide information under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures
were ineffective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding any required disclosure. 

Management
has identified control deficiencies regarding inadequate accounting resources, the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger
internal control environment. Management of the Company believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of the Company s
accounting staff. The small size of the Company s accounting outsourced staff may prevent adequate controls in the future due to
the cost/benefit of such remediation. 

To
mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with
the use of external legal and accounting professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable
us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework. 

These
control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of account balances that would result in a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement to our financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In light of this material weakness, we performed
additional analyses and procedures in order to conclude that our financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 included
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were fairly stated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our material
weaknesses, our financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance
with GAAP. 

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

This
annual report does not include a report of management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation
report of the company s registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission for newly public companies. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
