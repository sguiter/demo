THERAPEUTICS CORPORATION 

 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

The
Company may further expand its pipeline with other internal or external compounds in the future, but all other internally discovered
compounds are pre-clinical and no commercial discussions about in-licensing have been initiated to date, other than as disclosed
in this quarterly report with respect to the licensing of the certain spray formulations from Benuvia Operations LLC Benuvia ),
entered into on December 23, 2023. 

The
Company has a limited operating history and has not generated revenue from its intended operations. The Company s business
and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide along with local, state, and
federal governmental policy decisions. A host of factors beyond the Company s control could cause fluctuations in these
conditions. Adverse conditions may include changes in the biotechnology regulatory environment, technological advances that render
the Company s technologies obsolete, availability of resources for clinical trials, acceptance of technologies into the
medical community, and competition from larger, more well-funded companies. 

On
February 21, 2024, the Company completed the initial public offering of its Common Stock (the IPO and issued shares
of its Common Stock at a price of per share. The aggregate net proceeds from the IPO were approximately million after
deducting million in underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. 

Risks
and Uncertainties 

In
February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this
action, various nations, including the United States, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus. 

The
escalation in October 2023 of the conflict between Israel and Hamas also could cause disruptions to global economic conditions
and effect the stability of the Middle East region. It is unknown how long any of these disruptions will continue and whether
such disruptions will become more severe. 

The
impact of these conflicts on the world economy is not determinable as of the date of these financial statements and the specific
impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date
of these financial statements. 

million and a working capital deficit of million. These factors indicate
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance
of these financial statements. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
as a going concern. 

The
financial statements included in this report do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the matters discussed herein.
While the Company believes in the viability of the Company s strategy to generate sufficient revenue, control costs, and
raise additional funds, when necessary, there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company s ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon the ability to implement the business plan, generate sufficient revenues, raise capital, and
to control operating expenses. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million in cash and a working capital deficit of approximately million,
compared to approximately million in cash and a working capital deficit of approximately million at December
31, 2023. 

Based
on the Company s current projections, management believes there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue to operate
as a going concern and fund its operations through at least the next twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements.
While the Company will continue to invest in its business and the development of CC8464, CT2000, and CT3000, and potentially other
molecules, it is unlikely that the Company will generate product or licensing revenue during the next twelve months. During the
period, the Company completed its initial public offering, raising million, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses , and the Company
may need to raise additional funds through either strategic partnerships or the capital markets. However, there is no assurance
that the Company will be able to raise such additional funds on acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company raises additional
funds by issuing securities, existing stockholders may be diluted. 

If
adequate funds are not available and expenditures exceed the Company s current expectations, the Company may be required
to curtail its operations or other business activities or obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others
that may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets. 

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial
accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared
effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised
financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and
comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The
Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and
it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the
new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s
financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which
has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting
standards used.

stock options, warrants, and 2 unvested restricted stock units RSUs were excluded from dilutive earnings per share as their effects were anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2023, stock
options were excluded from dilutive earnings per share as their effects were anti-dilutive. 

The
Company follows the provision of the ASC 740 related to Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Position. When tax returns are filed,
it is more likely than not that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others
are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the
period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is most likely that not that the position will be
sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset
or aggregated with other positions. 

Tax
positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more
than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated
with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain
tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing
authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions will more likely than not be upheld upon examination. As
such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits. 

The
federal and state income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing
authorities, generally for three years after they were filed. The Company has filed its tax returns for the year ended December
31, 2023 and after review of the prior year financial statements and the results of operations through December 31, 2023, the
Company has recorded a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset. 

. However, the Company believed the assertions
made by Mr. Kopfli were without merit and commenced a lawsuit against Mr. Kopfli and Chromocell Holdings in the Supreme Court
for the State of New York, County of New York on June 7, 2024 (Index No. 652917/2024, the New York Action ), asserting
causes of action against Mr. Kopfli for breach of the Employment Agreement entered into on January 10, 2023 between the Company
and Mr. Kopfli, breach of fiduciary duty by Mr. Kopfli, as well as breach of contract against Chromocell Holdings. The Company
also asserted a faithless servant claim against Mr. Kopfli, seeking a ruling that Mr. Kopfli was not entitled to
compensation from the Company. The Company sought monetary damages against Mr. Kopfli and Chromocell Holdings in the New York
Action, plus disgorgement of all compensation previously paid or accrued to Mr. Kopfli by the Company. 

By
Order dated October 3, 2024, the court in the New York Action awarded the Company a default judgment against Mr. Kopfli and Chromocell
Holdings on all claims, and ordered an assessment of damages against Mr. Kopfli and Chromocell Holdings (to be held at a date
to be determined). As of September 30, 2024, the Company has removed the accrual of 363,091 in compensation expenses and recorded
a gain on default judgement in the same amount. 

Camden
Consulting LLC 

The
Company entered into a Consultant Agreement with Camden Capital LLC Camden ), dated January 10, 2023 (the Consultant
Agreement ). This Consultant Agreement replaced an agreement with Mr. Francis Knuettel II dated June 2, 2022 and pursuant
to which, Camden agreed to provide the services of Mr. Knuettel, who was to serve as the Company s Chief Financial and Strategy
Officer, Treasurer and Secretary. 

Under
the Consultant Agreement, 

The
Consultant Agreement contemplates an additional consulting fee, as determined by the Board. The potential additional consulting
fee is 50 of the annualized consulting fee and will be based on achievement of performance goals and objectives established by
the Board in concert with Mr. Knuettel in January of each year. The Board may increase the potential additional consulting fee
in recognition of performance in excess of the performance objectives. Any amount shall only be paid if Camden continues to provide
consulting services to the Company as of the date of payment, which will be no later than March 15 of the year following the year
to which the additional consulting fee relates. Any additional consulting fee for 2022 is payable solely in the Board s
discretion. 

Pursuant
to the Consultant Agreement, in the event the relationship with Camden is involuntarily terminated by the Company other than for
 Cause or if Camden terminates the relationship for Good Reason, Camden is entitled to receive (i)
six months of consulting fees at the same rate existing immediately prior to termination, (ii) a potential additional consulting
fee, if performance goals and objectives have been established for the year and prorated for the period of service, and (iii)
six months of additional vesting credit with respect to any outstanding time-based equity awards. Cause and Good
Reason are each defined in the Consultant Agreement. 

Finally,
Camden and Mr. Knuettel agree to certain non-solicitation and non-competition provisions for a period of 12 months following termination
of the relationship and to certain confidentiality obligations. Additional terms and conditions are set forth in the Consultant
Agreement. 

On
June 23, 2023, shares of Common Stock was cancelled, and the Company agreed to grant Camden
an option to acquire shares of Common Stock within 30 days of the closing of the IPO. As of June 23, 2023, such
RSU for shares of the Company s Common Stock had not vested, and no expense was recorded on the Company s
financial statements. In addition, from and after June 1, 2023, the consulting fee will be paid in cash by the Company. No
other material changes were made to the Consultant Agreement. 

Effective
July 19, 2023, the Board appointed
Francis Knuettel II as Interim Chief Executive Officer and as of March 13, 2024, the Board appointed
Francis Knuettel II as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Knuettel will serve as the Company s Chief Executive
Officer until a successor is duly elected and qualified, unless sooner removed. In addition to his role as Chief Executive Officer
of the Company, Mr. Knuettel will continue to serve in his capacity as Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary of the
Company.

Company has never declared nor paid any cash dividends on its Common Stock, and the Company does not anticipate paying any cash
dividends in the foreseeable future. 

The

Overview 

We
are a clinical-stage biotech company focused on developing and commercializing new therapeutics to alleviate pain. Our clinical
focus is to selectively target the sodium ion-channel known as NaV1.7 , which has been genetically validated as a
pain receptor in human physiology. A NaV1.7 blocker is a chemical entity that modulates the structure of the sodium-channel in
a way to prevent the transmission of pain perception to the central nervous system CNS ). Our goal is to develop
a novel and proprietary class of NaV blockers that target the body s peripheral nervous system. 

We
have formally launched three programs developing pain treatment therapeutics, both based on the same proprietary molecule, as
follows: 

Neuropathic
Pain : CC8464 is being developed to address certain types of neuropathic pain. The chemical characteristics of CC8464 restrict
its entry into the CNS and limit its effect to the NaV1.7 channels in the peripheral nervous system, which consists of the nerves
outside the brain and spinal cord. Activation of other channels in the CNS can result in side effects, including addiction and
other centrally mediated adverse effects. Since CC8464 is designed to not penetrate the CNS it is highly unlikely to produce CNS
mediated side effects including euphoria or addiction. Based on its characteristics, preclinical studies (described below) and
the Phase 1 studies we have completed to date, we believe that CC8464, if approved, could become an attractive option for both
patients and physicians as a treatment for moderate-to-severe pain in Erythromelalgia EM and idiopathic small fiber neuropathy iSFN ). 

24 

We
conducted four Phase 1 trials with 207 patients. The results showed that CC8464 has a good overall tolerability and demonstrated
no liver or renal toxicity, no central nervous system changes and no cardiovascular findings but may cause rashes in certain patients.
The occurrence of rashes is not uncommon in the class of molecules to which CC8464 belongs and the rashes were resolved in all
cases with topical steroids and/or topical antihistamines (with the exception of one patient requiring systemic steroids). 

As
a result of the potential for rashes, following discussions with the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration FDA ), we decided to launch a slow dose escalation study to further evaluate the incidence
of rashes. By titrating the dose over nine weeks, we anticipate that we will reduce or eliminate this side effect. We expect that
the slow dose escalation study will also help determine the need for dose escalation in the final treatment regime. Even though
the FDA has in the past approved drugs that listed rashes as a potential side effect, we do not know if CC8464 will be approved
by the FDA (or any foreign authority). 

We
anticipate that the dose escalation will enroll the first patient dosing in the third quarter of 2024. The dose escalation trial
will enroll approximately 20 healthy volunteers who will receive CC8464 over a period of approximately nine weeks, with the dose
escalation study expected to take approximately nine months in total. We anticipate that the slower dose escalation will decrease
the likelihood of drug-related skin reactions. The primary endpoint of the dose escalation trail will be safety and tolerability
of the slower dose titration; however, we will also be measuring blood concentrations of CC8464, which will allow us to better
understand the pharmacokinetics of CC8464. Even if it is ultimately determined that we will need an escalation period for chronic
pain treatment therapy, which patients could well take for the remainder of their lives, we do not believe the dose escalation
approach is consequential. 

We
plan to conduct the escalation trial in Australia to avail ourselves of a 43.5 tax credit for clinical expenses incurred in Australia
and, on January 9, 2023, established an Australian subsidiary through which the work will be conducted. The location of the proof-of-concept POC has not been determined at this time, with availability of facilities and patient population, costs,
tax credits, centers of excellence in the respective fields (EM or iSFN) are all factors in the ultimate determination of the
location. 

We
are currently working on the development of the Phase 2a POC plan and expect to launch the Phase 2a POC study in 2025 to assess
the potential efficacy of CC8464 in EM and iSFN patients. Both are orphan indications for which we plan to apply for orphan drug
designations. The orphan indication may decrease the scope of the ultimate development program that is necessary for approval
and is associated with a marketing exclusivity period from the FDA along with some tax advantages. 

Though
the Phase 2a POC study design has not yet been completed, the study will take approximately twelve months after it is initiated.
The primary endpoint will be the amount of pain experienced from EM or iSFN with secondary endpoints including other measurements
like pain relief and neuropathy scores. The final design may change based on feedback from regulatory authorities or information
learned during the dose escalation trial. 

The
potential population for EM in the United States is estimated to be between 5,000 and 50,000 patients and the potential population
for ISFN in the United States is estimated to be between 20,000 and 80,000 patients. In both instances, we expect patients would
potentially take our drug for the remainder of their lives, and given the lack of good therapeutic alternatives, we expect to
have a robust, ongoing, and durable market. 

The
Phase 2a results will have significance beyond EM and iSFN and provide important insights about NaV1.7 as a potential target to
find novel pain medications as an alternative to opioids, the continuing primary standard of care in analgesics. We believe that
positive results from the Phase 2a study could not only act as support for CC8464 s potential in EM and iSFN but may also
provide guidance of its potential for other indications of peripheral neuropathic pain.

Eye
Pain : Based on the same proprietary molecule as CC8464, our Eye Pain program, titled CT2000, is for the potential treatment
of both acute and chronic eye pain. NaV1.7 channels are present on the cornea, making it a viable biological target for treating
eye pain. Eye pain may occur with various conditions, including severe dry eye disease, trauma and surgery. Existing therapies
for eye pain (such as steroids, topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, lubricants, local anesthetics) are limited in
their effectiveness and/or limited in the duration that they may be prescribed because of safety issues. We intend to explore
the viability of developing CT2000 as a topical agent for the relief of eye pain. A potential advantage of this approach is that
topical administration of CT2000 is unlikely to lead to any hypersensitivity or skin reactions, like what was noted with systemic
administration of CC8464, because the systemic absorption from a topical administration would be extremely limited. We have commenced
development of a topical ophthalmic formulation of CT2000 that would initially be evaluated for ophthalmic toxicology and then
followed by a POC trial in patients. We expect the trials for this ophthalmic formulation of CT2000 to start in 2025. 

Current
options for the treatment of ocular pain center on the use of corticosteroids and non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug NSAID based therapeutics. These options suffer from sight-threatening complications
such as Glaucoma and corneal melting, thus there is a large unmet need for other approaches. As an example of the potential patient
population, we estimate that there are approximately 5 million cases of corneal abrasions per year in the United States. In addition,
other potential indications associated with eye pain include: 

severe
 dry eye, 

side effects from
 photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and pterygium surgery, 

second eye cataract
 surgery, 

neuropathic corneal
 pain, and 

severe uveitis and
 severe iritis/scleritis. 

As
NaV1.7 channels are present on the cornea and is a viable biological target for treating eye pain, we believe that we have a sound
scientific basis for our ability to treat a multitude of eye pain indications. We are in the process of formulating CT2000 eye
drops and expect to move into animal toxicity studies in the second half of 2024. From there, we intend to move into proof-of-concept
studies in humans. 

Depot
Program : Based on several novel formulations of CC8464, the Company s newly launched program, titled CT3000, is for
the potential treatment of post operative pain with the use of nerve blocks. Examples would include knee surgery or shoulder
surgery. Existing therapies for nerve blocks lead to neuromuscular blockade which prevents movement following surgery. Doctors
often want patients to move soon after surgery to avoid complications such as blood clots. A NaV1.7 inhibitor used for nerve
blocks may provide good analgesia but will not lead to neuromuscular blockade that prevents movement like other local anesthetics.
 The Company intends to explore the viability of developing CT3000 as an injectable depot for nerve blocks and pain following
surgery. The Company has commenced development of an injectable depot for nerve blocks that would initially be studied in
animal models of postoperative pain followed by toxicology and then by a POC trial in patients. The Company is currently
conducting pharmacokinetic and efficacy trials in animals and expects human trials for the depot injection formulation of CT3000
to start in early 2026. 

We
may further expand our pipeline with other internal or external compounds in the future, but all other internally discovered compounds
are pre-clinical and no commercial discussions about in-licensing have been initiated to date, other than as disclosed in this
Report with respect to the licensing of the Spray Formulations (as defined below). 

Background 

We
were incorporated in Delaware on March 19, 2021. On August 10, 2022, we entered into the Contribution Agreement with Chromocell
Corporation, a Delaware corporation Chromocell Holdings ). Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, as of
the Contribution Date, we acquired from Chromocell Holdings all assets, liabilities and results of operations related to Chromocell
Holdings therapeutic business, including all patents, pre-clinical and Phase I study results and data, and trade secrets
related to the CC8464 compound, in exchange for the issuance by us of 1,111,112 shares of our c ommon
stock, par value 0.0001 per share Common Stock and (ii) 600,000 shares of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock Series A Preferred Stock ). 

26 

On
August 2, 2023, we entered into a Side Letter to the Contribution Agreement with Chromocell Holdings (the Holdings Side
Letter ). Pursuant to the Holdings Side Letter, upon closing of our initial public offering IPO ): (a) Chromocell
Holdings re-assumed all 1.6 million in direct liabilities previously assumed by the Company in accordance with the Contribution
Agreement, (b) Chromocell Holdings waived the Company s obligations to make a cash payment in the amount of 0.6 million
to Chromocell Holdings, and (c) in consideration thereof, we issued to Chromocell Holdings 2,600 shares of Series
C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock of the Company, par value of 0.0001 per share Series C Preferred Stock ). 

On
February 21, 2024, we completed the IPO and issued and sold 1,100,000 shares of Common Stock at a price to the public of 6.00
per share. The aggregate net proceeds from the IPO were approximately 5.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions of approximately 0.5 million and offering expenses of approximately 0.4 million. 

In
connection with the completion of the IPO: (A) we effected the 9-for-1 reverse stock split effective February 15, 2024 (the Reverse
Stock Split of our shares of Common Stock, (B) all 600,000 issued and outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock
automatically converted into 499,429 shares of Common Stock, (C) 389,757 and accrued interest of approximately 28,336 as of
February 21, 2024 outstanding under our senior secured convertible notes issued in a
bridge financing in April 2023 for an aggregate principal amount of 393,808 the April Bridge Financing after giving effect to the Representative Affiliate Transactions (as defined below), automatically converted into approximately
87,109 shares of Common Stock, (D) 197,421 and accrued interest of 8,169 as of February 21, 2024 outstanding under our senior
secured convertible notes issued in a bridge financing in September 2023 for an aggregate
principal amount of 198,128 (the September Bridge Financing after giving effect to the Representative
Affiliate Transactions, automatically converted into approximately 43,385 shares of Common Stock, which includes an additional
549 shares of Common Stock issuable as consideration for the September Bridge Financing (the Bonus Shares ), (E)
we issued 37,500 shares of Common Stock to an investor as consideration for its previous agreement to provide funding that is
no longer necessary in connection with the IPO, (F) we effected the Representative Affiliate Transactions, (G) we effected the
transactions contemplated by the Holdings Side Letter, and issued an aggregate of 2,600 shares of Series C Preferred Stock to
Chromocell Holdings pursuant thereto, and (H) we issued (i) 93,823 shares to a lender holding a note payable for 450,000 (the
 Investor Note and (ii) 29,167 shares to one of our directors holding the promissory note in the aggregate principal
amount of 175,000 (the Director Note in full satisfaction of our obligations thereunder (in the case of (A) through
(D) and (H) above, based on the IPO price of 6.00 per share of Common Stock). We refer to these actions as the IPO Transactions. 

In
addition, certain stockholders of the Company Selling Stockholders ), as identified in the Registration Statement,
have agreed to offer for resale of up to an aggregate of 2,969,823 shares of Common Stock (the Selling Stockholder Shares to the public. After conversion of the convertible notes or shares of preferred stock, as applicable, the Selling Stockholders,
or their respective transferees, pledgees, donees or other successors-in-interest, may sell the Selling Stockholders Shares through
public or private transactions at prevailing market prices, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at privately negotiated
prices. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling Stockholder Shares by the Selling Stockholders. 

The
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock present in person, by remote communication, if applicable,
or represented by proxy at the annual meeting of stockholders held on October 22, 2024 approved a reincorporation merger of the
Company in the State of Nevada with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with a simultaneous name change to Channel
Therapeutics Corporation (the Reincorporation Merger ). The Reincorporation Merger is expected to occur in
the fourth quarter of 2024. 

Trends
and Other Factors Affecting Our Business 

On
December 23, 2023, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement (the Benuvia License Agreement with Benuvia
Operations LLC Benuvia for the Diclofenac Spray Formulation (as defined below), an intranasal spray formulation
of Rizatriptan and an Ondansetron sublingual spray formulation (collectively, the Spray Formulations ), diversifying
our pipeline of non-opioid pain treatment therapies, while adding therapeutic options for related conditions. The sublingual formulation
of a Diclofenac spray for the treatment of acute pain (the Diclofenac Spray Formulation is patented and has started
clinical development in human volunteers. Preliminary pharmacokinetics suggest that this formulation may have a faster onset of
action than oral Diclofenac tablets. Diclofenac is an NSAID that is also marketed under additional brand names including Voltaren
and Cataflam in its pill form. Rizatriptan, whose brand name is Maxalt, is used for the acute treatment of Migraines as a pill.
By a number of clinical measures it is thought to be superior to Sumatriptan. A sublingual formulation of Rizatriptan may potentially
have a faster onset of action than an oral form and may be easier to tolerate than swallowing a pill when patients are experiencing
nausea as a result of the migraine headache. Ondansetron is an anti-emetic that is available in oral and intravenous form. An
Ondansetron sublingual spray formulation may potentially have a faster onset of action than an oral form and may be easier to
tolerate than swallowing a pill when patients are experiencing nausea. Under the terms of the Benuvia License Agreement, Benuvia
will be responsible for the manufacturing and supply of the Spray Formulations, but we will have exclusive, worldwide rights to
develop, commercialize and distribute the Spray Formulations. 

27 

In
connection with the Benuvia License Agreement, we agreed to pay Benuvia a six and one-half percent (6.5 royalty on net sales
of the Spray Formulations for a period of up to 15 years from the date of the first commercial sale of any of the Spray Formulations.
In addition, on December 23, 2023, we entered into a stock issuance agreement with Benuvia pursuant to which we issued to Benuvia
384,226 shares of our Common Stock, which may be offered and sold pursuant to the resale prospectus which forms a part of the
Registration Statement. 

While
we currently do not have strategy and development plans for the Spray Formulations licensed from Benuvia, beginning in the third
quarter of 2024, we plan to develop clinical programs for each of the Spray Formulations, determine the labelling strategy that
would be obtained from completion of these programs and discuss with the FDA the requirements for bringing each of the Spray Formulations
to market. We anticipate bringing the Spray Formulations to market through the FDA 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for new drug applications;
however, the exact details will require further consultation with the FDA. 

As
a result, our results of operations and balance sheets may not be indicative of future operating results or of our future financial
condition. 

Going
Concern 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had a net loss of approximately 6.0 million and approximately 3.3 million,
respectively, and will require additional capital in order to operate in the normal course of business and fund clinical studies.
The IPO closed on February 21, 2024, from which, the Company received net proceeds from the IPO of approximately 5.7 million
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company (excluding any exercise
of the warrants issued to A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (the Representative or its designees, in connection with the IPO). 

Based
on the Company s current projections, management believes there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue to operate
as a going concern and fund its operations through at least the next twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements.
While the Company will continue to invest in its business and the development of CC8464, CT2000 and CT 3000, and potentially other
molecules, it is unlikely that the Company will generate product or licensing revenue during the next twelve months. During the
period, the Company completed its initial public offering, raising 5.7 million, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses , and the Company
may need to raise additional funds through either strategic partnerships or the capital markets. However, there is no assurance
that the Company will be able to raise such additional funds on acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company raises additional
funds by issuing securities, existing stockholders may be diluted.

Professional
Fees 

We
incurred professional expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 1,693,676 and 1,021,187, respectively.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, this represented an increase of 672,489, or

Other
(Expense) Income 

We
incurred other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 282,203 as compared to other expense for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 of 358,171. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to the same period in 2023, this represented a decrease of 75,968 or 21 . The other expense for the nine months ended
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily the result of interest expense and gain
on default judgement. The increase in the interest expense was due to the remaining amortization of the debt discount on the Company s
notes being accelerated upon the conversion of the notes to equity upon consummation of the IPO. 

Liquidity 

Sources
of Liquidity and Capital 

We
are in our early stages of development and growth, without established records of sales or earnings. We will be subject to numerous
risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or emerging growth companies. We have not
yet commercialized any products, and we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales of any of our compounds for several
years. 

Cash
totaled 1.3 million and 0.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 19.5 million and 13.5 million, respectively, and had a working
capital deficit of 1.4 million and a working capital deficit 6.4 million, respectively. 

Historically,
we have funded our operations from a series of cash advances from Chromocell Holdings, licensing arrangements, bridge and note
issuances and grants from the National Institutes of Health. 

On
February 8, 2024, we and certain affiliates of the Representative entered into amendments to the senior secured convertible notes
issued to such affiliates of the Representative in the April Bridge Financing and September Bridge Financing to remove the automatic
conversion features from such notes (the Bridge Financing Note Amendments ). Under the Bridge Financing Note Amendments,
both notes issued in the April Bridge Financing and the September Bridge Financing had a maturity date of March 1, 2024, and the
full principal amount of both notes and any accrued interest thereon was payable solely in cash upon the consummation of the IPO.
Both notes had an annual interest rate of eight percent (8 ), which accrued daily, and was calculated on the basis of a 360-day
year (consisting of twelve 30 calendar day periods). 

On
February 10, 2024, we entered into a Stock Rescission Agreement with certain affiliates of the Representative (the Stock
Rescission Agreement and, together with the Bridge Financing Note Amendments, the Representative Affiliate Transactions ),
pursuant to which we rescinded 111,129 shares of our Common Stock held by such affiliates of the Representative and agreed to
refund an aggregate of 91,513 paid by such affiliates of the Representative in consideration therefor within 30 days of the effective
date of the Stock Rescission Agreement. At September 30, 2024, all such amounts have
been paid pursuant to the Representative Affiliate Transactions and there are no remaining obligations thereto. 

On
February 21, 2024, we completed the IPO and issued 1,100,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of 6.00 per share. The aggregate
net proceeds from the IPO were approximately 5.7 million after deducting approximately 0.9 million in underwriting discounts
and commissions and offering expenses. 

31 

In
connection with the completion of the IPO: (A) we effected the Reverse Stock Split, effective as of February 15, 2024 (B) all
600,000 issued and outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock automatically converted into 499,429 shares of Common Stock,
(C) principal in the amount of 389,757, along with accrued interest of approximately 28,336 as of February 21, 2024, outstanding

On
July 26, 2024, the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 26, 2024 (the CEF Purchase
Agreement ), with Tikkun Capital LLC Tikkun ), providing for a committed equity financing facility, pursuant
to which, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in the CEF Purchase Agreement, Tikkun has
committed to purchase, at the Company s direction in its sole discretion, up to an aggregate of 30,000,000 (the Total
Commitment of the shares of Common Stock (the Purchase Shares ), subject to certain limitations set forth
in the CEF Purchase Agreement, from time to time during the term of the CEF Purchase Agreement. Concurrently with the execution
of the CEF Purchase Agreement, the Company and Tikkun also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of July 26,
2024, pursuant to which the Company agreed to file with the SEC one or more registration statements, to register under the Securities
Act, the offer and resale by Tikkun of all of the Purchase Shares that may be issued and sold by the Company to Tikkun from time
to time under the CEF Purchase Agreement. 

On
August 5, 2024, our Board authorized the Repurchase Plan, pursuant to which up to 250,000 of our Common Stock may be repurchased
prior to December 31, 2024, unless completed sooner or otherwise extended. Open market purchases are intended to be conducted
in accordance with applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, including the guidelines and conditions of Rule
10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased
will depend on a variety of factors including trading price, the Company s financial performance, corporate and regulatory
requirements and other market conditions. On
October 22, 2024, the Board authorized an amendment (the Amendment to the Repurchase Plan to increase the total
value of shares of Common Stock available for repurchase by the Company under the Repurchase Plan by an additional 500,000, to
 750,000. 

Future
Funding Requirements 

Our
primary use of cash is to fund clinical development, operating expenses and repay accrued liabilities associated with our IPO. 

With
respect to the Company s future expected operations expenses, the primary expense drivers will be research and development
and management overhead, including costs of being a public company. Of these, it is expected that research and development will
be the largest expense and comprise approximately 3.0 million in the twelve months following the IPO, which will be utilized
for the furtherance of the Company s CC8464, CT2000 and CT3000 programs. We have based the research and development costs
on current clinical and pre-clinical trial parameters and expectations on certain existing tax credits, and there is no certainty
that the clinical and pre-clinical trial parameters or tax credits available to the Company will remain as they are, which could
lead to changes in our research and development expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of
when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses. 

32 

We
expect to continue to incur significant and increasing expenses and operating losses in connection with our ongoing research and
development activities. In addition, with the closing of the IPO, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating
as a public company. As a result, we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable
future. 

Based
on our current operating plan, we believe that the net proceeds from the IPO, together with our existing cash, will be sufficient
to fund our operations and capital expenses through the end of 2024. However, we have based this estimate on assumptions that
may prove to be incorrect, and we could exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect. 

We
may also raise additional funding through strategic relationships, public or private equity or debt financings, credit facilities,
grants or other arrangements. If such funding is not available or not available on terms acceptable to us, our current development
plan and plans for expansion of our general and administrative infrastructure may be curtailed. If we raise additional funds through
the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain
covenants that restrict our operations. Any other third-party funding arrangement could require us to relinquish valuable rights. 

The
source, timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions. Funding may not be available
when needed, at all, or on terms acceptable to us. Lack of necessary funds may require us to, among other things, delay, scale
back or eliminate expenses including some or all of our planned development. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. 

Cash
Flows

following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

For

were 591,936, consisting of cash received from net proceeds from the issuance of notes in the amount of 591,936. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not have, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet
arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
following discussions are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. 

The
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingencies. We continually evaluate the accounting
policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experiences and assumptions
believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates
made by management. 

See
Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying financial statements for a detailed description
of our significant accounting policies. 

Income
Taxes 

We
are subject to income taxes in the U.S. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax expense, deferred taxes and
uncertain tax positions. The underlying assumptions are also highly susceptible to change from period to period. In assessing
the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all the deferred
tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred taxes assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable
income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of
deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and taxable income in carryback years and tax-planning strategies when
making this assessment. There is currently significant negative evidence which contributes to our recording a valuation allowance
against our deferred tax assets due to cumulative losses since inception. 

Although
we believe our assumptions, judgments, and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and
the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial
statements. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date. Adjustments to income tax expense, to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or adjust
the allowance in a future period, could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Recently
Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

The
FASB issues ASUs to amend the authoritative literature in the Accounting Standards Codification ASC ). There have
been several ASUs to date, including those above, that amend the original text of ASC. Management believes that those issued to
date either (i) provide supplemental guidance, (ii) are technical corrections, (iii) are not applicable to us or (iv) are not
expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

34 

Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB and do not require adoption until a future date are not expected
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Other than below, management does not believe
that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standard if currently adopted would have a material effect on
the accompanying financial statements. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disaggregated
information about a reporting entity s effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as information related to income taxes
paid to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This ASU will be effective for the annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and impacts of adoption of this ASU. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

As
a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required
by this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in our company s reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met,
and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a
company have been detected. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective. 

Management
identified the following material weaknesses: 

1. 
 We lack
 the necessary corporate accounting resources to maintain adequate segregation of duties. Such a lack of segregation of duties
 is typical in a company with limited resources. 

2. 
 We lack the ability
 to provide multiple levels of review in connection with the financial reporting process, which means that we cannot ensure
 that we are meeting certain financial reporting and transaction processing controls standards. 

3. 
 We lack the necessary
 internal IT infrastructure to ensure proper IT general controls. Additionally, we are reliant on third-party software for
 our financial systems and cannot ensure there are no vulnerabilities in these systems. 

35 

Changes
in Internal Controls 

With
the completion of the IPO, the Company has begun instituting controls and procedures that we expect will demonstrably improve
the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures in upcoming reporting periods. 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party
to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, would have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless
of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources,
negative publicity and reputation harm, and other factors. 

On
February 14, 2024, our Board received a demand letter from an attorney representing Chromocell Holdings and our former Chief Executive
Officer and former Chief Strategy Officer, Mr. Christian Kopfli, who was released for cause as disclosed elsewhere
in this Report. Mr. Kopfli alleged an improper termination for cause and claimed to seek monetary damages in the
amount of 479,169. Of the 479,169 asserted by Mr. Kopfli, as of September 30, 2024,
the Company had accrued 363,091 in compensation expenses associated with Mr. Kopfli s prior employment with the Company.
However, the Company believes the assertions made by Mr. Kopfli are without merit and commenced the New York Action against Mr.
Kopfli and Chromocell Holdings , asserting causes of action against Mr. Kopfli
for breach of the Employment Agreement entered into on January 10, 2023 between the Company and Mr. Kopfli, breach of fiduciary
duty by Mr. Kopfli, as well as breach of contract against Chromocell Holdings. The Company also asserted a faithless servant 
claim against Mr. Kopfli, seeking a ruling that Mr. Kopfli is not entitled to compensation from the Company. The Company seeks
monetary damages against Mr. Kopfli and Chromocell Holdings in the New York Action, plus disgorgement of all compensation previously
paid or accrued to Mr. Kopfli by the Company. 

By
Order dated October 3, 2024, the court in the New York Action awarded the Company a default judgment against Mr. Kopfli and Chromocell
Holdings on all claims, and ordered an assessment of damages against Mr. Kopfli and Chromocell Holdings (to be held at a date
to be determined). As of September 30, 2024, the Company has removed the accrual of 363,091 in compensation expenses and recorded
a gain on default judgement in the same amount. 

On
July 31, 2024, the Company received a demand letter from an attorney representing Parexel International (IRL) Limited Parexel ).
 The letter, which was addressed to both the Company and Chromocell Holdings, purports to be a notice of default of
the Promissory Note between Chromocell Holdings and Parexel and seeks the payment of allegedly unpaid principal
in the amount of 682,551.49 plus interest exceeding 177,000. The Company denies that it is liable for any of the amounts
sought by Parexel; the Company is not a party to the Promissory Note and does not believe it is liable for any
amounts allegedly due thereunder. 

Item

As
a smaller reporting company, the Company is not required to include the disclosure required under this Item 1A. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities 

On
August 12, 2024, the Company agreed to issue 10,000 shares of Common Stock to a vendor in exchange for outstanding invoices
related to services provided by the vendor to the Company. 

On
October 22, 2024, the Company agreed to issue up to an aggregate of 76,667 shares of Common Stock to three vendors in considerations
for the services provided by the vendor to the Company. 

Also
on October 22, 2024, the Company granted another vendor options to purchase up to an aggregate of 50,000 shares of Common Stock
at a grant price of 0.73 per share. 

36 

The
offers and sales of the above securities were deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance upon
Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D promulgated thereunder, or Rule 701 promulgated under Section 3(b) of the
Securities Act, as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering or pursuant to benefit plans and contracts relating
to compensation as provided under Rule 701. The recipients of the above securities represented their intentions to acquire the
securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof.

30, 2024, remaining availability under the Repurchase Plan was 175,821. Open market purchases are intended to be conducted in
accordance with applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, including the guidelines and conditions of Rule 10b-18
