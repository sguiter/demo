met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have
been received instead of stock.

For
loans and debt securities for which market quotations are not readily available, the Company determines their fair value based on third
party indicative broker quotes, where available, or the inputs that a hypothetical market participant would use to value the security
in a current hypothetical sale using a market comparables valuation technique. In applying the market comparables valuation technique,
the Company determines the fair value based on such factors as market participant inputs including synthetic credit ratings, estimated
remaining life, current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date. If, in the Company s
judgment, the market comparables technique is not sufficient or appropriate, the Company may use additional techniques such as an asset
liquidation or expected recovery model. 

For
equity securities of portfolio companies and partnership interests, the Company determines the fair value using an enterprise value waterfall
valuation technique. Under the enterprise value waterfall valuation technique, the Company determines the enterprise fair value of the
portfolio company and then waterfalls the enterprise value over the portfolio company s securities in order of their preference
relative to one another. To estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company, the Company weighs some or all of the traditional
market valuation techniques and factors based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company in order to estimate the enterprise
value. The techniques for performing investments may be based on, among other things: valuations of comparable public companies, recent
sales of private and public comparable companies, discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company, third party valuations
of the portfolio company, considering offers from third parties to buy the company, estimating the value to potential strategic buyers
and considering the value of recent investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company. For non-performing investments, the
Company may estimate the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company s assets and liabilities. The Company also takes
into account historical and anticipated financial results.

million of financing to SLF JV through cash contributions, with the Company providing million and TJHA
providing million, resulting in an and ownership between the two parties. The financing is issued in the form of an
unsecured note and equity. The unsecured note pays a fixed rate of per annum and is due and payable in full on October 20, 2033.
As of August 31, 2024, the Company and TJHA s investment in SLF JV consisted of an unsecured note of million and million,
respectively; and membership interest of million and million, respectively. As of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, the
Company s investment in the unsecured note of SLF JV had a fair value of million and million, respectively, and the
Company s investment in the membership interests of SLF JV had a fair value of million and million, respectively. 

The Company has determined that SLF JV is an
investment company under ASC 946; however, in accordance with such guidance the Company will generally not consolidate its investment
in a company other than a wholly owned investment company subsidiary. SLF JV is not a wholly owned investment company subsidiary as the
Company and TJHA each have an equal voting interest in SLF JV and thus neither party has a controlling financial interest. Furthermore,
ASC 810 concludes that in a joint venture where both members have equal decision making authority, it is not appropriate for one member
to consolidate the joint venture since neither has control. Accordingly, the Company does not consolidate SLF JV. 

For the three months ended August 31, 2024 and
August 31, 2023, the Company earned million and million, respectively, of interest income related to SLF JV, which is included
in interest income on control investments. For the six months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the Company earned million
and million, respectively, of interest income related to SLF JV, which is included in interest income on control investments. As

in interest receivable on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. 

For the three months ended August 31, 2024 and
August 31, 2023, the Company earned million and million, respectively, of dividend income related to SLF JV, which is included

in dividend receivable on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.. 

SLF JV s initial investment in SLF 2022
was in the form of an unsecured loan. The unsecured loan paid a floating rate of LIBOR plus per annum and was paid in full on June
9, 2023. The unsecured loan was repaid in full on October 28, 2022, as part of the CLO closing. 

On October 28, 2022, SLF 2022 issued million
of the 2022 JV CLO Notes through the JV CLO trust. The 2022 JV CLO Notes were issued pursuant to the JV Indenture, with the Trustee.
As part of the transaction, the Company purchased of the Class E Notes from SLF 2022 with a par value of million.

owned by the Company, are each filing standalone C Corporation tax returns for U.S. federal and state tax purposes. As separately
regarded entities for tax purposes, these entities are subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates. For tax purposes, any distributions
by the entities to the parent company would generally need to be distributed to the Company s shareholders. Generally, such distributions
of the entities income to the Company s shareholders will be considered as qualified dividends for tax purposes. The entities 
taxable net income will differ from U.S. GAAP net income because of deferred tax temporary differences arising from net operating losses
and unrealized appreciation and deprecation of securities held. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted corporate
federal and state tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those net operating losses are utilized and the
unrealized gains and losses are realized. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted off by entity, as allowed. The
recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded to the extent that it is more likely than not
that any portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized on the basis of a history of operating losses combined with insufficient
projected taxable income or other taxable events in the Corporate Blockers. In February 2022, SIA-GH, Inc., SIA-TT Inc. and SIA-VR, Inc.
received an approved plan of liquidation following the sale of equity held by each of the portfolio companies. In June 2024, SIA-MAC,
Inc. and SIA-VR, Inc. were dissolved. 

The Company may distribute a portion of its realized
net long term capital gains in excess of realized net short term capital losses to its stockholders, but may also decide to retain a
portion, or all, of its net capital gains and elect to pay the U.S. federal tax on the net capital gain, potentially in the form
of a deemed distribution to its stockholders. Income tax (provision) relating to an election to retain its net capital
gains, including in the form of a deemed distribution, is included as a component of income tax (provision) benefit from realized gains
on investments, depending on the character of the underlying taxable income (ordinary or capital gains), on the consolidated statements
of operations.

Net deferred tax liability 

As of August 31, 2024, the valuation allowance
on deferred tax assets was million, which represents the federal and state tax effect of net operating losses and unrealized losses
that the Company does not believe will be realized through future taxable income. Any adjustments to the Company s valuation allowance
will depend on estimates of future taxable income and will be made in the period such determination is made.

from its effective date, with one-year
renewals thereafter subject to certain approvals by the Company s board of directors and/or the Company s stockholders. Most
recently, on July 8, 2024, the Company s board of directors approved the renewal of the Management Agreement for an additional
one-year term. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Manager implements the Company s business strategy on a day-to-day basis
and performs certain services for the Company, subject to oversight by the board of directors. The Manager is responsible for, among
other duties, determining investment criteria, sourcing, analyzing and executing investments transactions, asset sales, financings and
performing asset management duties. Under the Management Agreement, the Company pays the Manager a management fee for investment advisory
and management services consisting of a base management fee and an incentive management fee. 

Base Management Fee and Incentive Management Fee 

The base management fee is paid quarterly following the filing
of the most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

The incentive management fee consists of the
following two parts: 

The first, payable quarterly in arrears, equals
 of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the
end of the immediately preceding quarter, that exceeds a quarterly hurdle rate measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter,
subject to a catch-up provision. There is no accumulation of amounts
on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter, and accordingly there is no claw back of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are
below the quarterly hurdle rate, and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate. 

The second part of the incentive fee is determined
and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Management Agreement) and equals of the Company s
 incentive fee capital gains, which equals the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from May 31,
2010 through the end of the fiscal year, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a
cumulative basis on each investment in the Company s portfolio, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive
fee. Importantly, the capital gains portion of the incentive fee is based on realized gains and realized and unrealized losses from May
31, 2010. Therefore, realized and unrealized losses incurred prior to such time will not be taken into account when calculating the capital
gains portion of the incentive fee, and the Manager will be entitled to of incentive fee capital gains that arise after May 31,
2010. In addition, for the purpose of the incentive fee capital gains calculations, the cost basis for computing realized
gains and losses on investments held by us as of May 31, 2010 will equal the fair value of such investments as of such date. 

For the three months ended August 31, 2024 and
August 31, 2023, the Company incurred million and million in base management fees, respectively. For the three months ended
August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the Company incurred million and million in incentive fees related to pre-incentive fee
net investment income, respectively. For the three months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the Company accrued an expense (benefit)
of million and million in incentive fees related to capital gains. 

74 

million and million in base management fees, respectively. For the six months ended August
31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the Company incurred million and million in incentive fees related to pre-incentive fee net investment
income, respectively. For the six months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the Company accrued an expense (benefit) of million and million in incentive fees related to capital gains. 

The accrual is calculated using both realized
and unrealized capital gains for the period. The actual incentive fee related to capital gains will be determined and payable in arrears
at the end of the fiscal year and will include only realized capital gains for the period. As of August 31, 2024, the base management
fees accrual was million and the incentive fees accrual was million and is included in base management and incentive fees payable
in the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. As of February 29, 2024, the base management fees accrual was
 million and the incentive fees accrual was million and is included in base management and incentive fees payable in the accompanying
consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. 

Administration Agreement 

On July 30, 2010, the Company entered into a
separate administration agreement (the Administration Agreement with the Manager, pursuant to which the Manager, as the
Company s administrator, has agreed to furnish the Company with the facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct
day-to-day operations and provide managerial assistance on the Company s behalf to those portfolio companies to which the Company
is required to provide such assistance. The initial term of the Administration Agreement was two years from its effective date, with
one-year renewals thereafter subject to certain approvals by the Company s board of directors and/or the Company s stockholders,
with the most renewal occurring on July 8, 2024. Since its inception the amount of expenses payable or reimbursable by the Company under
the Administration Agreement has been subject to a cap that is reviewed annually in connection with the renewal of the Administration
Agreement. Most recently, on August 1, 2024, the Company s board of directors approved the renewal of the Administration Agreement
for an additional one-year term and determined to increase the cap on the payment or reimbursement of expenses by the Company from 
million to million, effective August 1, 2024. The Company s board of directors will continue to assess the cap on payment

revolving securitized credit facility (the Revolving Facility ). On May 1, 2007, we entered into a million term securitized
credit facility (the Term Facility and, together with the Revolving Facility, the Facilities ), which was
fully drawn at closing. In December 2007, we consolidated the Facilities by using a draw under the Revolving Facility to repay the Term
Facility. In response to the market wide decline in financial asset prices, which negatively affected the value of our portfolio, we
terminated the revolving period of the Revolving Facility effective January 14, 2009 and commenced a two-year amortization period during
which all principal proceeds from the collateral were used to repay outstanding borrowings. A significant percentage of our total assets
had been pledged under the Revolving Facility to secure our obligations thereunder. 

Madison Credit Facility 

On July 30, 2010, we used the net proceeds from

facility with Madison Capital Funding LLC (the Madison Credit Facility ), in each case, to pay the full amount of principal
and accrued interest, including default interest, outstanding under the Revolving Facility. As a result, the Revolving Facility was terminated
in connection therewith. Substantially all of our total assets, other than those held by SBIC LP, SBIC II LP and SBIC III LP, were pledged

The repayment and termination of the Madison
Credit Facility resulted in a realized loss on the extinguishment of debt of million.

SBA Debentures 

The Company s wholly owned subsidiaries,

SBIC Subsidiaries provide up to million in long-term capital in the form of debentures guaranteed by the SBA. The Company s
wholly owned subsidiary, SBIC LP, repaid its outstanding debentures and subsequently surrendered its license to the SBA on January 3,
2024, providing the Company access to all undistributed capital of SBIC LP, and SBIC LP subsequently merged with and into the Company.
Under current SBIC regulations, for two or more SBICs under common control, the maximum amount of outstanding SBA debentures cannot exceed

SBA. A smaller enterprise is one that has a net worth not exceeding million and has average annual fully taxed net income not exceeding
 million for the two most recent fiscal years. SBA regulations also provide alternative size standard criteria to determine eligibility,
which depend on the industry in which the business is engaged and are based on such factors as the number of employees and gross sales.
According to SBA regulations, SBICs may make long-term loans to small businesses, invest in the equity securities of such businesses
and provide them with consulting and advisory services. 

The SBIC
Subsidiaries are subject to customary regulatory requirements including but not limited to, a periodic examination by the SBA and requirements
to maintain certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants. Receipt of an SBIC license does not assure that the SBIC Subsidiaries
will receive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding, which is dependent upon the SBIC Subsidiaries complying with SBA regulations and policies.
The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to each SBIC Subsidiary s assets over the Company s stockholders and debtholders
in the event that the Company liquidates such SBIC Subsidiary or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued
by the SBIC Subsidiary upon an event of default. 

The Company received exemptive relief from the
SEC to permit it to exclude the debentures guaranteed by the SBA of the SBIC Subsidiaries from the definition of senior securities in

99 

Corporate History 

We commenced operations, at the time known as
GSC Investment Corp., on March 23, 2007 and completed an initial public offering of shares of common stock on March 28, 2007. Prior to
July 30, 2010, we were externally managed and advised by GSCP (NJ), L.P., an entity affiliated with GSC Group, Inc. In connection with
the consummation of a recapitalization transaction on July 30, 2010, as described below we engaged Saratoga Investment Advisors to replace
GSCP (NJ), L.P. as our investment adviser and changed our name to Saratoga Investment Corp. 

Our wholly owned subsidiaries, Saratoga Investment
Corp. SBIC II LP SBIC II LP and Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC III LP SBIC III LP , and together with SBIC
II LP, the SBIC Subsidiaries ), received SBIC licenses from the SBA on August 14, 2019 and September 29, 2022, respectively.
Each of the SBIC Subsidiaries provides up to 175.0 million in long-term capital in the form of debentures guaranteed by the SBA. Our
wholly owned subsidiary SBIC LP repaid its outstanding debentures and subsequently surrendered its license to the SBA on January 3, 2024,
providing the Company access to all undistributed capital of SBIC LP, and SBIC LP subsequently merged with and into the Company. Under
current SBIC regulations, for two or more SBICs under common control, the maximum amount of outstanding SBA debentures cannot exceed
 350.0 million with at least 175.0 million in combined regulatory capital. 

On February 26, 2021, we completed the
fourth refinancing of the Saratoga CLO. This refinancing, among other things, extended the Saratoga CLO reinvestment period to April
2024, and extended its legal maturity to April 2033, and added a non-call period ending February 2022. In addition, and as part of the
refinancing, the Saratoga CLO was upsized from 500 million in assets to approximately 650 million. As part of this refinancing and
upsizing, we invested an additional 14.0 million in all of the newly issued subordinated notes of the Saratoga CLO, and purchased 17.9
million in aggregate principal amount of the Class F-R-3 Notes tranche at par. Concurrently, the existing 2.5 million of Class F-R-2
Notes, 7.5 million of Class G-R-2 Notes and 25.0 million CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan were repaid. We also paid 2.6 million of transaction
costs related to the refinancing and upsizing on behalf of the Saratoga CLO, to be reimbursed from future equity distributions. At
August 31, 2021, the outstanding receivable of 2.6 million was repaid. 

On June 10, 2024, the Company completed its fifth
refinancing of the Saratoga CLO. This refinancing, among other things, did not extend the Saratoga CLO reinvestment period nor extend
its legal maturity, while adjusting the interest rate of two of the existing Notes. The Issuer issued 422.5 million of notes (the 2013-1
2024 Reset CLO Notes ), consisting of Class A-1-R-4 and Class A-2-R-4. The 2013-1 2024 Reset CLO Notes were issued pursuant to
the Indenture with the same Trustee. Proceeds of the issuance of the 2013-1 2024 Reset CLO Notes were used along with existing assets
of the Saratoga CLO to redeem the existing Class A-1-R-3 and Class A-2-R-3 Notes. No other Notes were refinanced as part of this refinancing.
The Saratoga CLO paid 0.5 million of transaction costs related to the refinancing. 

We have formed a wholly owned special purpose
entity, Saratoga Investment Funding II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company SIF II ), for the purpose of entering
into a senior secured revolving credit facility with Encina Lender Finance, LLC Encina ), supported by loans held by SIF
II and pledged to Encina under the credit facility (the Encina Credit Facility). The Encina Credit Facility closed on October
4, 2021. During the first two years following the closing date, SIF II may request an increase in the commitment amount under the Encina
Credit Facility to up to 75.0 million. The terms of the Encina Credit Facility require a minimum drawn amount of 12.5 million at all
times during the first six months following the closing date, which increases to the greater of 25.0 million or 50 of the commitment
amount in effect at any time thereafter. The term of the Encina Credit Facility is three years. Advances under the Encina Credit Facility
bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 4.0 , with LIBOR having a floor of 0.75 , with customary provisions related
to our and Encina s selection of a replacement benchmark rate. Concurrently with the closing of the Encina Credit Facility, all
remaining amounts outstanding on our existing revolving credit facility with Madison Capital Funding, LLC were repaid and the facility
was terminated. On January 27, 2023, among other things, the borrowings available under the Encina Credit Facility was increased from
up to 50.0 million to up to 65.0 million, the underlying benchmark rate used to compute interest changed from LIBOR to Term SOFR for
one-month tenor plus a 0.10 credit spread adjustment; the applicable effective margin rate on borrowings increased from 4.00 to 4.25 
and the maturity date was extended from October 4, 2024 to January 27, 2026. 

100 

We have formed a wholly owned special purpose
entity, Saratoga Investment Funding III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company SIF III ), for the purpose of entering
into a senior secured revolving credit facility with Live Oak Banking Company Live Oak ), supported by loans held by SIF
III and pledged to Live Oak under the credit facility (the Live Oak Credit Facility). The Live Oak Credit Facility closed on March
27, 2024. During the first two years following the closing date, SIF III may request an increase in the commitment amount under the Live
Oak Credit Facility to up to 150.0 million. The terms of the Live Oak Credit Facility require a minimum drawn amount of 12.5 million
at all times during the period ending March 27, 2025, which increases to the greater of 25.0 million or 50 of the facility amount in
effect at any time thereafter. The term of the Live Oak Credit Facility is three years. Advances under the Live Oak Credit Facility bear
interest at a floating rate per annum equal to Adjusted Term SOFR plus an applicable margin between 3.50 and 4.25 based on the Live
Oak Credit Facility s utilization. On June 14, 2024, the Live Oak Credit Facility was amended to, among other things: (i)
increase the borrowings available under the Live Oak Credit Facility from up to 50.0 million to up to 75.0 million, subject to a borrowing
base requirement; (ii) add new lenders to the Live Oak Credit Agreement; (iii) replace administrative agent approval with Required
Lender (as defined in the Live Oak Credit Agreement) approval with respect to certain matters; (iv) replace Required Lender approval
with 100 lender approval with respect to certain matters; and (v) change the definition of Required Lender to require the approval of
at least two unaffiliated lenders. 

On October 26, 2021, we entered into a Limited
Liability Company Agreement with TJHA JV I LLC TJHA to co-manage Saratoga Senior Loan Fund I JV LLC SLF JV ).
SLF JV is invested in Saratoga Investment Corp Senior Loan Fund 2021-1 Ltd SLF 2021 ), which is a wholly owned subsidiary
of SLF JV. SLF 2021 was formed for the purpose of making investments in a diversified portfolio of broadly syndicated first lien and
second lien term loans or bonds in the primary and secondary markets. 

On September 30, 2022, SLF 2021 was renamed to
Saratoga Investment Corp Senior Loan Fund 2022-1, Ltd. SLF 2022 ). 

We and TJHA have equal voting interest on all
material decisions with respect to SLF JV, including those involving its investment portfolio, and equal control of corporate governance.
No management fee is charged to SLF JV as control and management of SLF JV is shared equally. 

We and TJHA have committed to provide up to a
combined 50.0 million of financing to SLF JV through cash contributions, where we provided 43.75 million and TJHA provides 6.25 million,
resulting in an 87.5 and 12.5 ownership between the two parties. The financing is issued in the form of an unsecured note and equity.
The unsecured note will pay a fixed rate of 10.0 per annum and is due and payable in full on October 20, 2033. As of August 31, 2024
our and TJHA s investment in SLF JV consisted of an unsecured note of 17.6 million and 2.5 million, respectively; and membership
interest of 17.6 million and 2.5 million, respectively. As of February 29, 2024, our and TJHA s investment in SLF JV consisted
of an unsecured note of 17.6 million and 2.5 million, respectively; and membership interest of 17.6 million and 2.5 million, respectively.
As of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, the Company s investment in the unsecured note of SLF JV had a fair value of 16.3
million and 15.8 million, respectively, and the Company s investment in the membership interests of SLF JV had a fair value of
 5.1 million and 9.4 million, respectively. 

SLF JV s initial investment in SLF 2022
was in the form of an unsecured loan. The unsecured loan paid a floating rate of LIBOR plus 7.00 per annum and was paid in full on June
9, 2023. The unsecured loan was repaid in full on October 28, 2022, as part of the CLO closing. 

We have determined that SLF JV is an investment
company under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 946, Financial Services Investment
Companies ; however, in accordance with such guidance we will generally not consolidate our investment in a company other than a wholly
owned investment company subsidiary. SLF JV is not a wholly owned investment company subsidiary as we and TJHA each have an equal 50 
voting interest in SLF JV and thus neither party has a controlling financial interest. Furthermore, FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidation ,
concludes that in a joint venture where both members have equal decision making authority, it is not appropriate for one member to consolidate
the joint venture since neither has control. Accordingly, we do not consolidate SLF JV. 

On October 28, 2022, SLF 2022 issued 402.1 million
of debt through the JV CLO trust. The 2022 JV CLO Notes were issued pursuant to the JV Indenture, with the Trustee. As part of the transaction,
we purchased 87.50 of the Class E Notes from SLF 2022 with a par value of 12.25 million. As of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024,
the fair value of these Class E Notes were 12.3 million and 12.3 million, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Basis of Presentation 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions
affecting amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We have identified investment valuation, revenue recognition and
the recognition of capital gains incentive fee expense as our most critical accounting estimates. We continuously evaluate our estimates,
including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us
and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from
those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates follows. 

Investment Valuation 

We account for investments at fair value in accordance
with the FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure
requirements for fair value measurements. Under ASC 820 we are required to assume that its investments are to be sold or its liabilities
are to be transferred at the balance sheet date in the principal market to independent market participants, or in the absence of a principal
market, in the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in
the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. 

Investments for which market quotations are readily
available are fair valued at such market quotations obtained from independent third-party pricing services and market makers subject
to any decision by our board of directors to approve a fair value determination to reflect significant events affecting the value of
these investments. We value investments for which market quotations are not readily available at fair value as approved, in good faith,
by our board of directors based on input from Saratoga Investment Advisors, the audit committee of our board of directors and a third
party independent valuation firm. We use multiple techniques for determining fair value based on the nature of the investment and experience
with those types of investments and specific portfolio companies. The selections of the valuation techniques and the inputs and assumptions
used within those techniques often require subjective judgements and estimates. These techniques include market comparables, discounted
cash flows and enterprise value waterfalls. Fair value is best expressed as a range of values from which we determines a single best
estimate. The types of inputs and assumptions that may be considered in determining the range of values of our investments include the
nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, market yield trend analysis and
volatility in future interest rates, call and put features, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly
traded companies, discounted cash flows and other relevant factors. 

We undertake a multi-step valuation process each
quarter when valuing investments for which market quotations are not readily available, as described below: 

each investment is initially valued by the responsible
 investment professionals of Saratoga Investment Advisors and preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with
 our senior management; and 

an independent valuation firm engaged by our board
 of directors independently reviews a selection of these preliminary valuations each quarter so that the valuation of each investment
 for which market quotes are not readily available is reviewed by the independent valuation firm at least once each fiscal year. We
 use a third-party independent valuation firm to value our investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO and the Class F-2-R-3
 Notes tranche of the Saratoga CLO every quarter. 

In addition, all our investments are subject to the following
valuation process: 

the audit committee of our board of directors reviews
 and approves each preliminary valuation and Saratoga Investment Advisors and an independent valuation firm (if applicable) will supplement
 the preliminary valuation to reflect any comments provided by the audit committee; and 

our board of directors discusses the valuations and
 approves the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of Saratoga Investment Advisors, independent valuation
 firm (to the extent applicable) and the audit committee of our board of directors. 

102 

Our investment in Saratoga CLO is carried at
fair value, which is based on a discounted cash flows that utilizes prepayment, re-investment and loss assumptions based on historical
experience and projected performance, economic factors, the characteristics of the underlying cash flow, and market comparables for equity
interests in collateralized loan obligation funds similar to Saratoga CLO, when available, as determined by Saratoga Investment Advisors
and recommended to our board of directors. Specifically, we use Intex cash flows, or an appropriate substitute, to form the basis for
the valuation of our investment in Saratoga CLO. The cash flows use a set of inputs including projected default rates, recovery rates,
reinvestment rates and prepayment rates in order to arrive at estimated valuations. The inputs are based on available market data and
projections provided by third parties as well as management estimates. We use the output from the Intex models (i.e., the estimated cash
flows) to perform a discounted cash flow analysis on expected future cash flows to determine a valuation for our investment in Saratoga
CLO. 

Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act Rule 2a-5 establishes a regulatory framework for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. Rule 2a-5 permits boards, subject
to board oversight and certain other conditions, to designate the investment adviser to perform fair value determinations. Rule 2a-5
also defines when market quotations are readily available for purposes of the 1940 Act and the threshold for determining
whether a fund must determine the fair value of a security. Rule 31a-4 under the 1940 Act Rule 31a-4 provides the recordkeeping
requirements associated with fair value determinations. While our board of directors has not elected to designate Saratoga Investment
Advisors as the valuation designee, we has adopted certain revisions to its valuation policies and procedures in order comply with the
applicable requirements of Rule 2a-5 and Rule 31a-4. 

Revenue Recognition 

Income Recognition 

Interest income, adjusted for amortization of
premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The
Company stops accruing interest on its investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Discounts and premiums
on investments purchased are accreted/amortized over the life of the respective investment using the effective yield method. The amortized
cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on investments. 

Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status
when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest is generally reserved when a loan is placed
on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as a reduction in principal depending upon management s
judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and,
in management s judgment, are likely to remain current, although we may make exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient
collateral value and is in the process of collection. 

Payment-in-Kind Interest 

We hold debt and preferred equity investments
in our portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind PIK interest provision. The PIK interest, which represents contractually
deferred interest added to the investment balance that is generally due at maturity, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the
extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We stop accruing PIK interest if we do not expect the issuer to be able to pay all
principal and interest when due. 

Revenues 

We generate revenue in the form of interest income
and capital gains on the debt investments that we hold and capital gains, if any, on equity interests that we may acquire. We expect
our debt investments, whether in the form of leveraged loans or mezzanine debt, to have terms of up to ten years, and to bear interest
at either a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt will be payable generally either quarterly or semi-annually. In some cases, our
debt or preferred equity investments may provide for a portion or all of the interest to be PIK. To the extent interest is PIK, it will
be payable through the increase of the principal amount of the obligation by the amount of interest due on the then-outstanding aggregate
principal amount of such obligation. The principal amount of the debt and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at
the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring, amendment, redemption or
diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance or investment management services and possibly consulting fees. Any such fees
will be generated in connection with our investments and recognized as earned. We may also invest in preferred equity or common equity
securities that pay dividends on a current basis. 

103 

On January 22, 2008, we entered into a collateral
management agreement with Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which we act as its collateral manager. The Saratoga CLO was initially refinanced
in October 2013 with its reinvestment period extended to October 2016. On November 15, 2016, we completed a second refinancing of the
Saratoga CLO with its reinvestment period extended to October 2018. 

On December 14, 2018, we completed a third refinancing
and upsize of the Saratoga CLO. The third Saratoga CLO refinancing, among other things, extended its reinvestment period to January 2021,
and extended its legal maturity date to January 2030, and added a non-call period of January 2020. Following this refinancing, the Saratoga
CLO portfolio increased from approximately 300.0 million in aggregate principal amount to approximately 500.0 million of predominantly
senior secured first lien term loans. In addition to refinancing its liabilities, we invested an additional 13.8 million in all of the
newly issued subordinated notes of the Saratoga CLO and also purchased 2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class F-R-2
and 7.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Class G-R-2 notes tranches at par, with a coupon of 3M USD LIBOR plus 8.75 and 3M
USD LIBOR plus 10.00 , respectively. As part of this refinancing, we also redeemed our existing 4.5 million aggregate amount of the
Class F notes tranche at par and the 20.0 million CLO 2013-1 Warehouse Loan was repaid. 

On February 11, 2020, we entered into an unsecured
loan agreement CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan with Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2, Ltd CLO 2013-1
Warehouse 2 ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 may borrow from time
to time up to 20.0 million from the Company in order to provide capital necessary to support warehouse activities. On October 23,
2020, the availability under the CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan was increased to 25.0 million, which was immediately fully drawn and, which
expires on August 20, 2021. The interest rate was also amended to be based on a pricing grid, starting at an annual rate of 3M USD LIBOR
+ 4.46 . During the fourth quarter ended February 28, 2021, the CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Ltd was repaid in full. 

On February 26, 2021, we completed the fourth
refinancing of the Saratoga CLO. This refinancing, among other things, extended the Saratoga CLO reinvestment period to April 2024, extended
its legal maturity to April 2033, and added a non-call period of February 2022. In addition, and as part of the refinancing, the Saratoga
CLO was upsized from 500 million in assets to approximately 650 million. As part of this refinancing and upsizing, the Company
invested an additional 14.0 million in all of the newly issued subordinated notes of the Saratoga CLO, and purchased 17.9 million
in aggregate principal amount of the Class F-R-3 Notes tranche at par. Concurrently, the existing 2.5 million of
Class F-R-2 Notes, 7.5 million of Class G-R-2 Notes and 25.0 million of the CLO 2013-1 Warehouse 2 Loan were repaid.
We also paid 2.6 million of transaction costs related to the refinancing and upsizing on behalf of the Saratoga CLO, to be reimbursed
from future equity distributions. At August 31, 2021, the outstanding receivable of 2.6 million was repaid in full. 

On August 9, 2021, we exchanged our existing
 17.9 million Class F-R-3 Notes for 8.5 million Class F-1-R-3 Notes and 9.4 million Class F-2-R-3 Notes at par. On August 11, 2021,
we sold our Class F-1-R-3 Notes to third parties, resulting in a realized loss of 0.1 million. 

On June 10, 2024, the Company completed its fifth
refinancing of the Saratoga CLO. This refinancing, among other things, did not extend the Saratoga CLO reinvestment period nor extend
its legal maturity, while adjusting the interest rate of two of the existing Notes. The Issuer issued 422.5 million of notes, consisting
of Class A-1-R-4 and Class A-2-R-4. The 2013-1 2024 Reset CLO Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture with the same Trustee. Proceeds
of the issuance of the 2013-1 2024 Reset CLO Notes were used along with existing assets of the Saratoga CLO to redeem the existing Class
A-1-R-3 and Class A-2-R-3 Notes. No other Notes were refinanced as part of this refinancing. The Saratoga CLO paid 0.5 million of transaction
costs related to the refinancing. 

The Saratoga CLO remains effectively 100 owned
and managed by Saratoga Investment Corp. We receive a base management fee of 0.10 per annum and a subordinated management fee of 0.40 
per annum of the outstanding principal amount of Saratoga CLO s assets, paid quarterly to the extent of available proceeds. Prior
to the second refinancing and the issuance of the 2013-1 Amended CLO Notes, we received a base management fee of 0.25 per annum and
a subordinated management fee of 0.25 per annum of the outstanding principal amount of Saratoga CLO s assets, paid quarterly to
the extent of available proceeds. 

104 

Following the third refinancing and the issuance
of the 2013-1 Reset CLO Notes on December 14, 2018, we are no longer entitled to an incentive management fee equal to 20.0 of excess
cash flow to the extent the Saratoga CLO subordinated notes receive an internal rate of return paid in cash equal to or greater than
12.0 . 

Interest income on our investment in Saratoga
CLO is recorded using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 325-40, Investments-Other, Beneficial
Interests in Securitized Financial Assets, based on the anticipated yield and the estimated cash flows over the projected life of the
investment. Yields are revised when there are changes in actual or estimated cash flows due to changes in prepayments and/or re-investments,
credit losses or asset pricing. Changes in estimated yield are recognized as an adjustment to the estimated yield over the remaining
life of the investment from the date the estimated yield was changed. 

On October 26, 2021, the Company and TJHA entered
into the LLC Agreement to co-manage SLF JV. SLF JV is invested in Saratoga Investment Corp Senior Loan Fund 2022-1, Ltd SLF 2021 ),
which is a wholly owned subsidiary of SLF JV. SLF 2021 was formed for the purpose of making investments in a diversified portfolio of
broadly syndicated first lien and second lien term loans or bonds in the primary and secondary markets. 

The Company and TJHA have equal voting interest
on all material decisions with respect to SLF JV, including those involving its investment portfolio, and equal control of corporate
governance. No management fee is charged to SLF JV as control and management of SLF JV is shared equally. 

The Company and TJHA have committed to provide
up to a combined 50.0 million of financing to SLF JV through cash contributions, with the Company providing 43.75 million and TJHA
providing 6.25 million, resulting in an 87.5 and 12.5 ownership between the two parties. The financing is issued in the form of an
unsecured note and equity. The unsecured note pays a fixed rate of 10 per annum and is due and payable in full on October 20, 2033. 

The Company records interest income from its
investment in an unsecured loan with SLF JV on an accrual basis and records dividend income from its membership interest when earned.
All operating decisions are shared with a 50 voting interest in SLF JV.

105 

investment advisory and management fees; 

fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants
 or other advisers, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments; 

transfer agent and custodial fees; 

federal and state registration fees; 

all costs of registration and listing our common stock
 on any securities exchange; 

U.S. federal, state and local taxes;

costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents
 required by governmental bodies (including the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and the SBA); 

costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices

our fidelity bond, directors and officers errors and
 omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; 

direct costs and expenses of administration, including
 printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs; and 

administration fees and all other expenses incurred
 by us or, if applicable, the administrator in connection with administering our business (including payments under the Administration
 Agreement based upon our allocable portion of the administrator s overhead in performing its obligations under an Administration
 Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our officers and their respective staffs (including travel expenses)). 

Pursuant to the investment advisory and management
agreement that we had with GSCP (NJ), L.P., our former investment adviser and administrator, we had agreed to pay GSCP (NJ), L.P. as
investment adviser a quarterly base management fee of 1.75 of the average value of our total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents
but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters and an incentive fee. 

The incentive fee had two parts: 

A fee, payable quarterly in arrears, equal to 20.0 
 of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the net assets at the end of the immediately
 preceding quarter, that exceeded a 1.875 quarterly hurdle rate measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision,
 in any fiscal quarter, our investment adviser received no incentive fee unless our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeded
 the hurdle rate of 1.875 . Amounts received as a return of capital were not included in calculating this portion of the incentive
 fee. Since the hurdle rate was based on net assets, a return of less than the hurdle rate on total assets could still have resulted
 in an incentive fee. 

A fee, payable at the end of each fiscal year, equal
 to 20.0 of our net realized capital gains, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation,
 in each case on a cumulative basis on each investment in our portfolio, less the aggregate amount of capital gains incentive fees
 paid to the investment adviser through such date. 

We deferred cash payment of any incentive fee
otherwise earned by our former investment adviser if, during the then most recent four full fiscal quarters ending on or prior to the
date such payment was to be made, the sum of (a) our aggregate distributions to our stockholders and (b) our change in net assets (defined
as total assets less liabilities) (before taking into account any incentive fees payable during that period) was less than 7.5 of our
net assets at the beginning of such period. These calculations were appropriately pro-rated for the first three fiscal quarters of operation
and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable period. Such incentive fee would become payable on the next
date on which such test had been satisfied for the most recent four full fiscal quarters or upon certain terminations of the investment
advisory and management agreement. We commenced deferring cash payment of incentive fees during the quarterly period ended August 31,
2007 and continued to defer such payments through the quarterly period ended May 31, 2010. As of July 30, 2010, the date on which GSCP
(NJ), L.P. ceased to be our investment adviser and administrator, we owed GSCP (NJ), L.P. 2.9 million in fees for services previously
provided to us; of which 0.3 million has been paid by us. GSCP (NJ), L.P. agreed to waive payment by us of the remaining 2.6 million
in connection with the consummation of the stock purchase transaction with Saratoga Investment Advisors and certain of its affiliates
described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 

106 

The terms of the investment advisory and management
agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors, our current investment adviser, are substantially similar to the terms of the investment
advisory and management agreement we had entered into with GSCP (NJ), L.P., our former investment adviser, except for the following material
distinctions in the fee terms: 

The capital gains portion of the incentive fee was
 reset with respect to gains and losses from May 31, 2010, and therefore losses and gains incurred prior to such time will not be
 taken into account when calculating the capital gains fee payable to Saratoga Investment Advisors and, as a result, Saratoga Investment
 Advisors will be entitled to 20.0 of net gains that arise after May 31, 2010. In addition, the cost basis for computing realized
 gains and losses on investments held by us as of May 31, 2010 equal the fair value of such investment as of such date. Under the
 investment advisory and management agreement with our former investment adviser, GSCP (NJ), L.P., the capital gains fee was calculated
 from March 21, 2007, and the gains were substantially outweighed by losses. 

Under the catch up provision, 100.0 
 of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income that
 exceeds 1.875 but is less than or equal to 2.344 in any fiscal quarter is payable to Saratoga Investment Advisors. This will enable
 Saratoga Investment Advisors to receive 20.0 of all net investment income as such amount approaches 2.344 in any quarter, and Saratoga
 Investment Advisors will receive 20.0 of any additional net investment income. Under the investment advisory and management agreement
 with our former investment adviser, GSCP (NJ), L.P. only received 20.0 of the excess net investment income over 1.875 . 

We will no longer have deferral rights regarding incentive
 fees in the event that the distributions to stockholders and change in net assets is less than 7.5 for the preceding four fiscal
 quarters. 

Capital Gains Incentive Fee 

We record an expense accrual relating to the
capital gains incentive fee payable by us to the Manager when the unrealized gains on its investments exceed all realized capital losses
on its investments given the fact that a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Manager if we were to liquidate our investment
portfolio at such time. The actual incentive fee payable to the Company s Manager related to capital gains will be determined and
payable in arrears at the end of each fiscal year and will include only realized capital gains for the period.

for the three months ended August 31, 2023. Interest income from investments primarily increased due to the increase of the weighted
average current yield on investments to 11.5 at August 31, 2024, up from 11.3 at August 31, 2023, mainly resulting from the recognition
of 7.9 million interest income related to our Knowland investment that was previously on non-accrual.

investment income increased 11.5 million, or 16.4 , to 81.7 million from 70.1 million for the six months ended August 31, 2023. Interest
income from investments increased 11.8 million, or 19.0 , to 73.7 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024 from 61.9 million
for the six months ended August 31, 2023. Interest income from investments primarily increased due to the increase of the weighted average
current yield on investments to 11.5 as of August 31, 2024, up from 11.3 at August 31, 2023, mainly resulting from the recognition
of 7.9 million interest income related to our Knowland investment that was previously on non-accrual.

2024 and August 31, 2023, total PIK income was 1.9 million and 0.9 million, respectively and 2.5 million and 1.3 million, respectively.
The increase in both periods primarily related to the recognition of PIK income on our Knowland investment that was previously on non-accrual. 

For the three months ended August 31, 2024 and
August 31, 2023, interest from cash and cash equivalents was 1.7 million and 0.5 million, respectively. The increase of 1.2 million
for the quarter ended August 31, 2024 was due to increased cash and cash equivalents balances during this period as compared to last
year, resulting from numerous repayments received during the quarter. 

For the six months ended August 31, 2024 and
August 31, 2023, interest from cash and cash equivalents was 2.3 million and 1.3 million, respectively. The increase of 1.0 million

six months ended August 31, 2023. 

For the three and six months ended August 31,
2024 and August 31, 2023, total structuring and advisory fee income was 0.0 million and 0.0 million, respectively and 0.0 million

operating expenses increased 3.3 million, or 15.1 , compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. For the six months ended August
31, 2024, total operating expenses increased 8.9 million, or 22.2 , compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. 

For the three months ended August 31, 2024, interest
and debt financing expenses increased 0.7 million, or 5.8 , compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. The increase is primarily
attributable to an increase of 3.4 in average outstanding debt from 809.0 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 to 836.9
million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. 

For the six months ended August 31, 2024, interest
and debt financing expenses increased 2.0 million, or 8.2 , compared to the six months ended August 31, 2023. The increase is primarily
attributable to an increase of 5.0 in average outstanding debt from 795.0 million for the six months ended August 31, 2023 to 835.0
million for the six months ended August 31, 2024. 

For the three and six months ended August 31,
2024 and August 31, 2023, the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness was 6.06 and 6.01 , respectively and 6.06 
and 5.66 , respectively. The increase in weighted average interest rate was primarily driven by the issuance of higher rate borrowings
over the past year, primarily last year, reflecting the increase in base rates in the market at that time.

the SBA debentures represented 25.5 and 26.1 of overall debt, respectively.

management fees decreased 0.07 million, or 1.5 , from 4.8 million to 4.8 million compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023.
The decrease in base management fees results from the 1.8 decrease in the average value of our total assets, less cash and cash equivalents,
from 1,100.5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 to 1,080.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. 

For the six months ended August 31, 2024, base
management fees increased 0.3 million, or 3.7 , from 9.7 million to 9.4 million compared to the six months ended August 31, 2023.
The increase in base management fees results from the 3.4 increase in the average value of our total assets, less cash and cash equivalents,
from 1,069.0 million for the six months ended August 31, 2023 to 1,105.1 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024. 

114 

For the three months ended August 31, 2024, incentive
management fees increased 2.1 million, or 83.4 , compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. The incentive fee on income increased
from 3.3 million to 4.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, reflecting the increase in net investment
income during the three months ended August 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. The incentive fee on capital
gains decreased from a (0.8) million benefit for the three months ended August 31, 2023 to a (0.9) million benefit for the three months
ended August 31, 2024, reflecting the incentive fee on net realized and unrealized depreciation recognized during both these periods,
with the liability floor capped at zero. 

For the six months ended August 31, 2024, incentive
management fees increased 5.6 million, or 214.7 , compared to the six months ended August 31, 2023. The incentive fee on income increased
from 6.5 million to 8.1 million for the six months ended August 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, reflecting the increase in net investment
income during the six months ended August 31, 2024 as compared to the six months ended August 31, 2023. The incentive fee on capital
gains increased from a (3.9) million benefit for the six months ended August 31, 2023 to a (3.7) million benefit for the six months
ended August 31, 2024, reflecting the incentive fee on net realized and unrealized depreciation recognized during both these periods,
with the liability floor capped at zero. 

For the three months ended August 31, 2024, professional
fees decreased 0.4 million, or 74.1 , from 0.5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 to 0.1 million for the three months
ended August 31, 2023. 

For the six months ended August 31, 2024, professional
fees increased 0.2 million, or 15.7 , from 1.0 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024 to 1.1 million for the six months
ended August 31, 2023. 

For the three and six months ended August 31,
2024, administrator expenses increased 0.2 million, or 25.3 and 0.5 million, or 28.2 , respectively compared to the three and six
months ended August 31, 2023, reflecting the contractual changes to the administrator agreement cap.

2024, general and administrative expenses increased 0.4 million, or 75.9 and 0.1 million, or 10.2 , respectively compared to the three
and six months ended August 31, 2023. 

As discussed above, the increase in interest
and debt financing expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023 is attributable
both to an increase in the average dollar amount of outstanding debt, as well as the higher cost of that debt. For the three months ended
August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the average borrowings outstanding under the Encina Credit Facility was 32.5 million and 35.0
million, respectively, and the average weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowing under the Encina Credit Facility was
9.89 and 9.75 , respectively. For the three months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the average borrowings outstanding under
the Live Oak Credit Facility was 19.0 million and 0.0 million, respectively, and the average weighted average interest rate on the
outstanding borrowing under the Live Oak Credit Facility was 9.55 and 0.0 , respectively. For the three months ended August 31, 2024
and August 31, 2023, the average borrowings outstanding of SBA debentures was 214.0 million and 202.6 million, respectively. For the

of our Notes Payable was 571.4 million and 571.4 million, respectively. For the three months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023,
the weighted average interest rate on the Notes Payable was 6.06 and 5.92 , respectively. 

As discussed above, the increase in interest
and debt financing expenses for the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2023 is attributable
both to an increase in the average dollar amount of outstanding debt, as well as the higher cost of that debt. For the six months ended
August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the average borrowings outstanding under the Encina Credit Facility was 33.6 million and 40.9
million, respectively, and the average weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowing under the Encina Credit Facility was
9.89 and 9.56 , respectively. For the six months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the average borrowings outstanding under
the Live Oak Credit Facility was 16.0 million and 0.0 million, respectively, and the average weighted average interest rate on the

of 7.9 million. Based on 12,158,440 weighted average common shares outstanding as of August 31, 2023, our per share net decrease in

For the six months ended August 31, 2024, we
recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 19.9 million. Based on 13,704,759 weighted average common shares

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

We intend to continue to generate cash primarily
from cash flows from operations, including interest earned from our investments in debt in middle-market companies, interest earned from
the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less,
the Encina Credit Facility and the Live Oak Credit Facility, our continued access to the SBA debentures future borrowings and future
offerings of debt and equity securities. 

Although we expect to fund the growth of our
investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future equity offerings, including our dividend reinvestment plan DRIP ),
our equity ATM Program (as defined below), and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940
Act, we cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital will be successful. In this regard, because our common stock has historically
traded at a price below our current NAV per share and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below NAV per
share, we have been and may continue to be limited in our ability to raise equity capital. 

In addition, we intend to distribute to our stockholders
substantially all of our operating taxable income in order to satisfy the distribution requirement applicable to RICs under the Code.
In satisfying this distribution requirement, in accordance with certain applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury regulations
and a revenue procedure issued by the Internal Revenue Service IRS ), a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as
fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or
stock of the RIC subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20 
of the aggregate declared distribution. We may rely on the revenue procedure in future periods to satisfy our RIC distribution requirement. 

Also, as a BDC, we generally are required to
meet a coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to total senior securities,
which include all of our borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock, of at least 200 , reduced to 150 effective April 16, 2019 following
the approval received from our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, on April 16, 2018. This requirement
limits the amount that we may borrow. Our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, was 159.6 as of August 31, 2024 and 161.1 
as of February 29, 2024. To fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future, we anticipate needing to raise additional capital
from various sources, including the equity markets and other public and private debt-related markets, which may or may not be available
on favorable terms, if at all. 

Consequently, we may not have the funds or the
ability to fund new investments, to make additional investments in our portfolio companies, to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio
companies, to pay dividends or to repay borrowings. Also, the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to
sell these investments when desired and, if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded
value. 

Due to the diverse capital sources available
to us at this time, we believe we have adequate liquidity to support our near term capital requirements. 

Encina Credit Facility 

Below is a summary of the terms of the Encina
Credit Facility. 

Commitment . We entered into the Credit
and Security Agreement (the Encina Credit Agreement relating to the Encina Credit Facility in the initial facility amount
of 50.0 million (the Encina Facility Amount ). 

119 

Availability . We can draw up to the lesser
of (i) the Encina Facility Amount and (ii) the Borrowing Base. The Borrowing Base is an amount equal to (i) the difference of (A) the
product of the applicable advance rate which varies from 50.0 to 75.0 depending on the type of loan asset (Defaulted Loans being excluded
in that they carry an advance rate of 0 and the value, determined in accordance with the Encina Credit Facility (the Adjusted
Borrowing Value ), of certain eligible loan assets pledged as security for the loan (the Borrowing Base Value and (B) the Excess Concentration Amount, as calculated in accordance with the Encina Credit Facility, plus (ii) any amounts held in the
Prefunding Account and, without duplication, Excess Cash held in the Collection Account, less (iii) the product of (a) the amount of
any undrawn funding commitments we have under any loan asset and (b) the Unfunded Exposure Haircut Percentage, and less (iv) 100,000.
Each loan asset we held as of the date on which the Encina Credit Facility was closed was valued as of that date and each loan asset
that we acquire after such date will be valued at the lowest of its fair value, its face value (excluding accrued interest) and the purchase
price paid for such loan asset. Adjustments to the value of a loan asset will be made to reflect, among other things and under certain
circumstances, changes in its fair value, a default by the obligor on the loan asset, insolvency of the obligor, acceleration of the
loan asset, and certain modifications to the terms of the loan asset. 

The Encina Credit Facility contains limitations
on the type of loan assets that are eligible to be included in the Borrowing Base and as to the concentration level of
certain categories of loan assets in the Borrowing Base such as restrictions on geographic and industry concentrations, asset size and
quality, payment frequency, status and terms, average life, and collateral interests. In addition, if an asset is to remain an eligible 
loan asset, we may not make changes to the payment, amortization, collateral and certain other terms of the loan assets without the consent
of the administrative agent that will either result in subordination of the loan asset or be materially adverse to the lenders. 

The Encina Credit Facility requires certain minimum
drawn amounts. For the period beginning on the closing date and ended April 4, 2022, the minimum funding amount was 12.5 million. For
the period beginning on April 5, 2022 through maturity, the minimum funding amount is the greater of 25.0 million and 50 of the Encina
Facility Amount in effect from time to time. 

Collateral . The Encina Credit Facility
is secured by assets of SIF II and pledged to Encina under the Encina Credit Facility. SIF II is a wholly owned special purpose entity
formed for the purpose of entering into the Encina Credit Facility. 

Interest Rate and Fees . Under the Encina
Credit Facility, funds were borrowed from or through certain lenders at the greater of the prevailing LIBOR rate and 0.75 , plus an applicable
margin of 4.00 . The Encina Credit Agreement includes benchmark replacement provisions which permit the Administrative Agent and the
borrower to select a replacement rate upon the unavailability of LIBOR. In addition, we pay the lenders a commitment fee of 0.75 per
year (or 0.50 if the ratio of advances outstanding to aggregate commitments is greater than or equal to 50 on the unused amount of
the Encina Credit Facility for the duration of the term of the Encina Credit Facility. Accrued interest and commitment fees are payable
monthly in arrears. We were also obligated to pay certain other fees to the lenders in connection with the closing of the Encina Credit
Facility. 

120 

Collateral
Tests . It is a condition precedent to any borrowing under the Encina Credit Facility that the principal amount outstanding under
the Encina Credit Facility, after giving effect to the proposed borrowings, not exceed the Borrowing Base (the Borrowing Base
Test ). In addition to satisfying the Borrowing Base Test, the following tests must also be satisfied (together with Borrowing
Base Test, the Collateral Tests ): 

o 
 Interest
 Coverage Ratio. The ratio (expressed as a percentage) of interest collections with respect to pledged loan assets, less certain
 fees and expenses relating to the Encina Credit Facility, to accrued interest and commitment fees payable to the lenders under the
 Encina Credit Facility for the last 6 payment periods must equal at least 175.0 . 

o 
 Overcollateralization
 Ratio. The ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the aggregate Adjusted Borrowing Value of eligible pledged loan
 assets plus the fair value of certain ineligible pledged loan assets (in each case, subject to certain adjustments) to outstanding
 borrowings under the Encina Credit Facility plus the Unfunded Exposure Amount must equal at least 200.0 . 

The
Encina Credit Facility also may require payment of outstanding borrowings or replacement of pledged loan assets upon our breach of our
representation and warranty that pledged loan assets included in the Borrowing Base are eligible loan assets. Such ineligible
collateral loans will be excluded from the calculation of the Borrowing Base and may lead to a Borrowing Base Deficiency, which may be
cured by effecting one or more (or any combination thereof) of the following actions: (A) deposit into or credit to the collection account
cash and eligible investments, (B) repay outstanding borrowings (together with certain costs and expenses), (C) sell or substitute loan
assets in accordance with the Encina Credit Facility, or (D) pledge additional loan assets as collateral. Compliance with the Collateral
Tests is also a condition to the discretionary sale of pledged loan assets by us. 

Priority
of Payments . The priority of payments provisions of the Encina Credit Facility require, after payment of specified fees and expenses,
that collections of interest from the loan assets and, to the extent that these are insufficient, collections of principal from the loan
assets, be applied on each payment date to payment of outstanding borrowings if the Borrowing Base Test, the Overcollateralization Ratio
and the Interest Coverage Ratio would not otherwise be met. 

Operating
Expenses . The priority of payments provision of the Encina Credit Facility provides for the payment of certain of our operating expenses
out of collections on interest and principal in accordance with the priority established in such provision. The operating expenses payable
pursuant to the priority of payment provisions is limited to 200,000 per annum. 

Covenants;
Representations and Warranties; Events of Default . The Encina Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties,

by us of any negative covenants or of certain of the affirmative covenants, including, without limitation, those related to preservation
of the existence and separateness of the Company. Other events of default under the Encina Credit Agreement include, among other things,

 all times a majority of the board of directors (or similar governing body) of Saratoga Investment Advisor and to direct the management
 policies and decisions of Saratoga Investment Advisor, or (ii) the dissolution, termination or liquidation in whole or in part, transfer

the Encina Credit Facility and the carrying out of any and all acts contemplated thereunder up to and as of the date of closing. These
amounts totaled 1.4 million. 

On

increase
 the borrowings available under the Encina Credit Facility from up to 50.0 million to up to 65.0 million;

reflect, among other things and under certain circumstances, changes in its fair value, a default by the obligor on the loan asset, insolvency

SBA-guaranteed
debentures 

In
addition, we, through two current wholly owned subsidiaries, sought and obtained licenses from the SBA to operate an SBIC. In this regard,
our wholly owned subsidiaries, SBIC II LP, and SBIC III LP, received an SBIC license from the SBA on August 14, 2019, and September 29,
2022, respectively. SBICs are designated to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations,
SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses. Our wholly owned subsidiary
SBIC LP fully repaid its outstanding debentures and subsequently surrendered its license to the SBA on January 3, 2023, and SBIC LP subsequently
merged with and into the Company. 

The
SBIC license allows our SBIC Subsidiaries to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse,
interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten-year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures
is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures
is fixed on a semi-annual basis at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities. 

The
SBIC Subsidiaries are regulated by the SBA. SBA regulations currently limit the amount that our SBIC Subsidiaries may individually borrow
up to a maximum of 175.0 million of SBA debentures if the SBIC Subsidiary has at least 87.5 million in regulatory capital, subject
to the SBA s approval. Under current SBIC regulations, for two or more SBICs under common control, the maximum amount of outstanding
SBA debentures cannot exceed 350.0 million. The SBIC Subsidiaries are able to borrow funds from the SBA against regulatory capital (which
generally approximates equity capital in the respective SBIC) and are subject to customary regulatory requirements, including, but not
limited to, periodic examination by the SBA. 

We
received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC Subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition
of senior securities in the asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. This allows us increased flexibility under the asset coverage test
by permitting us to borrow up to 350.0 million more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief.
On April 16, 2018, as permitted by the Small Business Credit Availability Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, our board
of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, approved of our becoming subject to a minimum asset coverage ratio of
150 from 200 under Sections 18(a)(1) and 18(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act, as amended. The 150 asset coverage ratio became effective
on April 16, 2019. 

As
of August 31, 2024 SBIC II LP had 87.5 million in regulatory capital and 175.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding and
SBIC III LP had 66.7 million in regulatory capital and 39.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding.

 was calculated based on a price of 21.76 per share, which equaled 95 of the volume weighted
 average trading price per share of the common stock on June 13, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25,
 26, and 27, 2024. 

(47)

 stock, or 10.0 of our outstanding common stock prior to the dividend payment. The number of shares of common stock comprising the
 stock portion was calculated based on a price of 22.08 per share, which equaled 95 of the volume weighted average trading price
 per share of the common stock on September 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, and 26, 2024.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Our
business activities contain elements of market risk. We consider the fluctuation in interest rates to be our principal market risk. Managing
this risk is essential to our business. Accordingly, we have systems and procedures designed to identify and analyze our risks, to establish
appropriate policies and thresholds and to continually monitor this risk and thresholds by means of administrative and information technology
systems and other policies and processes. 

Interest
rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, including relative changes in
different interest rates, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities
and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest
income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection
with our interest-bearing debt and liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire
leveraged loans, high yield bonds and other debt investments and the value of our investment portfolio. 

Our
investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates, including SOFR and the prime rate. Substantially all of our
portfolio is, and we expect will continue to be, comprised of floating rate investments that utilize SOFR or an alternate rate. Since
March 2022, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in response to ongoing inflation concerns. Although the Federal Reserve
left its benchmark rates steady in the second quarter of 2024, and it has indicated that any cuts to benchmark rates in the future will
depend on better inflation reports. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will not make upwards adjustments to the federal
funds rate in the future. In a high interest rate environment, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment
income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. It is possible that the Federal
Reserve s tightening cycle could result in a recession in the United States, which would likely decrease interest rates. A prolonged
reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such
decreases in base rates, such as SOFR, are not offset by corresponding increases in the spread over such base rates that we earn on any
portfolio investments, a decrease in in our operating expenses, including with respect to our income incentive fee, or a decrease in
the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities. Our interest expense is affected by fluctuations in SOFR on our Encina Credit
Facility and Live Oak Credit Facility. In addition, all of our assets have been transitioned from LIBOR to an acceptable replacement
rate, such as SOFR. At August 31, 2024, we had 785.4 million of borrowings outstanding. In addition, as of August 31, 2024, there were
 32.5 million borrowings outstanding under the Encina Credit Facility and 20.0 million borrowings outstanding under the Live Oak Credit
Facility. 

We
have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income from investments. Assuming that our investments as
of August 31, 2024 were to remain constant for a full fiscal year and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate terms,
a hypothetical change of a 1.0 increase in interest rates would cause a corresponding increase of approximately 9.3 million to our
interest income. Conversely, a hypothetical change of a 1.0 decrease in interest rates would cause a corresponding decrease of approximately
 9.2 million to our interest income. 

Changes
in interest rates would have no impact to our current interest and debt financing expense, as all our borrowings except for our credit
facilities are fixed rate. 

Although management believes that this measure
is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size and composition
of the assets on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and other business developments that could magnify or diminish
our sensitivity to interest rate changes, nor does it account for divergences in SOFR and the commercial paper rate, which have historically
moved in tandem but, in times of unusual credit dislocations, have experienced periods of divergence. Accordingly, no assurances can
be given that actual results would not materially differ from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate. 

136 

For
further information, the following table shows the approximate annualized increase or decrease in the components of net investment income
due to hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, assuming no changes in our investments and borrowings as of August 31, 2024.

ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a) 
 As
 of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
 our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
 of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act
 of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial
 officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in facilitating timely decisions regarding
 required disclosure of any material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit
 under the Exchange Act. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and
 procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives,
 and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
 procedures. 

(b) 
 There
 have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
 Act) that occurred during the quarter ended August 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
 affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.
OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.
Legal Proceedings 

Neither
we nor our wholly owned subsidiaries, Saratoga Investment Funding LLC, Saratoga Investment Funding II, LLC, Saratoga Investment Corp.
SBIC LP, Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC II LP, or Saratoga Investment Corp. SBIC III LP, are currently subject to any material legal
proceedings. 

We are exposed to risks associated with
changes in interest rates including potential effects on our cost of capital and net investment income. 

General interest rate fluctuations and changes
in credit spreads on floating rate loans may have a substantial negative impact on our investments and investment opportunities and,
accordingly, may have a material adverse effect on our rate of return on invested capital. In addition, in response to market indicators
showing a rise in inflation, since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has been increasing interest rates. While the Federal Reserve cut
its benchmark rate in the third quarter of 2024 for the first time since March 2020 and indicated that there may be additional rate cuts
in 2024, future reductions to benchmark rates are not certain. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve
will not make upwards adjustments to the federal funds rate in the future. An increase in interest rates would make it more expensive
to use debt to finance our investments. Decreases in credit spreads on debt that pays a floating rate of return would have an impact
on the income generation of our floating rate assets. Trading prices for debt that pays a fixed rate of return tend to fall as interest
rates rise. Trading prices tend to fluctuate more for fixed rate securities that have longer maturities. Although we have no policy governing
the maturities of our investments, under current market conditions we expect that we will invest in a portfolio of debt generally having
maturities of up to ten years. This means that we will be subject to greater risk (other things being equal) than an entity investing
solely in shorter-term securities. 

Because we may borrow to fund our investments,
a portion of our net investment income may be dependent upon the difference between the interest rate at which we borrow funds and the
interest rate at which we invest these funds. A portion of our investments will have fixed interest rates, while a portion of our borrowings
will likely have floating interest rates. As a result, a significant change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect
on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds could increase, which would reduce our net investment
income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. Further, rising interest
rates could also adversely affect our performance if we hold investments with floating interest rates, subject to specified minimum (or
 floor interest rates, while at the same time engaging in borrowings subject to floating interest rates not subject to
such minimums. In such a scenario, rising interest rates may temporarily increase our interest expense, even though our interest income
from investments is not increasing in a corresponding manner if market rates remain lower than the existing floor rate. If general interest
rates rise, there is also a risk that the portfolio companies in which we hold floating rate securities will be unable to pay escalating
interest amounts, which could result in a default under their loan documents with us. Rising interest rates could also cause portfolio
companies to shift cash from other productive uses to the payment of interest, which may have a material adverse effect on their business
and operations and could, over time, lead to increased defaults. In addition, rising interest rates may increase pressure on us to provide
fixed rate loans to our portfolio companies, which could adversely affect our net investment income, as increases in our cost of borrowed
funds would not be accompanied by increased interest income from such fixed-rate investments. 

We may hedge against such interest rate fluctuations
by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts, subject to applicable legal requirements, including
without limitation, all necessary registrations (or exemptions from registration) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. These
activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged borrowings. Adverse
developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

Item 2.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities 

On
September 24, 2014, the Company announced the approval of an open market share repurchase plan that originally allowed it to repurchase
up to 200,000 shares of its common stock at prices below its NAV as reported in its then most recently published consolidated financial
statements (the Share Repurchase Plan ). Since September 24, 2014, the Share Repurchase Plan has been extended annually,
and the Company has periodically increased the amount of shares of common stock that may be purchased under the Share Repurchase Plan,
most recently to 1.7 million shares of common stock. On January 8, 2024, the Company s board of directors extended the Share Repurchase
Plan for another year to January 15, 2025. As of August 31, 2024, the Company had purchased 1,035,203 shares of common stock, at the
average price of 22.05 for approximately 22.8 million pursuant to the Share Repurchase Plan. During the three and six months ended
August 31, 2024, the Company did not purchase any shares of common stock pursuant to the Share Repurchase Plan.
