 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates as previously reported in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Traditionally, the Company s sales and profits are stronger in the second and third quarters and weaker in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, due to the seasonal nature of the Westcott back-to-school market. 
 Net sales 
 Consolidated net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 48,166,000 compared to 50,384,000 in the same period in 2023, a decrease of 4 . Excluding the impact of the Camillus and Cuda hunting and fishing product lines sold on November 1, 2023, sales for the third quarter of 2024 increased 4 , compared to the same period in 2023. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 148,547,000 compared to 149,559,000 in the same period in 2023, a decrease of 1 . Excluding Camillus and Cuda, sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5 compared to the same period in 2023. These results reflect the fact that revenues and earnings of the Camillus and Cuda business historically have been seasonal, with the largest shipments occurring in the third quarter in connection with the hunting season, holiday sales and promotions. This disproportionately impacted the sales and earnings for the third quarter of 2024. 
 Net sales in the U.S. for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 6 compared to the same period in 2023. Excluding the impact of Camillus and Cuda, net sales for the third quarter of 2024 increased 3 compared to the same period of 2023. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1 compared to the same period in 2023. Excluding the impact of Camillus and Cuda, net sales for the 
 17 

nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase in net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to market share gains in the craft channel, the kitchen sharpener market as well as first aid products. 
 Net sales in Canada for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1 in U.S. dollars but increased 2 in local currency compared to the same period in 2023. Excluding the impact of Camillus and Cuda, net sales for the third quarter of 2024 increased 6 compared to the same period of 2023. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 5 in U.S. dollars and 4 in local currency, compared to the same period in 2023. Excluding the impact of Camillus and Cuda, net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were constant compared to the same period of 2023. Sales of first aid products were strong, however sales of school and office products declined due to a continuing soft economy. 
 European net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 10 in both U.S. dollars and local currency compared to the same period in 2023. Excluding the impact of Camillus and Cuda, net sales for the third quarter of 2024 increased 15 compared to the same period of 2023. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6 in both U.S. dollars and local currency compared to the same period in 2023. Excluding the impact of Camillus and Cuda, net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 10 compared to the same period of 2023. The increases in net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to market share gains in the office channel.

 Financial Condition 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, working capital increased approximately 10.4 million. As a result of the acquisition of Elite First Aid, Inc., inventory increased approximately 0.5 million during the nine-month period. Inventory turnover, calculated using a twelve-month average inventory balance, was 2.1 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Receivables increased approximately 5.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023.

Long-term debt consists of (i) borrowings under the Company s revolving loan agreement with HSBC Bank, N.A. and (ii) amounts outstanding under the fixed rate mortgage on the Company s manufacturing and distribution facilities in Rocky Mount, NC and Vancouver, WA. The revolving loan agreement provides for borrowings of up to 65 million, at an interest rate of SOFR plus 1.75 ; interest is payable monthly. The loan agreement has an expiration date of May 31, 2026. The Company must pay a facility fee, payable quarterly, in an amount equal to one eighth of one percent (.125 per annum of the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit line. The facility is intended to provide liquidity for growth, share repurchases, dividends, acquisitions, and other business activities. Under the revolving loan agreement, the Company is required to maintain specific amounts of funded debt to EBITDA, a fixed charge coverage ratio and must have annual net income greater than 0, measured as of the end of each fiscal year. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the revolving loan agreement as then in effect. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, total debt outstanding under the Company s revolving credit facility increased by approximately 8.9 million, compared to total debt thereunder at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, 22,059,000 was outstanding and 42,941,000 was available for borrowing under the Company s credit facility. 
 The Company s manufacturing and distribution facilities in Rocky Mount, NC and Vancouver, WA were financed by a fixed rate mortgage with HSBC Bank, N.A. at a rate of 3.8 . The Company entered into the agreement on December 1, 2021. Payments of principal and interest are due monthly, with all amounts outstanding due on maturity on December 1, 2031. At September 30, 2024, there was approximately 10.5 million outstanding on the mortgage. 
 
 On May 23, 2024, the Company acquired the assets of Elite First Aid, Inc ("Elite First Aid") for approximately 7.1 million, . Based in Wake Forest, NC, Elite First Aid is a leading supplier of tactical, trauma and emergency medical products. 
 
 The Company believes that cash generated from operating activities, together with funds available under its revolving loan agreement, will, under current conditions, be sufficient to finance the Company s operations over the next twelve months from the filing of this report.

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosure about Market Risk 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 4: Controls and Procedures 
 (a) 	 Evaluation of Internal Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 as a result of an identified material weakness. As described in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company s information technology general controls (ITGCs) related to change management and logical controls were ineffective. The Company implemented changes to its Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting, as described in Item 4(b) below. Except as described below, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 (b) 	 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 In response to the material weakness identified above, the Company has implemented changes to its internal control over financial reporting, including: 
 
 The Company has implemented database change management and auditing software; 
 
 The Company has designed and implemented associated management review procedures. 

Management believes that, as a result of these changes, the material weakness, as described above, will be remediated. However, due to the nature of the material weakness, it will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed as of December 31, 2024.
