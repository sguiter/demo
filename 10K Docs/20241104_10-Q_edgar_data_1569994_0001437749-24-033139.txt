The Company reviews the investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to monitor securities in unrealized loss positions, which were comprised of individual securities, to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. In making this evaluation, management considers the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , allowance for credit losses on securities was recognized. The Company does not consider its securities with unrealized losses to be attributable to credit-related factors, as the unrealized losses in each category have occurred as a result of changes in noncredit-related factors such as changes in interest rates, market spreads and market conditions subsequent to purchase, not credit deterioration. Furthermore, the Company does not have the intent to sell any of these securities and believes that it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , there were sales of securities.

The Company provides several types of loans to its customers, including residential, construction, commercial and consumer loans. Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to one borrower or to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. While the Company's credit risks are geographically concentrated in the Milwaukee metropolitan area, there are no concentrations with individual or groups of related borrowers. While the real estate collateralizing these loans is primarily residential in nature, it ranges from owner-occupied single family homes to large apartment complexes. 
 
 Qualifying loans receivable totaling billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, were pledged as collateral against million and million in outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago ("FHLB") advances under a blanket security agreement at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Certain of the Company's executive officers, directors, employees, and their related interests have loans with the Bank. These loans to related parties are summarized below:

The Company utilized the Vintage Loss Rate method in determining expected future credit losses. This technique considers losses over the full life cycle of loan pools. A vintage is a group of loans originated in the same annual time period. The loss rate method measures the amount of loan charge offs, net of recoveries, loan losses recognized over the life of a pool by loan segment and vintage and compares those loan losses to the original loan balance of that pool as of a similar vintage. 
 
 To estimate a CECL loss rate for the pool, management first identifies the loan losses recognized between the pool date and the reporting date for the pool and determines which loan losses were related to loans outstanding at the pool date. The loss rate method then divides the loan losses recognized on loans outstanding as of the pool date by the outstanding loan balance as of the pool date. 
 
 The Company s expected loss estimate is anchored in historical credit loss experience, with an emphasis on all available portfolio data. The Company's historical look back period includes January 2012 through the current period, on an annual basis. When historical credit loss experience is not sufficient for a specific portfolio, the Company may supplement its own portfolio data with external models or data. 
 
 Additionally, the weighted average remaining maturity ("WARM") method is used for the Construction and Consumer loan pools. The WARM method considers an estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining life of the financial assets and uses average annual charge-off rates to estimate the allowance for credit losses. For amortizing assets, the remaining contractual life is adjusted by the expected scheduled payments and prepayments. The average annual charge-off rate is applied to the amortization-adjusted remaining life to determine the unadjusted lifetime historical charge-off rate. 
 
 Qualitative reserves reflect management s overall estimate of the extent to which current expected credit losses on collectively evaluated loans will differ from historical loss experience. The analysis takes into consideration other analytics performed within the organization, such as enterprise and concentration management. Management attempts to quantify qualitative reserves whenever possible. The CECL methodology applied focuses on evaluation of qualitative and environmental factors, including but not limited to: (i) evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans; (ii) management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio; (iii) consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience on each portfolio segment; (iv) trends in past due and nonperforming loans; (v) the risk characteristics of the various loan segments; (vi) changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio; (vii) concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries; (viii) existing economic conditions; (ix) the fair value of underlying collateral; and x other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect expected credit losses. 

The Company s CECL estimate applies a forecast that incorporates macroeconomic trends and other environmental factors. Management utilized national, regional and local leading economic indexes, as well as management judgment, as the basis for the forecast period. The historical loss rate was utilized as the base rate, and qualitative adjustments were utilized to reflect the forecast and other relevant factors. 
 
 The Company segments the loan portfolio into pools based on the following risk characteristics: collateral type, credit characteristics, loan origination balance, and outstanding loan balances. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses-Unfunded Commitments : 
 In addition to the ACL-Loans, the Company has established an ACL-Unfunded commitments, classified in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. This reserve is maintained at a level that management believes is sufficient to absorb losses arising from unfunded loan commitments, and is determined quarterly based on methodology similar to the methodology for determining the ACL-Loans. The allowance for unfunded commitments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was and million. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses : 
 The provision for credit losses is determined by the Company as the amount to be added to the ACL loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans, investment securities, and off-balance sheet credit exposures after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the ACL to a level that, in management's judgment, is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments. See Note 2 - Securities Available for Sale for additional information regarding the ACL related to investment securities. The following table presents the components of the provision for credit losses. 
 Unfunded commitments 
 Investment securities 
 Total 

Collateral Dependent Loans : 
 A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management's assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. For collateral dependent loans, expected credit losses are based on the estimated fair value of the collateral at the balance sheet date, with consideration for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. The following tables present collateral dependent loans by portfolio segment and collateral type, including those loans with and without a related allowance allocation. 

The following tables present collateral dependent loans by portfolio segment as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 :

The Company's procedures dictate that an updated valuation must be obtained with respect to underlying collateral at the time a loan is deemed impaired. Updated valuations may also be obtained upon transfer from loans receivable to real estate owned based upon the age of the prior appraisal, changes in market conditions or known changes to the physical condition of the property. 
 
 Estimated fair values are reduced to account for sales commissions, broker fees, unpaid property taxes and additional selling expenses to arrive at an estimated net realizable value. The adjustment factor is based upon the Company's actual experience with respect to sales of real estate owned over the prior two years. In situations in which the Company is placing reliance on an appraisal that is more than one year old, an additional adjustment factor is applied to account for downward market pressure since the date of appraisal. The additional adjustment factor is based upon relevant sales data available for the Company's general operating market as well as company-specific historical net realizable values as compared to the most recent appraisal prior to disposition. 
 
 With respect to multi-family income-producing real estate, appraisals are reviewed and estimated collateral values are adjusted by updating significant appraisal assumptions to reflect current real estate market conditions. Significant assumptions reviewed and updated include the capitalization rate, rental income and operating expenses. These adjusted assumptions are based upon recent appraisals received on similar properties as well as on actual experience related to real estate owned and currently under Company management. 

Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company establishes a risk rating at origination for all commercial loan and commercial real estate relationships. For relationships over 1 million, management monitors the loans on an ongoing basis for any changes in the borrower s ability to service their debt. Management also affirms the risk ratings for the loans in their respective portfolios on an annual basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 
 Watch. Loans classified as watch have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. Watch assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 
 
 Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and, additionally, the weakness or weaknesses to make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable or improbable. Substandard loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 
 Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans.

The short-term repurchase agreement represents the outstanding portion of a total million commitment with one unrelated banks as of September 30, 2024 . The short-term repurchase agreement is utilized by Waterstone Mortgage Corporation to finance loans originated for sale. This agreement is secured by the underlying loans being financed. Related interest rates are based upon the note rate associated with the loans being financed. The short-term repurchase agreement had a balance at September 30, 2024 and a million balance at December 31, 2023 . 
 
 The Company enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities. In addition, the Company enters into agreements under which it sells loans held for sale subject to an obligation to repurchase the same loans. Under these arrangements, the Company may transfer legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Company to repurchase the assets. As a result, these repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements (i.e., secured borrowings) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of assets. The obligation to repurchase the assets is reflected as a liability in the Company's consolidated statements of financial condition, while the securities and loans held for sale underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities and loans held for sale asset accounts. In other words, there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities or loans held for sale assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities. The Company's repurchase agreement is subject to master netting agreements, which sets forth the rights and obligations for repurchase and offset. Under the master netting agreement, the Company is entitled to set off the collateral placed with a single counterparty against obligations owed to that counterparty. 
 
 The Federal Reserve Bank FRB created a new borrowing facility called the Bank Term Funding Program. This program allows a bank to borrow against its investment portfolio, at par value, with no reduction for unrealized losses. The term is for one year and interest rate is fixed at the time the advance is taken and there is no prepayment penalty. Allowable investments for pledge are those the FRB can own. This would include all of the Company s investment securities except municipal securities, private label bonds, and corporate bonds. At September 30, 2024 , the Company had fully utilized its borrowing capacity under this program. The program does not allow for additional funding capacity after March 11, 2024. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , the Company had approximately million in unused borrowing capacity at the FHLB. 

The Company selects loans that meet underwriting criteria established by the FHLB as collateral for outstanding advances. The Company s borrowings from the FHLB are limited to of the carrying value of unencumbered one - to four -family mortgage loans, of the carrying value of multi-family loans and of the carrying value of home equity loans. In addition, these advances were collateralized by FHLB stock of million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023 , respectively. In the event of prepayment, the Company is obligated to pay all remaining contractual interest on the advance.

 2 Unused portions of home equity loans are available to the borrower for up to 10 years. 
 
 3 Unused portions of construction loans are available to the borrower for up to one year. 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counter-party. Collateral obtained generally consists of mortgages on the underlying real estate. 
 
 Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company holds mortgages on the underlying real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. 
 
 The Company has determined that there are probable losses related to commitments to extend credit or the standby letters of credit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . Please see Note 3 - Loans Receivable for discussion on the allowance for credit losses - unfunded commitments. 
 
 Residential mortgage loans sold to others are predominantly conventional residential first lien mortgages. The Company s agreements to sell residential mortgage loans in the normal course of business usually require certain representations and warranties on the underlying loans sold related to credit information, loan documentation and collateral, which if subsequently are untrue or breached, could require the Company to repurchase certain loans affected. The Company has only been required to make insignificant repurchases as a result of breaches of these representations and warranties. The Company s agreements to sell residential mortgage loans also contain limited recourse provisions. The recourse provisions are limited in that the recourse provision ends after certain payment criteria have been met. With respect to these loans, repurchase could be required if defined delinquency issues arose during the limited recourse period. Given that the underlying loans delivered to buyers are predominantly conventional first lien mortgages, historical experience has resulted in insignificant losses and repurchase activity. The Company's reserve for losses related to these recourse provisions totaled million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023 . 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Company, or its subsidiaries, are involved in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of management, any liability resulting from pending proceedings would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

The following tables presents the outstanding notional balances and fair values of outstanding derivative instruments:

Other assets Other liabilities 
 Interest rate locks Other assets Other liabilities

In determining the fair value of its derivative loan commitments, the Company considers the value that would be generated by the loan arising from exercise of the loan commitment when sold in the secondary mortgage market. That value includes the price that the loan is expected to be sold for in the secondary mortgage market. The fair value of these commitments is recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition with the changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking income. 
 
 The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company's mortgage banking derivatives, including interest rate lock commitments, is the loan pull through rate. This represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which the Company estimates will ultimately close. Generally, the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment will be positively (negatively) impacted when the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the interest rate lock commitment. Generally, an increase in the pull through rate will result in the fair value of the interest rate lock increasing when in a gain position, or decreasing when in a loss position. The pull through rate is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. The pull through rate is computed using historical data and the ratio is periodically reviewed by the Company. 
 
 Interest Rate Swaps 
 
 The back-to-back swaps mature in December 2029 to June 2037. Commercial borrower swaps are completed independently with each borrower and are not subject to master netting arrangements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , no back-to-back swaps were in default. The Company pays fixed rates and receives floating rates based upon LIBOR on the swaps with dealer counterparties. Dealer counterparty swaps are subject to master netting agreements among the contracts within our Bank. No right of offset existed with dealer counterparty swaps as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . All changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in other non-interest income. The Company pledged cash at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023 .

The following summarizes the valuation techniques for assets recorded in the consolidated statements of financial condition at their fair value on a recurring basis: 
 
 Available-for-sale securities The Company s investment securities classified as available for sale include: mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, government sponsored enterprise bonds, municipal securities and other debt securities. The fair value of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and government sponsored enterprise bonds are determined by a third party valuation source using observable market data utilizing a matrix or multi-dimensional relational pricing model. Standard inputs to these models include observable market data such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, prepayment models and bid/offer market data. For securities with an early redemption feature, an option adjusted spread model is utilized to adjust the issuer spread. These model and matrix measurements are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of municipal and other debt securities is determined by a third party valuation source using observable market data utilizing a multi-dimensional relational pricing model. Standard inputs to this model include observable market data such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker quotes, rating updates and issuer spreads. These model measurements are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The change in fair value is recorded through an adjustment to the statement of comprehensive income. 

Loans held for sale The Company carries loans held for sale at fair value under the fair value option model. Fair value is generally determined by estimating a gross premium or discount, which is derived from pricing currently observable in the secondary market, principally from observable prices for forward sale commitments. Loans held-for-sale are considered to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques. The change in fair value is recorded through an adjustment to the statement of income. 
 
 Mortgage banking derivatives - Mortgage banking derivatives include interest rate lock commitments to originate residential loans held for sale to individual customers and forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans to various investors. The Company utilizes a valuation model to estimate the fair value of its interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, which includes applying a pull through rate based upon historical experience and the current interest rate environment and then multiplying by quoted investor prices. The Company also utilizes a valuation model to estimate the fair value of its forward commitments to sell residential loans, which includes matching specific terms and maturities of the forward commitments against applicable investor pricing available. While there are Level 2 and 3 inputs used in the valuation models, the Company has determined that one or more of the inputs significant in the valuation of both of the mortgage banking derivatives fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The change in fair value is recorded through an adjustment to the statement of income. 
 
 Interest rate swap assets/liabilities - The Company offers loan level swaps to its customers and offsets its exposure from such contracts by entering into mirror image swaps with a financial institution / swap counterparty. The fair values of derivatives are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date. Our derivatives are traded in an over-the-counter market where quoted market prices are not always available. Therefore, the fair values of derivatives are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs. The inputs will vary based on the type of derivative, but could include interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, prepayment rates, and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third -party pricing services. Interest rate swap assets and liabilities are considered to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques. The change in fair value is recorded through an adjustment to the statement of operations, within other income and other expense. 
 
 The table below presents reconciliation for all assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 during 2024 and 2023 .

 Assets Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis 
 
 The following tables present information about assets recorded in the consolidated statements of financial condition at their fair value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. 

Impaired mortgage servicing rights 

Impaired mortgage servicing rights 

Real estate owned On a non-recurring basis, real estate owned is recorded in the consolidated statements of financial condition at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is determined based on third party appraisals and, if less than the carrying value of the foreclosed loan, the carrying value of the real estate owned is adjusted to the fair value. Appraised values are adjusted to consider disposition costs and also to take into consideration the age of the most recent appraisal. Given the significance of the adjustments made to appraised values necessary to estimate the fair value of the properties, real estate owned is considered to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques. 
 
 Mortgage servicing rights The Company utilizes an independent valuation from a third party which uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of mortgage servicing rights. The model utilizes prepayment assumptions to project cash flows related to the mortgage servicing rights based upon the current interest rate environment, which is then discounted to estimate an expected fair value of the mortgage servicing rights. The model considers characteristics specific to the underlying mortgage portfolio, such as: contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges and costs to service. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs utilized in the estimation process, mortgage servicing rights are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company records the mortgage servicing rights at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. 
 
 For Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements were as follows: 
 
 Pricing models Pull through rate

A description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. 
 
 Fair value information about financial instruments follows, whether or not recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. 

The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments consist of the following:

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in determining its fair value disclosures for financial instruments. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 The carrying amount reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition for cash and cash equivalents is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
 
 Loans Receivable 
 
 The fair value estimation process for the loan portfolio uses an exit price concept and reflects discounts the Company believes are consistent with discounts in the marketplace. Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as one - to four -family, multi-family, home equity, construction and land, commercial real estate, commercial, and other consumer. The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for similar maturities. The fair value analysis also includes other assumptions to estimate fair value, intended to approximate those a market participant would use in an orderly transaction, with adjustments for discount rates, interest rates, liquidity, and credit spreads, as appropriate. 
 
 FHLB Stock 
 
 For FHLB stock, the carrying amount is the amount at which shares can be redeemed with the FHLB and is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
 
 Deposits and Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes 
 
 The fair values for interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). The fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates of similar remaining maturities to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities of the outstanding certificates of deposit. The advance payments by borrowers for taxes are equal to their carrying amounts at the reporting date. 
 
 Borrowings 
 
 Fair values for borrowings are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current interest rates to estimated future cash flows of the borrowings. 
 
 Accrued Interest Payable and Accrued Interest Receivable 
 
 For accrued interest payable and accrued interest receivable, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
 
 Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit 
 
 Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are generally not marketable. Furthermore, interest rates on any amounts drawn under such commitments would be generally established at market rates at the time of the draw. Fair values for the Company s commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements, the counterparty s credit standing, and discounted cash flow analyses. The fair value of the Company s commitments to extend credit was not material at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. 
 
 The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 

general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market area, including employment prospects, that are different than expected; 

competition among depository and other financial institutions; 

inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, our mortgage banking revenues, the fair value of financial instruments or the origination levels in our lending business, or increase the level of defaults, losses or prepayments on loans we have made and make whether held in portfolio or sold in the secondary markets; 

adverse changes in the securities or secondary mortgage markets; 

changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees and capital requirements;

See also the factors referred to in reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (particularly those under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and as may be described from time to time in the Corporation s subsequent SEC filings). 
 
 The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. 
 
 Overview 
 
 The following discussion and analysis is presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the Company s financial condition and results of operations. It is intended to complement the unaudited consolidated financial statements, footnotes, and supplemental financial data appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction therewith. The detailed discussion in the sections below focuses on the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the financial condition as of September 30, 2024 compared to the financial condition as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 As described in the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, we have two reportable segments: community banking and mortgage banking. The community banking segment provides consumer and business banking products and services to customers primarily within Southeastern Wisconsin. Consumer products include loan products, deposit products, and personal investment services. Business banking products include loans for working capital, inventory and general corporate use, commercial real estate construction loans, and deposit accounts. The mortgage banking segment, which is conducted by offices in 26 states through Waterstone Mortgage Corporation, consists of originating residential mortgage loans primarily for sale in the secondary market. 
 
 Our community banking segment generates the significant majority of our consolidated net interest income and requires the significant majority of our provision for loan losses. Our mortgage banking segment generates the significant majority of our noninterest income and a majority of our noninterest expenses. We have provided below a discussion of the material results of operations for each segment on a separate basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which focuses on noninterest income and noninterest expenses. We have also provided a discussion of the consolidated operations of the Company, which includes the consolidated operations of the Bank and Waterstone Mortgage Corporation, for the same periods. 
 
 Significant Items 
 
 There were no significant items that impacted earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Comparison of Community Banking Segment Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Net income totaled 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income decreased 181,000 to 12.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposits and borrowings increased 3.4 million as replacement rates increased in the rising interest rate environment. Offsetting the increase in interest expense on deposit and borrowings, interest income on loans increased 3.2 million as replacement rates and average loans held for investment balances were higher than in the prior year and interest income on debt securities, federal funds sold and short-term investments increased due to the increase in the average balance and replacement rates. 
 
 There was a negative provision for credit losses of 302,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of 445,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The negative provision for credit losses of 302,000 consisted of a 218,000 negative provision related to loans and 84,000 negative provision related to unfunded commitments for the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the current quarter decrease was primarily due to a decrease in historical loss rates, net recoveries for the period, and improvements in certain internal asset quality metrics offset by an adjustment in the qualitative factors primarily related to increases in economic risks related to commercial real estate loans during the quarter. The negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments was 84,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments of 239,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to a decrease of loans that are currently waiting to be funded compared to the prior quarter end. We made adjustments to our qualitative factors, primarily to account for the changes in internal metrics and external risk factors. The forecast factor remained unchanged as we monitor the economic environment going forward. 

38

Table of Contents 

Compensation, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits expense increased 708,000 to 5.3 million compared to the quarter ending September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in health insurance expense as claims increased. Other noninterest expense decreased 101,000 to 602,000 as certain loan fees paid to the mortgage banking segment for the purchase of single-family adjustable rate mortgage loans decreased. These fees are eliminated in the consolidated statements of income. 
 
 Comparison of Mortgage Banking Segment Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Net loss totaled 50,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net loss of 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We originated 558.7 million in mortgage loans held for sale (including sales to the community banking segment) during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which represents a decrease of 38.8 million, or 6.5 , from the 597.6 million originated during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in loan production volume was driven by a 73.4 million, or 12.9 , decrease in purchase products and was offset by a 34.5 million increase in refinance products. Total mortgage banking noninterest income decreased 66,000, or 0.3 , to 21.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in mortgage banking noninterest income was related to a 6.5 decrease in volume offset by a 5.9 increase in gross margin on loans originated and sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. Gross margin on loans originated and sold is the ratio of mortgage banking income (excluding the change in interest rate lock fair value) divided by total loan originations. The gross margin on loans originated and sold contraction reflects decreased industry demand due to the increased competition from mortgage originators. We sell loans on both a servicing-released and a servicing-retained basis. Waterstone Mortgage Corporation has contracted with a third party to service the loans for which we retain servicing. 
 
 Additionally, our overall margin can be affected by the mix of both loan type (conventional loans versus governmental) and loan purpose (purchase versus refinance). Conventional loans include loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards, whereas governmental loans are those loans guaranteed by the federal government, such as a Federal Housing Authority or U.S. Department of Agriculture loan. Loans originated for the purchase of a residential property comprised 88.9 of total originations during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 95.4 of total originations during the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The mix of loan type trended towards more conventional loans and less governmental loans, with governmental loans and conventional loans comprising 35.2 and 64.8 of all loan originations, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 39.2 and 60.8 of all loan originations, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Total compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits decreased 1.3 million, or 7.3 , to 15.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily related to decreased salary expense and incentives expense driven by reduced employee headcount and a decrease in new branches added over the past year.

Table of Contents 

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 
 The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

______________ 

(1) 
 Interest income includes net deferred loan fee amortization income of 168,000 and 179,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

(2) 
 Non-accrual loans have been included in average loans receivable balance. 

(3) 
 Includes available for sale securities. Average balance of available for sale securities is based on amortized historical cost. 

(4) 
 Interest income from tax exempt securities is computed on a taxable equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 

Net interest income decreased 472,000, or 3.9 , to 11.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the increased cost of funds as a result of the rising interest rate environment. 

Interest income on loans increased 2.8 million, or 11.6 , to 26.6 million due primarily to a 39 basis point increase in average yield on loans as interest rates continued to increase over the past year and an increase in average loan balance as loans held for investment increased. The increase in average loan balance was driven by an increase of a 60.9 million, or 3.7 , in the average balance of loans held for investment and an increase of 12.5 million, or 7.3 , in average loans held for sale. 

Interest expense on time deposits increased 2.7 million, or 44.1 , to 9.0 million primarily due to a 111 basis point increase in average cost of time deposits. Additionally, the average balance of time deposits increased 66.5 million compared to the prior year period. 

Interest expense on money market, savings, and escrow accounts increased 293,000, or 24.6 , to 1.5 million due primarily to a 40 basis point increase in average cost of money market, savings, and escrow accounts as rates increased to stay competitive in the market. Partially offsetting the increase in average cost, the average balance decreased 2.7 million. 

Interest expense on borrowings increased 251,000, or 3.6 , to 7.2 million due to a six basis point increase in the cost of borrowings during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as we transitioned to more short-term fundings. Additionally, the average balance increased 15.8 million to 600.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 584.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 There was a negative provision for credit losses of 377,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 445,000 provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 377,000 negative provision for credit losses consisted of a 293,000 negative provision related to loans and a negative provision related to unfunded commitments of 84,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease related to loans was primarily due to a recovery, a decrease in historical losses used in the calculation, and an improvement in certain asset quality metrics. The decrease in provision related to unfunded commitments was primarily due to an decrease in the construction loans yet to be funded. We made adjustments to our qualitative factors, primarily to account for the changes in internal metrics and external risk factors. The forecast factor remained unchanged as we monitor the economic environment going forward. 
 
 The provision is primarily a function of the Company's reserving methodology and assessments of certain quantitative and qualitative factors which are used to determine an appropriate allowance for credit losses for the period. See further discussion regarding the allowance for loan losses in the "Asset Quality" section for an analysis of charge-offs, nonperforming assets, specific reserves and additional provisions and the "Allowance for Credit Loss" section.

The increase in mortgage banking income was primarily the result of a increase in gross margin on loans originated and sold offset by a decrease in loan origination volumes. Gross margin on loans originated and sold is the ratio of mortgage banking income (excluding the change in interest rate lock fair value) divided by total loan originations. Gross margin on loans originated and sold increased 5.9 at the mortgage banking segment. See "Comparison of Mortgage Banking Segment Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023" above for additional discussion of the increase in mortgage banking income.

Total noninterest expenses decreased 1.5 million, or 4.9 , to 28.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 30.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits expense at our mortgage banking segment decreased 1.3 million, or 7.3 , to 15.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease primarily related to decreased salary expense and incentives expense driven by reduced employee headcount and a decrease in new branches added over the past year 

Compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits expense at the community banking segment increased 708,000, or 15.3 , to 5.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in health insurance expense as claims increased. 

Occupancy, office furniture and equipment expense at the mortgage banking segment decreased 188,000 to 953,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily resulting from decreased rent and depreciation expenses as underperforming branches were closed over the past year. 

Occupancy, office furniture and equipment expense at the community banking segment increased 52,000 to 904,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due primarily to increases related to new equipment expenses. 

Professional fees decreased 176,000 to 569,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease related to a decrease in legal fees at the mortgage banking segment related to a complaint. In July 2022, a complaint was filed by Mutual of Omaha Mortgage, Inc. asserting claims against Waterstone Mortgage Corporation relating to certain employees hired by Waterstone Mortgage Corporation who previously worked for Mutual. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend its interests in this matter and pursue all possible defenses against the claims. Given the current stage of the litigation, the Company is not yet able to make a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in this matter, nor is it able to estimate the range of any possible loss. 

Other noninterest expense decreased 619,000, or 24.0 , to 2.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease primarily related to decreased provision for branch losses and provision for loan sale losses at the mortgage banking segment. 

Income Taxes 
 
 Income tax expense totaled 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 500,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense was recognized on the statement of income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 at an effective rate of 19.7 of pretax income and during the three months ended September 30, 2023 at an effective rate of 13.3 of pretax income. The increase in the effective rate related to a decrease in pre-tax income during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Comparison of Community Banking Segment Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Net income totaled 11.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income decreased 4.6 million to 35.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 39.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposits and borrowings increased 17.2 million as replacement rates increased in the rising interest rate environment. Offsetting the increase in interest expense on deposit and borrowings, interest income on loans increased 11.8 million as replacement rates and average loans held for investment balances were higher than in the prior year. 
 
 There was a negative provision for credit losses of 476,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of 991,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The negative provision for credit losses of 476,000 consisted of a 380,000 negative provision related to loans and 96,000 negative provision related to unfunded commitments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease related to loans was primarily due to decreases in historical loss rates and loan originations. The decrease in provision related to unfunded commitments was primarily due to an decrease in the loans that are currently waiting to be funded compared to the prior quarter end. We made adjustments to our qualitative factors, primarily to account for the changes in internal metrics and external risk factors. The forecast factor remained unchanged as we monitor the economic environment going forward. 
 
 Compensation, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits expense increased 1.3 million to 15.8 million compared to the quarter ending September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in health insurance expense as claims increased. Other noninterest expense decreased 1.3 million to 2.0 million as certain loan fees paid to the mortgage banking segment for the purchase of single-family adjustable rate mortgage loans decreased. These fees are eliminated in the consolidated statements of income. 
 
 Comparison of Mortgage Banking Segment Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Net income totaled 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net loss of 5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We originated 1.68 billion in mortgage loans held for sale (including sales to the community banking segment) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represents an increase of 14.3 million, or 0.9 , from the 1.66 billion originated during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in loan production volume was driven by a 75.2 million increase in refinance products as mortgage rates decreased to start the year offset by a 62.5 million , or 3.9 , decrease in purchase products. Total mortgage banking noninterest income increased 4.4 million, or 7.0 , to 66.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 62.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in mortgage banking noninterest income was related to a 0.9 increase in volume and by a 6.6 increase in gross margin on loans originated and sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. Gross margin on loans originated and sold is the ratio of mortgage banking income (excluding the change in interest rate lock fair value) divided by total loan originations. The gross margin on loans originated and sold contraction reflects decreased industry demand due to the increased competition from mortgage originators. We sell loans on both a servicing-released and a servicing-retained basis. Waterstone Mortgage Corporation has contracted with a third party to service the loans for which we retain servicing. 
 
 Additionally, our overall margin can be affected by the mix of both loan type (conventional loans versus governmental) and loan purpose (purchase versus refinance). Conventional loans include loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards, whereas governmental loans are those loans guaranteed by the federal government, such as a Federal Housing Authority or U.S. Department of Agriculture loan. Loans originated for the purchase of a residential property comprised 90.9 of total originations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 96.1 of total originations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The mix of loan type trended towards more conventional loans and less governmental loans, with governmental loans and conventional loans comprising 36.3 and 63.7 of all loan originations, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 37.9 and 62.1 of all loan originations, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The decrease in other noninterest income was due primarily to a decrease in gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold mortgage servicing rights related to 233.1 million in loans serviced for third parties. The sale generated 2.1 million in net proceeds on a mortgage servicing rights book value of 2.0 million and resulted in a 152,000 gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold mortgage servicing rights related to 318.4 million in loans serviced for third parties. The sale generated 3.5 million in net proceeds and a 583,000 gain. 
 
 Total compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits decreased 2.6 million, or 5.3 , to 47.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 50.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in compensation expense was primarily related to decreased salaries driven by a reduction in headcount, sign on incentives, and health insurance expense offset by loan production commissions and branch manager pay.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 
 The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

_____________ 

(1) 
 Interest income includes net deferred loan fee amortization income of 486,000 and 474,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

(2) 
 Non-accrual loans have been included in average loans receivable balance. 

(3) 
 Includes available for sale securities. Average balance of available for sale securities is based on amortized historical cost. 

(4) 
 Interest income from tax exempt securities is computed on a taxable equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 

Net interest income decreased 5.1 million, or 13.3 , to 33.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 38.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the increased cost of funds as a result of the rising interest rate environment. 

Interest income on loans increased 10.8 million, or 16.4 , to 76.7 million due primarily to a 48 basis point increase in average yield on loans as interest rates continued to increase over the past year and an increase in average loan balance as loans held for investment increased. The increase in average loan balance was driven by an increase of a 91.5 million, or 5.8 , in the average balance of loans held for investment and an increase of 16.1 million, or 10.3 , in average loans held for sale. 

Interest expense on time deposits increased 10.8 million, or 76.5 , to 25.0 million primarily due to a 163 basis point increase in average cost of time deposits. Additionally, the average balance of time deposits increased 73.3 million compared to the prior year period. 

Interest expense on money market, savings, and escrow accounts increased 836,000, or 25.5 to 4.1 million due primarily to a 47 basis point increase in average cost of money market, savings, and escrow accounts as rates increased to stay competitive in the market. Partially offsetting the increase in average cost, the average balance decreased 18.5 million. 

Interest expense on borrowings increased 5.1 million, or 30.5 , to 21.6 million due to a 53 basis point increase in the cost of borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as we transitioned to more short-term fundings. Additionally, the average balance increased 82.1 million to 608.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 526.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 There was a negative provision for credit losses of 535,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 1.1 million provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 535,000 negative provision for credit losses consisted of a 439,000 negative provision related to loans and a negative provision related to unfunded commitments of 96,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease related to loans was primarily due to a decrease in originations and historical losses used in the calculation and the decrease in provision related to unfunded commitments was primarily due to a decrease in the loans yet to be funded. We made adjustments to our qualitative factors, primarily to account for the changes in internal metrics and external risk factors. The forecast factor remained unchanged as we monitor the economic environment going forward. 
 
 The provision is primarily a function of the Company's reserving methodology and assessments of certain quantitative and qualitative factors which are used to determine an appropriate allowance for credit losses for the period. See further discussion regarding the allowance for loan losses in the "Asset Quality" section for an analysis of charge-offs, nonperforming assets, specific reserves and additional provisions and the "Allowance for Credit Loss" section.

Total noninterest income increased 6.0 million, or 9.3 to 70.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 64.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from increase in mortgage banking noninterest income offset by a decrease in other income. 

The increase in mortgage banking income was primarily the result of a increase in loan origination volume and gross margin on loans originated and sold. Gross margin on loans originated and sold is the ratio of mortgage banking income (excluding the change in interest rate lock fair value) divided by total loan originations. Total loan origination volume on a consolidated basis increased 86.5 million, or 5.5 , to 1.66 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.58 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin on loans originated and sold increased 6.6 at the mortgage banking segment. See "Comparison of Mortgage Banking Segment Results of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023" above for additional discussion of the increase in mortgage banking income. 

The decrease in other noninterest income was due primarily to a decrease in gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold mortgage servicing rights related to 233.1 million in loans serviced for third parties. The sale generated 2.1 million in net proceeds on a mortgage servicing rights book value of 2.0 million and resulted in a 152,000 gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold mortgage servicing rights related to 318.4 million in loans serviced for third parties. The sale generated 3.5 million in net proceeds and a 583,000 gain. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company maintained servicing rights related to 67.0 million and 220.0 million, respectively, in loans previously sold to third parties.

Compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits expense at our mortgage banking segment decreased 2.6 million, or 5.3 , to 47.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in compensation expense was primarily related to decreased salaries driven by a reduction in headcount, sign on incentives, and health insurance expense offset by branch manager pay and loan production commissions. 

Compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits expense at the community banking segment increased 1.3 million, or 9.2 , to 15.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in health insurance expense as claims increased. 

Occupancy, office furniture and equipment expense at the mortgage banking segment decreased 439,000 to 3.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily resulting from decreased rent and depreciation expenses as underperforming branches were closed over the past year. 

Occupancy, office furniture and equipment expense at the community banking segment increased 131,000 to 2.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due primarily to increases in new equipment and repairs and maintenance expenses. 

Advertising expense increased 78,000, or 2.8 , to 2.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to advertising expenses at the community banking segment due to the increased efforts to increase deposit accounts. 

Data processing expense increased 304,000, or 8.8 , to 3.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increases at the community banking and mortgage banking segments were due to additional investments in technology. 

Professional fees increased 291,000 to 2.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase related to an increase in legal fees at the mortgage banking segment. In July 2022, a complaint was filed by Mutual of Omaha Mortgage, Inc. asserting claims against Waterstone Mortgage Corporation relating to certain employees hired by Waterstone Mortgage Corporation who previously worked for Mutual. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend its interests in this matter and pursue all possible defenses against the claims. Given the current stage of the litigation, the Company is not yet able to make a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in this matter, nor is it able to estimate the range of any possible loss. 

Other noninterest expense decreased 2.6 million, or 31.0 , to 5.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease primarily related to decreased provision for branch losses, branch overhead, provision for loan sale losses, and reversal of mortgage servicing rights impairment at the mortgage banking segment. 

Income Taxes 
 
 Income tax expense totaled 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense was recognized on the statement of income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 at an effective rate of 24.3 of pretax income and during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 at an effective rate of 19.0 of pretax income. On March 18, 2024, the State of Wisconsin Department of Revenue issued an emergency ruling with additional details of the law. This publication enabled us to estimate the impact on our Wisconsin state income tax expense. The impact moving forward should result in no Wisconsin state income taxes being expensed, resulting in a lower estimated effective tax rate. The elimination of Wisconsin state income tax expense resulted in the establishment of a valuation allowance for Wisconsin state income deferred tax assets, resulting in a one-time 1.1 million charge to state income tax expense in the first quarter. Partially offsetting the impact of the charge related to the valuation allowance we realized a one-time benefit of approximately 368,000 during the year to recognize a reduction in current state income tax provision.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 
 Total Assets Total assets increased by 30.9 million, or 1.4 , to 2.24 billion at September 30, 2024 from 2.21 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets primarily reflects an increase in loans receivable and securities available for sale. The increase in total assets reflects liability increases in deposits and borrowings. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents increased 5.0 million, or 13.7 , to 41.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 36.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily reflects the increase of funding sources from borrowings, deposits, and advance payments by borrowers for taxes. 
 
 Securities Available for Sale Securities available for sale increased 8.3 million to 213.2 million at September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to the purchases of securities throughout the year exceeding paydowns and maturities and an increase in fair value as longer term interest rates decreased compared to the beginning of the year. 
 
 Loans Held for Sale - Loans held for sale decreased 9.1 million to 155.8 million at September 30, 2024 due to the decrease of purchase activity. 
 
 Loans Receivable - Loans receivable held for investment increased 31.2 million to 1.70 billion at September 30, 2024. The increase in total loans receivable was primarily attributable to increases in each of the multi-family, construction, and commercial real estate loan categories offset by a decrease in the one-to-four family loan category.

Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans - The allowance for credit losses decreased to 18.2 million at September 30, 2024. There was a 439,000 negative provision for credit losses - loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The negative provision for credit losses related to loans decreased primarily due to a decrease in historical losses used in the calculation and decreases in certain qualitative factors. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made adjustments to our qualitative factors, primarily to account for the changes in interest rates, internal metrics, and external risk factors. See Note 3 - Loans Receivable of the notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, net recoveries totaled 88,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Prepaid expenses and other assets Total prepaid expenses and other assets decreased 6.6 million to 45.8 million at September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in back-to-back loan swap fair value adjustment as long term interest rates decreased, mortgage servicing rights due to the sale, and deferred tax assets due to the WI state tax rate decrease. 
 
 Deposits Total deposits increased 73.2 million to 1.26 billion at September 30, 2024. The increase was driven by increases of 73.9 million in time deposits and 6.0 million in money market and savings deposits offset by a decrease of 6.7 million in demand deposits. 
 
 Borrowings Total borrowings decreased 50.9 million, or 8.3 , to 560.1 million at September 30, 2024. The community banking segment paid off 145.0 million in long-term FHLB borrowings, borrowed 150.0 million of new long-term FHLB borrowings, and paid off 54.7 million in new short-term FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank borrowings. External short-term borrowings at the mortgage banking segment decreased a total of 1.2 million at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023. 
 
 Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes - Advance payments by borrowers for taxes increased 21.2 million to 27.8 million at September 30, 2024. The increase was the result of payments received from borrowers for their real estate taxes and is seasonally normal, as balances increase during the course of the calendar year until real estate tax obligations are paid in the fourth quarter. 
 
 Other Liabilities - Other liabilities decreased 10.5 million to 50.5 million at September 30, 2024. Other liabilities decreased primarily due to a seasonal decrease in outstanding checks related to advance payments by borrowers for taxes. The Company receives payments from borrowers for their real estate taxes during the course of the calendar year until real estate tax obligations are paid in the fourth quarter. At the time at which the disbursements are made, the outstanding checks are classified as other liabilities in the statements of financial condition, and these amounts remain classified as other liabilities until settled. Additionally, the back-to-back loan swap fair value adjustment decreased as long term interest rates decreased. Offsetting the decreases, the interest rate expense payable to the Federal Reserve Bank increased as payments are due to time of principal payments. 
 
 Shareholders Equity Shareholders' equity decreased 2.1 million to 342.0 million at September 30, 2024. Shareholders' equity decreased primarily due to the declaration of dividends and the repurchase of stock. Partially offsetting the decreases, there were increases due to the net income, equity awards granted, unearned ESOP shares vesting, and an increase in the fair value of the securities portfolio.

All loans that are 90 days or more past due with respect to principal and interest are recognized as non-accrual. Troubled debt restructurings that are non-accrual, either due to being past due greater than 90 days or which have not yet performed under the modified terms for a reasonable period of time, are included in the table above. In addition, loans that are past due less than 90 days are evaluated to determine the likelihood of collectability given other credit risk factors such as early stage delinquency, the nature of the collateral or the results of a borrower review. When the collection of all contractual principal and interest is determined to be unlikely, the loan is moved to non-accrual status and an updated appraisal of the underlying collateral is ordered. This process generally takes place when a loan is contractually past due between 60 and 89 days. 
 
 A loan is considered collateral-dependent when the debtor is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale or operation of the collateral. For all classes of loans and leases deemed collateral-dependent, the Company elected the practical expedient to estimate expected credit losses based on the collateral s fair value less cost to sell. In most cases, the Company records a specific valuation allowance or a partial charge-off to reduce the loan s carrying value to the collateral s fair value less cost to sell. Substantially all of the collateral consists of various types of real estate including residential and commercial properties.

Total non-accrual loans increased by 560,000, or 11.6 , to 5.4 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 4.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans receivable was 0.32 at September 30, 2024 and 0.29 at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 2.1 million in loans were placed on non-accrual status. Offsetting this activity, 714,000 in loans returned to accrual status and 840,000 in principal payments were received during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Of the 5.4 million in total non-accrual loans as of September 30, 2024, 2.6 million in loans have been specifically reviewed to assess whether a specific valuation allowance is necessary. A specific valuation allowance is established for an amount equal to the impairment when the carrying value of the loan exceeds the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral with an adjustment made for costs to dispose of the asset. Based upon these specific reviews, no charge-offs have been recorded over the life of these loans and there were no specific reserves as of September 30, 2024. The remaining 2.8 million of non-accrual loans were reviewed on an aggregate basis as of September 30, 2024. . 
 The outstanding principal balance of our five largest non-accrual loans as of September 30, 2024 totaled 2.4 million, which represents 45.6 of total non-accrual loans as of that date. Two of the loans were reviewed on an aggregate basis along with the other loans held for investment at the mortgage segment. 
 
 Interest payments received are treated as interest income on a cash basis as long as the remaining book value of the loan (i.e., after charge-off of all identified losses) is deemed to be fully collectible. If the remaining book value is not deemed to be fully collectible, all payments received are applied to unpaid principal. Determination as to the ultimate collectability of the remaining book value is supported by an updated credit department evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects for repayment, including consideration of the borrower's sustained historical repayment performance and other relevant factors. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no loans 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest.

The allowance for credit losses - loans was 18.2 million at September 30, 2024 and 18.5 million at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a 439,000 negative provision for credit losses. Additionally, net recoveries totaled 88,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 We had net recoveries of 88,000, or 0.01 of average loans annualized, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of 33,000, or less than 0.01 of average loans annualized, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our underwriting policies and procedures emphasize that credit decisions must rely on both the credit quality of the borrower and the estimated value of the underlying collateral. Credit quality is assured only when the estimated value of the collateral is objectively determined and is not subject to significant fluctuation. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses - loans has been determined in accordance with GAAP. We are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. Any future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based upon our assessment of the overall loan portfolio and the underlying collateral, trends in non-performing loans, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. To the best of management s knowledge, all probable losses have been provided for in the allowance for credit losses - loans. 

54

Table of Contents 

The establishment of the amount of the allowance for credit loss inherently involves judgments by management as to the appropriateness of the allowance, which ultimately may or may not be correct. Higher than anticipated rates of loan default would likely result in a need to increase provisions in future years. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We maintain liquid assets at levels we consider adequate to meet our liquidity needs. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund loan commitments, repay our borrowings, fund deposit outflows and pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives. The level of our liquidity position at any point in time is dependent upon the judgment of the senior management as supported by the Asset/Liability Committee. Liquidity is monitored on a daily, weekly and monthly basis using a variety of measurement tools and indicators. 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, amortization and repayment of loans, sales of loans held for sale, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, and earnings and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan repayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competitors. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term, interest-earning assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. Additional sources of liquidity used for the purpose of managing long- and short-term cash flows include advances from the FHLB. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primary uses of cash and cash equivalents included: 1.66 billion in funding loans held for sale, 31.1 million to fund loans held for investment, 10.8 million for purchases of mortgage related securities, 12.2 million for purchases of debt securities, 2.3 million for FHLB stock, 145.0 million for payoffs of long-term borrowings, 55.9 million for payoffs of short-term borrowings, 8.5 million for cash dividends paid, and 12.1 million for purchases of our common stock. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primary sources of cash and cash equivalents included: 1.74 billion in proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale, 150.0 million in long-term borrowings, 16.7 million in principal repayments on mortgage related securities, 73.2 million for increase in deposits, 5.7 million in maturities of debt securities, 2.1 million in proceeds for mortgage servicing rights sale, and 13.4 million in net income. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primary uses of cash and cash equivalents included: 1.58 billion in funding loans held for sale, 140.9 million to fund loans held for investment, 18.9 million for purchases of mortgage related securities, 9.4 million for FHLB stock, 215.0 million for payoffs of long-term borrowings, 12.4 million for cash dividends paid, and 19.8 million for purchases of our common stock. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primary sources of cash and cash equivalents included: 1.60 billion in proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale, 174.0 million in long-term borrowings, 242.1 million in short-tern borrowings, 15.9 million in principal repayments on mortgage related securities, 6.2 million for increase in deposits, 3.6 million in maturities of debt securities, 3.5 million in proceeds for mortgage servicing rights sale, and 9.4 million in net income. 
 
 A portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents, which are a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, 41.4 million and 62.3 million of our assets were invested in cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were comprised of the following: 35.8 million in cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank and other depository institutions and 5.6 million in federal funds sold and short-term investments. Our primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans, proceeds from the calls and maturities of debt and mortgage-related securities, increases in deposit accounts, advances from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve, and repurchase agreements from other institutions. 
 
 Liquidity management is both a daily and longer-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the FHLB which provide an additional source of funds. At September 30, 2024, we had 160.0 million in long term advances from the FHLB with contractual maturity dates in 2027, 2029, and 2034. See Note 6 - Borrowings of the notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information about the remaining call option details of our FHLB long-term debt. 
 
 The Company had approximately 325.3 million of uninsured deposits for approximately 1,354 customers as of September 30, 2024. Uninsured deposit amounts are estimated based on the portions of customer account balances that exceed the FDIC insurance limits. 

55

Table of Contents 

At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans receivable of 28.1 million. In addition, at September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments under construction loans of 55.1 million, unfunded commitments under business lines of credit of 12.7 million and unfunded commitments under home equity lines of credit and standby letters of credit of 12.3 million. At September 30, 2024, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled 745.3 million. Based on prior experience, management believes that, subject to the Bank s funding needs, a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In the event a significant portion of our deposits is not retained by us, we will have to utilize other funding sources, such as FHLB advances, in order to maintain our level of assets. However, we cannot assure that such borrowings would be available on attractive terms, or at all, if and when needed. Alternatively, we could reduce our level of liquid assets, such as our cash and cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale in order to meet funding needs. In addition, the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher if market interest rates are higher or there is an increased amount of competition for deposits in our market area at the time of renewal. 
 
 Waterstone Financial, Inc. is a separate legal entity from WaterStone Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to pay dividends to its shareholders, repurchase shares of its common stock, and for other corporate purposes. The primary source of liquidity for Waterstone Financial, Inc. is dividend payments from WaterStone Bank. The ability of WaterStone Bank to pay dividends is subject to regulatory restrictions. At September 30, 2024, Waterstone Financial, Inc. (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets totaling 15.9 million. 
 
 Capital 
 
 Shareholders' equity decreased 2.1 million to 342.0 million at September 30, 2024. Shareholders' equity decreased primarily due to the declaration of dividends and the repurchase of stock. Partially offsetting the decreases, there were increases due to the net income, equity awards granted, unearned ESOP shares vesting, and an increase in the fair value of the securities portfolio. 
 
 The Company's Board of Directors authorized a 2,000,000 share stock repurchase program in the second quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has approximately 1.9 million shares remaining in the plan. 
 
 WaterStone Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At September 30, 2024, WaterStone Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. See Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 7 - Regulatory Capital. 
 
 Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into 60.0 million of new long-term debt and repaid 160.7 million of short-term debt. 
 
 See Note 6 - Borrowings of the notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information about the remaining maturities of our FHLB long-term debt. 
 
 Our commitments, contingent liabilities, and off-balance sheet arrangements have not changed materially since previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 See Note 9 - Commitments, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Contingent Liabilities of the notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Management of Market Risk 
 
 General . The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of mortgage loans, have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, WaterStone Bank s board of directors has established an Asset/Liability Committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors. Management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the Asset/Liability Committee meets at least weekly to review our asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position, which are evaluated quarterly. 
 
 We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: (i) emphasizing variable rate loans including variable rate one- to four-family, and commercial real estate loans as well as three to five year commercial real estate balloon loans; (ii) reducing and shortening the expected average life of the investment portfolio; and (iii) whenever possible, lengthening the term structure of our deposit base and our borrowings from the FHLB. These measures should reduce the volatility of our net interest income in different interest rate environments. 
 
 Income Simulation . Simulation analysis is an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time. At least quarterly we review the potential effect changes in interest rates may have on the repayment or repricing of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities. Our most recent simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at September 30, 2024 on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated repayments and scheduled rate adjustments. Prepayment rate assumptions may have a significant impact on interest income simulation results. Because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage-backed securities we hold, rising or falling interest rates may have a significant impact on the actual prepayment speeds of our mortgage related assets that may in turn affect our interest rate sensitivity position. When interest rates rise, prepayment speeds slow and the average expected lives of our assets would tend to lengthen more than the expected average lives of our liabilities and therefore would most likely have a positive impact on net interest income and earnings. 
 
 The following interest rate scenario displays the percentage change in net interest income over a one-year time horizon assuming increases of 100, 200 and 300 basis points and a decreases of 100 basis points. The results incorporate actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet accounts following an instantaneous parallel change in market rates based upon a static no growth, balance sheet.
