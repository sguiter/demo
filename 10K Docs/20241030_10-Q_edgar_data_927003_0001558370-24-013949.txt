No other customer s account receivable exceeded 10 of our total accounts receivable in the periods presented. Income tax provision (benefit) ) Effective tax rate ) Our effective tax rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of primarily due to the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates, as well as tax credits, partially offset by net U.S. tax on foreign operations. The previously announced Zhongshan, China factory closure impacted our effective tax rate in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate was higher than the same period in the prior year due to smaller beneficial discrete items in the current period relative to the larger beneficial discrete items in the prior period. As of January 1, 2024, the Pillar II minimum global effective tax rate of 15 enacted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD was effectuated. More than 140 countries agreed to enact the Pillar II global minimum tax. However, the timing of the implementation for each country varies. To date, we have determined that there was an immaterial global minimum tax liability as a result of Pillar II, as certain tax jurisdictions either will not have Pillar II enacted until after December 31, 2024 or satisfied the safe harbor test to prevent any minimum tax under Pillar II. We continue to monitor the jurisdictions for any changes and include any appropriate minimum tax throughout the year.

In connection with the 2024 Plan, we recorded a 28.5 million charge primarily associated with expected employment-related charges and facility exit costs. We expect to incur 1.0 million to 2.0 million in additional charges related to our announced actions and continue to evaluate our operations and cost structure, which could result in incremental restructuring charges in future periods. For additional information, see Note 11. Restructuring, Asset Impairments, and Other Charges in Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit Agreement Amendment On September 9, 2024, we used existing cash on hand to prepay the full 345.0 million outstanding principal balance under our Term Loan Facility. As of September 30, 2024, our only outstanding debt is the Convertible Notes due in 2028. On the same date, we entered into an additional amendment to the Credit Agreement to increase the capacity on the Revolving Facility from 200.0 million to 600.0 million. See Note 16.

End Markets Summary The demand environment in each of our markets is impacted by macroeconomic conditions, various market trends, customer buying patterns, design wins, and other factors. Although we are currently experiencing a lower demand environment in certain markets, we continue to believe that the long-term market growth drivers support our long-term strategy, research and development efforts, and capital investments. However, in the short-term it is unclear how certain macroeconomic conditions, including the effect of higher interest rates impacting end customers capital investment, the timing of inventory digestion, and customer buying patterns, will affect customer demand and our revenue . Semiconductor Equipment Market The Semiconductor Equipment market is slowly recovering from a cyclical downturn, which began in the fourth quarter of 2022. Since the market bottomed in 2023, demand had modestly recovered in the first nine months of 2024, but a number of external factors continued to limit the market, including unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, prolonged weak demand for consumer electronics, low fab utilization, and U.S. export restrictions to China. We continue to believe the long-term growth drivers will support cyclical growth for this market as more manufacturing capacity is needed to support increasing demand for semiconductor devices and related capital equipment. Industrial and Medical Market Beginning in the second half of 2023, the impact of weaker macroeconomic conditions started to impact demand for our products in the Industrial and Medical Market. In addition, in the first nine months of 2024, elevated inventory levels of our products following the supply chain crisis and extended lead times resulted in high levels of inventory rebalancing by our customers. We expect these factors will continue to limit our revenue levels in the near term, but we believe the long-term growth drivers will enable growth to return to this market after end markets recover and our customer inventories return to normal levels. Data Center Computing Market The Data Center Computing Market experienced weak demand starting in the first quarter of 2023 and continued until the first quarter of 2024, driven by reduced investments of our hyperscale customers, lower demand for Enterprise systems and the timing impact of large customer orders on our revenues. Starting in the second quarter of 2024, demand rebounded from both our hyperscale and enterprise customers, driven by accelerated investments in artificial intelligence and improved demand in the traditional server market, which we expect to continue for several quarters. Telecom and Networking Market Starting in 2023, leading companies in both the telecom and networking markets reported weakening demand. However, improved supply of critical components in 2023 drove higher customer orders and more than offset weakening market conditions, which continued in 2024. As end demand softens and customers rebalance their elevated inventory levels of our products, demand for our products declined meaningfully in the first nine months of 2024, which we expect to continue for several quarters.

This offset a modest revenue recovery in the Semiconductor Equipment market from the trough level a year ago and a demand recovery in the Data Center Computing market. Total revenues in the nine month period decreased from the same periods in the prior year due primarily to customer inventory rebalancing, resulting in lower demand in our Industrial and Medical and Telecom and Networking markets. The Semiconductor Equipment market modestly recovered from the cyclical trough in 2023, and revenue in the Data Center Computing market was impacted by weak demand in the first quarter followed by a rebound beginning in the second and third quarter driven by investments in artificial intelligence.

 The decrease in Telecom and Networking revenues for both the three and nine month periods was due to the prior year benefit of improved supply of critical components. This enabled fulfillment of outstanding orders in 2023, which did not continue in 2024. In addition, we experienced a slow demand environment and inventory rebalancing from our customers, which we expect to continue. Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross margin declined in both periods due to the decline in volume, which drove manufacturing utilization lower. This was partially offset by more favorable product mix, savings realized from our restructuring programs, and lower premiums paid for scarce parts.

In connection with the 2024 Plan, we recorded a 28.5 million charge primarily associated with expected employment-related charges and facility exit costs. We expect to incur 1.0 million to 2.0 million in additional charges related to our announced actions and continue to evaluate our operations and cost structure, which could result in incremental restructuring charges in future periods.

Interest expense increased due to interest associated with the Convertible Notes and a higher interest rate on the portion of our Term Loan Facility subject to a variable interest rate. We prepaid in full the Term Loan Facility on September 9, 2024, and the interest rate swap contracts expired on September 10, 2024. Should we have future borrowings under our Term Loan Facility or Revolving Facility, those borrowings would be subject to a variable rate. See Note 16. Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our debt. Other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous items. We had unrealized foreign exchange losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to unrealized gains in the same periods in the prior year. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred costs associated with foreign currency translation adjustments related to liquidated foreign operations and debt discount and fees associated with our Term Loan Facility prepayment. There were no such costs during the same periods in the prior year.

 Income Tax The following table summarizes tax provision (benefit) (in thousands) and the effective tax rate for our income from continuing operations: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Income (loss) from continuing operations, before income tax (14,547) 34,525 11,796 106,263 Income tax provision (benefit) (400) 874 4,552 13,405 Effective tax rate (2.7) 2.5 38.6 12.6 Our effective tax rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates, as well as tax credits, partially offset by net U.S. tax on foreign operations. The previously announced Zhongshan, China factory closure impacted our effective tax rate in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate was higher than the same period in the prior year due to smaller beneficial discrete items in the current period relative to the larger beneficial discrete items in the prior period. As of January 1, 2024, the Pillar II minimum global effective tax rate of 15 enacted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD was effectuated. More than 140 countries agreed to enact the Pillar II global minimum tax. However, the timing of the implementation for each country varies. To date, we have determined that there was an immaterial global minimum tax liability as a result of Pillar II, as certain tax jurisdictions either will not have Pillar II enacted until after December 31, 2024 or satisfied the safe harbor test to prevent any minimum tax under Pillar II. We continue to monitor the jurisdictions for any changes and include any appropriate minimum tax throughout the year.

 Non-GAAP Results Management uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share EPS to evaluate business performance without the impacts of certain non-cash charges and other charges which are not part of our usual operations. We use these non-GAAP measures to assess performance against business objectives and make business decisions, including developing budgets and forecasting future periods. In addition, management s incentive plans include these non-GAAP measures as criteria for achievements. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. However, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide additional information that enables readers to evaluate our business from the perspective of management. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP results presented below exclude the impact of non-cash related charges, such as stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and long-term unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses. In addition, we exclude discontinued operations and other non-recurring items such as acquisition-related costs, facility expansion and related costs, and restructuring expenses, as they are not indicative of future performance. The tax effect of our non-GAAP adjustments represents the anticipated annual tax rate applied to each non-GAAP adjustment after consideration of their respective book and tax treatments.

Our ability to fund our operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and product development efforts may depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to future operating performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. Our primary sources of liquidity continue to be our available cash, cash generated from operations, and available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility (defined in Note 16. Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements ).

Table of Contents 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 657.3 million, while our available funding under our Revolving Facility was 600.0 million. Additionally, we generated 50.3 million of cash flow from continuing operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We believe our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet anticipated debt service, share repurchase programs, and dividends. During the ordinary course of business, we evaluate our cash requirements and, if necessary, adjust our expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected revenue and demand. Our capital expenditures are primarily directed towards manufacturing and operations and can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives. In addition, we may seek additional debt or equity financing from time to time; however, such additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Debt On September 9, 2024, we used existing cash on hand to prepay the full 345.0 million outstanding principal balance under our Term Loan Facility. On the same date, we entered into an additional amendment to the Credit Agreement to increase the capacity on the Revolving Facility from 200.0 million to 600.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, our only outstanding debt is the 575.0 million Convertible Notes, which mature on September 15, 2028 and carry a 2.5 interest rate. See Note 16. Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The interest rate swap contracts previously entered into related to the Term Loan Facility expired on September 10, 2024. Should we have future borrowings under our Term Loan Facility or Revolving Facility, those borrowings would be subject to a variable rate. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Facility, and we had 600.0 million in available funding. In addition to the available capacity on the Revolving Facility, prior to the maturity date of our Credit Agreement, we may request an increase to the financing commitments in either the Term Loan Facility or Revolving Facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed 250.0 million. Any requested increase is subject to lender approval. For more information see Note 16. Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. Dividends During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid quarterly cash dividends of 0.10 per share, totaling 11.5 million. We currently anticipate that a cash dividend of 0.10 per share will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, and other factors.

 Cash Flows A summary of our cash from operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations 50,250 128,240 Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations (2,191) (3,307) Net cash from operating activities 48,059 124,933 Net cash used in investing activities (60,505) (50,229) Net cash used in financing activities (374,433) 454,204 Effect of currency translation on cash and cash equivalents (389) (1,795) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (387,268) 527,113 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,044,556 458,818 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 657,288 985,931 Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 50.3 million, as compared to 128.2 million for the same period in the prior year. This 77.9 million decrease was primarily due to lower net income from continuing operations. Additionally, during the current year, we had a significant use of cash for inventories due to a strategic inventory buildup as well as lower cash flow from accounts receivable as a result of a decline in revenue. In addition, we had unfavorable changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 60.5 million, primarily driven by the following: 44.0 million in purchases of property and equipment largely driven by investments in our manufacturing footprint and capacity; 13.8 million for the Airity acquisition; and 2.7 million in purchases of investments. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 50.2 million, primarily driven by the following: 46.8 million in purchases of property and equipment largely driven by investments in our manufacturing footprint and capacity; and 3.4 million in purchases of investments. 
 Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 374.4 million and included the following: 355.0 million for repayment of long-term debt;

Table of Contents 
 11.5 million for dividend payments; 1.8 million for repurchase of common stock; and 6.0 million in net payments related to stock-based award activities. 
 Net cash from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 454.2 million and included the following: 562.0 million net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt; 74.9 million proceeds from the sale of Warrants; 115.0 million for purchase of Note Hedges; 40.0 million for repurchase of common stock; 15.0 million for repayment of long-term debt; 
 11.4 million for dividend payments; and 1.3 million in net payments related to stock-based award activities. 
 Effect of Currency Translation on Cash During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on cash. See Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk in Part I, Item 3 for more information . Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1. Summary of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates to the consolidated financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting estimates, discussed in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of the 2023 Form 10-K, include assessing excess and obsolete inventories, accounting for income taxes, and estimates for the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. Such accounting policies and estimates require significant judgments and assumptions to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on variability in factors affecting these estimates.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk and Risk Management In the normal course of business, we have exposure to interest rate risk from our investments and the Credit Agreement. We also have exposure to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations and foreign currency transactions. See Risk Factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II of this report, for more information about the market risks to which we are exposed. There have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk from December 31, 2023. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates through revenue and purchasing transactions when we sell products and purchase materials in currencies different from the currency in which product and manufacturing costs were incurred. Our reported financial results of operations, including the reported value of our assets and liabilities, are also impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Assets and liabilities of substantially all our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are translated at period end rates of exchange for each reporting period. Operating results and cash flow statements are translated at average rates of exchange during each reporting period. Although these translation changes have no immediate cash impact, the translation changes may impact future borrowing capacity, and overall value of our net assets. The functional currencies of our worldwide facilities primarily include the United States Dollar, Euro, South Korean Won, New Taiwan Dollar, Japanese Yen, Pound Sterling, and Chinese Yuan. We are subject to risks associated with revenue and purchasing activities and costs to operate that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies, such as the Singapore Dollar, Malaysian Ringgit, Mexican Peso, Philippine Peso, and Thai Baht. Historically, the impact of changes to these particular exchange rates has not been material to our operating results. From time to time, we may enter into foreign currency exchange rate contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities expected to be settled at a future date, including foreign currency, which may be required for a potential foreign acquisition. Market risk arises from the potential adverse effects on the value of derivative instruments that result from a change in foreign currency exchange rates. We may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the exchange rate risk associated with intercompany debt denominated in nonfunctional currencies. We minimize our market risk applicable to foreign currency exchange rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of our derivative contract instruments. We enter into derivative contract instruments for risk management purposes only. We do not enter into or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk At the present time, a change in interest rates does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow because our only outstanding debt is the Convertible Notes, which carry a fixed 2.5 interest rate. However, increases in interest rates could impact the decision to borrow under our Credit Agreement, ability to refinance existing maturities, and acquire additional debt on favorable terms. For more information see Note 16. Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Principal Executive Officer (Stephen D. Kelley, President and Chief Executive Officer) and Principal Financial Officer (Paul Oldham, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. The conclusions of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer from this evaluation were communicated to the Audit and Finance Committee. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We intend to continue to review and document our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal controls over financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting excludes Airity, which we acquired in a business combination on June 20, 2024. See Note 2. Acquisitions in Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. Airity s total assets and total revenue excluded from management s assessment represent less than 1 of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of September 30, 2024. Aside from the above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of our business. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Information concerning our risk factors is contained in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K. The risks described in the 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K.

 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS To repurchase shares of our common stock, we periodically enter into stock repurchase agreements, open market transactions, and/or other transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Before repurchasing our shares, we consider the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities, available liquidity, cash flows from operations, general business and economic conditions, and other relevant factors. The following table summarizes these repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2024: 

Month Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Maximum Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (in thousands, except price per share data) July 1 to July 31, 2024 199,192 August 1 to August 31, 2024 199,192 September 1 to September 30, 2024 19 93.58 19 197,404 At September 30, 2024, the remaining amount authorized by the Board of Directors for future share repurchases was 197.4 million with no time limitation.
