ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 For information about the significant risks that could affect PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K, as supplemented below and the section of this quarterly report entitled Forward-Looking Statements. 

PG E Corporation is a holding company and relies on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances, and transfers of funds from the Utility to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its obligations. 
 
 PG E Corporation conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiary, the Utility, and substantially all of PG E Corporation s consolidated assets are held by the Utility. Accordingly, PG E Corporation s cash flow, ability to pay dividends on its common stock, and ability to meet its debt service obligations under its existing and future indebtedness largely depend upon the earnings and cash flows of the Utility and the distribution of these earnings and cash flows to PG E Corporation. The ability of the Utility to pay dividends or make other advances, distributions, and transfers of funds will depend on its results of operations and is restricted by, among other things, applicable laws limiting the amount of funds available for payment of dividends and certain restrictive covenants contained in financing agreements. See Liquidity and Financial Resources in Item 7. MD A in the 2023 Form 10-K. The Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including its obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to meet its obligations to employees and creditors, and to pay preferred stock dividends, before it can distribute cash to PG E Corporation. In particular, the CPUC requires PG E Corporation s and the Utility s Boards of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. The CPUC also regulates the Utility s capital structure. Dividend payments on PG E Corporation s common stock are also subject to the discretion of PG E Corporation s Board of Directors. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1. 
 
 The deterioration of income from, or other available assets of, the Utility for any reason could limit or impair the Utility s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to PG E Corporation, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect PG E Corporation s ability to pay common stock dividends or meet other obligations.

PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

OVERVIEW 
 
 This is a combined quarterly report of PG E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with each company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1. It should also be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Key Factors Affecting Financial Results 
 
 PG E Corporation and the Utility believe that their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the following factors: 
 
 The Uncertainties in Connection with Wildfires, Wildfire Mitigation, and Associated Cost Recovery. PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the costs and effectiveness of the Utility s wildfire mitigation initiatives; the extent of damages from wildfires that do occur; the financial impacts of wildfires; and PG E Corporation s and the Utility s ability to mitigate those financial impacts with insurance, the Wildfire Fund, and regulatory recovery. 
 
 In response to the wildfire threat facing California, PG E Corporation and the Utility have taken aggressive steps to mitigate the threat of catastrophic wildfires. The Utility s wildfire mitigation initiatives include Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings EPSS ), PSPS, vegetation management, asset inspections, and system hardening (such as undergrounding). In particular, in 2023, the Utility introduced or expanded its use of several measures including downed conductor detection, partial voltage force outs, and transmission operational controls. The Utility s wildfire mitigation efforts have also benefited in recent years from improved ignition response and situational awareness tools like weather stations and risk modeling. These initiatives have significantly reduced the number of CPUC-reportable ignitions and the number of acres burned from utility-related ignitions. The success of the Utility s wildfire mitigation efforts depends on many factors, including whether the Utility can retain or contract for the workforce necessary to execute its wildfire mitigation actions. 
 
 PG E Corporation and the Utility have incurred and will continue to incur substantial expenditures in connection with these initiatives. For more information on incurred expenditures, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. The extent to which the Utility will be able to recover these expenditures and other potential costs through rates is uncertain. If additional requirements are imposed that go beyond current expectations, such requirements could have a substantial impact on the costs of the Utility s wildfire mitigation initiatives. 
 
 The Utility is subject to a number of legal and regulatory requirements related to its wildfire mitigation efforts, which require periodic inspections of electric assets and ongoing reporting related to this work. Although the Utility believes that it has complied substantially with these requirements, it continually reviews and has identified instances of noncompliance. The Utility intends to update the CPUC and the OEIS as its review progresses. The Utility could face fines, penalties, enforcement action, or other adverse legal or regulatory consequences for late inspections or other noncompliance related to wildfire mitigation efforts. See Self-Reports to the CPUC in Regulatory Matters below. 
 
 Despite these extensive measures, the potential that the Utility s equipment will be involved in the ignition of future wildfires, including catastrophic wildfires, is significant. This risk may be attributable to, and exacerbated by, a variety of factors, including climate (in particular, extended periods of seasonal dryness coupled with periods of high wind velocities and other storms), infrastructure, and vegetation conditions. Once an ignition has occurred, the Utility may be unable to control the extent of damages, which is primarily determined by environmental conditions (including weather and vegetation conditions), third-party suppression efforts, and the location of the wildfire. 
 
 The financial impact of past wildfires is significant. As of September 30, 2024, PG E Corporation and the Utility had recorded aggregate liabilities of 1.2 billion, 1.875 billion, and 100 million for claims in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire, respectively, and in each case before available insurance, and, in the case of the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire, other probable cost recoveries. These liability amounts correspond to the lower end of the range of reasonably estimable probable losses. 
 12 

PG E Corporation and the Utility may be able to mitigate the financial impact of future wildfires in excess of insurance coverage through the Wildfire Fund, or cost recovery through rates. Each of these mitigations involves uncertainties, and liabilities could exceed available recoveries. See Loss Recoveries in Note 10 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Utility has recorded insurance receivables of 430 million for the 2019 Kincade fire, 525 million for the 2021 Dixie fire, and 86 million for the 2022 Mosquito fire. Recorded liabilities in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2021 Dixie fire have exceeded potential amounts recoverable under applicable insurance policies. 
 
 If the eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires were to exceed 1.0 billion in any Wildfire Fund coverage year Coverage Year ), the Utility may be eligible to make a claim against the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 for such excess amount. The Wildfire Fund is available to the Utility to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires, provided that the Utility satisfies the conditions to the Utility s ongoing participation in the Wildfire Fund set forth in AB 1054 and that the Wildfire Fund has sufficient remaining funds. However, the impact of AB 1054 on PG E Corporation and the Utility is subject to numerous uncertainties, including the Utility s ability to demonstrate to the CPUC that wildfire-related costs paid from the Wildfire Fund were just and reasonable and therefore not subject to reimbursement, and whether the benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund ultimately outweigh its substantial costs. Finally, recoveries for the 2019 Kincade fire would be subject to a 40 limitation on the allowed amount of claims arising before emergence from bankruptcy. As of September 30, 2024, the Utility has recorded a Wildfire Fund receivable of 875 million for the 2021 Dixie fire. See Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 in Note 10 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. 
 
 The Utility will be permitted to recover its wildfire-related claims in excess of insurance and legal fees through rates unless the CPUC or the FERC, as applicable, determines that the Utility has not met the applicable prudency standard. The revised prudency standard under AB 1054 has not been interpreted or applied by the CPUC, and it is possible that the CPUC could interpret the standard or apply it to the relevant facts differently from how the Utility has interpreted and applied the standard, in which case the Utility may not be able to recover all or a portion of expenses that it has recorded as receivables. As of September 30, 2024, the Utility has recorded receivables for regulatory recovery of 598 million for the 2021 Dixie fire and 60 million for the 2022 Mosquito fire. See 2021 Dixie Fire, and 2022 Mosquito Fire in Note 10 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 for more information. 
 
 The Timing and Outcome of Ratemaking and Other Proceedings. Regulatory ratemaking proceedings are a key aspect of the Utility s business. The Utility s revenue requirements consist primarily of a base amount set to enable the Utility to recover its reasonable operating expenses (e.g., maintenance, administrative and general expenses) and capital costs (e.g., depreciation and financing expenses). The CPUC also authorizes the Utility to collect revenues to recover costs that the Utility is allowed to pass through to customers, including its costs to procure electricity and natural gas for customers and to administer public purpose and customer programs. Although the Utility generally seeks to recover its recorded costs on a timely basis, in recent years, the amount of the costs recorded in memorandum and balancing accounts has increased. Other proceedings that could impact the Utility s business profile and financial results include actions by municipalities and other public entities to acquire the electric assets of the Utility within their respective jurisdictions. The outcome of regulatory proceedings can be affected by many factors, including intervening parties testimonies, potential rate impacts, the regulatory and political environments, and other factors. See Notes 3 and 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1, and Regulatory Matters below. 
 
 PG E Corporation s and the Utility s Ability to Control Operating and Financing Costs. Under cost-of-service ratemaking, a utility s earnings depend on its ability to manage costs within the amounts authorized for recovery in its ratemaking proceedings. The Utility has set a goal to increase its capital investments to meet safety and climate goals, while also achieving operating cost savings. The Utility plans to achieve such savings by improving the planning and execution of its work through increased efficiencies, including waste elimination through the Lean operating system. PG E Corporation and the Utility also work to minimize financing costs by identifying and executing on opportunities to efficiently finance the business, which depends on capital market conditions.

For more information about the risks that could materially affect PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, or that could cause future results to differ from historical results, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q and the 2023 Form 10-K and Forward-Looking Statements above for a list of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially. 

Tax Matters 
 
 PG E Corporation had a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately 32.9 billion and a California net operating loss carryforward of approximately 32.6 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Under Section 382 of the IRC, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an ownership change, net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally five percent shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50 over such shareholders lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). PG E Corporation s and the Utility s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, each filed on June 22, 2020, and for PG E Corporation, as amended by the Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation, filed on May 24, 2022 (the Amended Articles limit Transfers (as defined in the Amended Articles) that increase a person s or entity s (including certain groups of persons) ownership of PG E Corporation s equity securities to 4.75 or more prior to the Restriction Release Date (as defined in the Amended Articles) without approval by the Board of Directors of PG E Corporation. Shares of PG E Corporation common stock held directly by the Utility are attributed to PG E Corporation for income tax purposes and are therefore effectively excluded from the total number of outstanding equity securities when calculating a person s Percentage Stock Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) for purposes of the 4.75 ownership limitation in the Amended Articles. For example, although PG E Corporation had 2,615,288,444 shares outstanding as of October 30, 2024, only 2,137,544,854 shares (the number of outstanding shares of common stock less the number of shares held directly by the Utility) count as outstanding for purposes of the ownership restrictions in the Amended Articles. As such, a person s effective Percentage Stock Ownership limitation for purposes of the Amended Articles as of October 30, 2024 was 3.88 of PG E Corporation s outstanding shares. 
 
 As of the date of this report, it is more likely than not that PG E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change, and consequently, its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the IRC.

Operating Revenues 
 
 The Utility s electric and natural gas operating revenues increased by 53 million, or 1 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These increases were primarily due to: 
 
 approximately 735 million in increased base revenues authorized in the 2023 GRC in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023; 
 
 an increase of approximately 245 million in revenues as authorized through the FERC formula rate in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023; 
 
 approximately 130 million in interim rate relief authorized in the WGSC proceeding (see Wildfire and Gas Safety Costs Recovery Application below) in the three months ended September 30, 2024, with no comparable revenues in the same period in 2023; and 
 
 approximately 85 million related to the 2021 NDCTP final decision that ordered the Utility to issue a refund of the Non-Qualified Trust to customers in the three months ended September 30, 2023 with no comparable refund in the same period in 2024. 
 
 15 

Partially offset by: 
 
 approximately 740 million in revenues authorized in the final 2021 WMCE decision (see 2021 WMCE Application below) in the three months ended September 30, 2023, with no comparable revenues in the same period in 2024; 
 
 approximately 270 million in interim rate relief authorized in the 2022 WMCE proceeding (see 2022 WMCE Application below) in the three months ended September 30, 2023, with no comparable revenues in the same period in 2024; and 
 
 a decrease of approximately 140 million in revenues to recover the costs associated with lower allowance for doubtful accounts under-collections from residential customers in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. 
 
 The Utility s electric and natural gas operating revenues increased by 401 million, or 2 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These increases were primarily due to: 
 
 approximately 2.2 billion in increased base revenues authorized in the 2023 GRC in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023; 
 
 an increase of approximately 270 million in interim rate relief authorized in the 2022 WMCE proceeding (see 2022 WMCE Application below) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023; 
 
 an increase of approximately 260 million in revenues as authorized through the FERC formula rate in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023; 
 
 approximately 260 million in interim rate relief authorized in the WGSC proceeding (see Wildfire and Gas Safety Costs Recovery Application below) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with no comparable revenues in the same period in 2023; and 
 
 approximately 85 million related to the 2021 NDCTP final decision that ordered the Utility to issue a refund of the Non-Qualified Trust to customers in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 with no comparable refund in the same period in 2024. 
 
 Partially offset by: 
 
 approximately 740 million in revenues authorized in the final 2021 WMCE decision (see 2021 WMCE Application below) in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with no comparable revenues in the same period in 2024; 
 
 approximately 585 million in revenues authorized in the final 2020 WMCE decision in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with no comparable revenues in the same period in 2024; 
 
 a decrease in revenues to recover the cost of electricity procurement, which decreased by approximately 120 million and the cost of natural gas, which decreased by approximately 530 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. These costs are passed through to customers and do not impact net income. See Cost of Electricity and Cost of Natural Gas below; 
 
 a decrease of approximately 295 million in revenues to recover the costs associated with the Risk Transfer Balancing Account RTBA in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. For more information, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K; and 
 
 a decrease of approximately 280 million in revenues to recover the costs associated with lower allowance for doubtful accounts under-collections from residential customers in the the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. 
 
 16 

Cost of Electricity 
 
 The Utility s Cost of electricity includes the cost of power purchased from third parties (including renewable energy resources), fuel and associated transmission costs used in its own generation facilities, fuel and associated transmission costs supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements, costs to comply with California s cap-and-trade program, and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Cost of electricity also includes net energy sales (Utility owned and third parties generation) in the CAISO electricity markets and directly with third parties. The Utility s total purchased power is driven by customer demand, net CAISO electricity market activities (purchases or sales), the availability of the Utility s own generation facilities (including Diablo Canyon and its hydroelectric plants), and the cost-effectiveness of each source of electricity. Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Cost of purchased power, net 
 754 752 1,700 1,518 Fuel used in generation facilities 81 94 219 522 Total cost of electricity 835 846 1,919 2,040 
 
 The Cost of electricity decreased by 11 million, or 1 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases were primarily the result of lower natural gas market prices included as fuel costs. 
 
 The Cost of electricity decreased by 121 million, or 6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases were primarily the result of lower natural gas market prices included as fuels costs, partially offset by lower CAISO market sales revenues. 

Cost of Natural Gas 
 
 The Utility s Cost of natural gas includes the costs of procurement, storage and transportation of natural gas, costs to comply with California s cap-and-trade program and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Cost of natural gas sold 48 116 691 1,226 Transportation cost of natural gas sold 41 42 131 122 Total cost of natural gas 89 158 822 1,348 
 
 The Cost of natural gas decreased by 69 million, or 44 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases were primarily the result of lower natural gas procurement costs, due to lower natural gas market prices for the period. 
 
 The Cost of natural gas decreased by 526 million, or 39 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases were primarily the result of lower natural gas procurement costs, partially offset by less favorable price risk management results, both of which were due to lower natural gas market prices for the period. 

Operating and Maintenance 
 
 The Utility s Operating and maintenance expenses decreased by 458 million, or 15 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases were primarily due to: 
 
 approximately 720 million of previously deferred expenses authorized in the 2021 WMCE decision (see 2021 WMCE Application below) in the three months ended September 30, 2023, with no comparable costs in the same period in 2024; 
 
 approximately 270 million of previously deferred expenses authorized in the 2022 WMCE proceeding (see 2022 WMCE Application below) in the three months ended September 30, 2023, with no comparable costs in the same period in 2024; 
 
 17 

a decrease of approximately 140 million in costs associated with lower allowance for doubtful accounts under-collections from residential customers in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1; and 
 
 a decrease of approximately 40 million in insurance costs related to the Utility s adoption of self-insurance in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Partially offset by: 
 
 an increase of approximately 250 million in costs related to VMBA in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023; 
 
 approximately 210 million in costs related to a FERC order denying the capitalization of certain vegetation management costs and ordering the Utility to record these as operating expense, resulting in an increase in operating expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024, with no comparable costs in the same period in 2023; 
 
 approximately 130 million in interim rate relief authorized in the WGSC proceeding (see Wildfire and Gas Safety Costs Recovery Application below) in the three months ended September 30, 2024, with no comparable costs in the same period in 2023; and 
 
 approximately 110 million of previously deferred expenses as a result of the 2023 GRC in the three months ended September 30, 2024, with no comparable costs in the same period in 2023. 
 
 The Utility s Operating and maintenance expenses decreased by 179 million, or 2 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases were primarily due to: 
 
 approximately 720 million of previously deferred expenses authorized in the 2021 WMCE decision (see 2021 WMCE Application below) in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with no comparable costs in the same period in 2024; 
 
 approximately 420 million of previously deferred expenses authorized in the final 2020 WMCE decision in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with no comparable costs in 2024; 
 
 a decrease of approximately 280 million in costs associated with lower allowance for doubtful accounts under-collections from residential customers in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1; and 
 
 a decrease of approximately 340 million in insurance costs related to the Utility s adoption of self-insurance in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Partially offset by: 
 
 approximately 330 million of previously deferred expenses as a result of the 2023 GRC in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with no comparable costs in 2023; 
 
 an increase of approximately 270 million of previously deferred expenses authorized in the 2022 WMCE proceeding (see 2022 WMCE Application below) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023; 
 
 approximately 260 million in interim rate relief authorized in the WGSC proceeding (see Wildfire and Gas Safety Costs Recovery Application below) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with no comparable costs in the same period in 2023; 
 
 an increase of approximately 250 million in costs related to VMBA in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023; 
 
 approximately 210 million in costs related to a FERC order denying the capitalization of certain vegetation management costs, ordering the Utility to reclassify these costs to operating expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with no comparable costs in the same period in 2023; and 
 18 

the write-off of approximately 60 million of costs as a result of the CPUC s final decision denying the Pacific Generation application in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with no comparable costs in the same period in 2023. For more information, see Regulatory Matters below. 

SB 901 Securitization Charges, Net 
 
 The Utility s SB 901 securitization charges, net decreased by 313 million, or 90 , and 875 million, or 96 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Utility recorded charges of 346 million and 908 million, respectively, representing the amounts that are refundable to ratepayers as a result of tax benefits realized within income tax expense related to the Fire Victim Trust s sale of PG E Corporation common stock as well as amortization of Wildfire Fund contributions under AB 1054, as compared to charges of 33 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to amortization of Wildfire Fund contributions under AB 1054. For more information, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 and Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 in Note 10 below. 

Wildfire-Related Claims, Net of Recoveries 
 
 The Utility s Wildfire-related claims, net of recoveries increased by 106 million, or 331 , and 105 million, or 300 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The Utility recognized pre-tax charges of 425 million related to the 2021 Dixie fire offset by probable recoveries through the Wildfire Fund and WEMA in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to pre-tax charges of 275 million related to the 2021 Dixie fire offset by probable recoveries through the Wildfire Fund and 75 million related to the 2019 Kincade fire in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Wildfire Fund Expense 
 
 The Utility s Wildfire Fund expense decreased by 80 million, or 37 , and 158 million, or 35 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. These decreases were primarily due to less accelerated amortization of the Wildfire Fund asset and an increase in the estimated period of coverage of the Wildfire Fund from 15 to 20 years. For more information, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. 

Depreciation, Amortization, and Decommissioning 
 
 The Utility's Depreciation, amortization and decommissioning expenses increased by 248 million, or 31 , and 249 million, or 9 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. These increases were primarily due to the growth in plant balance from capital additions, an increase in depreciation expense for costs awaiting regulatory decisions, and an increase in decommissioning expense due to the reversal of approximately 175 million in accrued nuclear decommissioning expense as a result of the 2021 NDCTP final decision in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, with no comparable reversals in the same periods in 2024. 

Interest Income 
 
 There was no material change to Interest income in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Utility s Interest income increased by 85 million, or 21 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher interest rates earned on regulatory balancing accounts. 

Interest Expense 
 
 The Utility s Interest expense increased by 127 million, or 21 , and 458 million, or 27 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. These increases were primarily due to an increase in long term debt and short-term debt, reversals of interest expense cost deferrals recorded in prior periods, and higher interest rates paid on regulatory balancing accounts. 

Other Income, Net 
 
 There was no material change to Other income, net of recoveries for the periods presented. 
 
 19 

Income Tax Provision (Benefit) 
 
 The Utility s Income tax provision increased by 327 million, or 82 , and 1.1 billion, or 109 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in the tax benefit recognized related to the Fire Victim Trust s sale of PG E Corporation common stock as well as higher pre-tax income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 The following table reconciles the income tax expense at the federal statutory rate to the income tax provision: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Federal statutory income tax rate 21.0 21.0 21.0 21.0 Increase (decrease) in income tax rate resulting from: State income tax (net of federal benefit) (1)

 (1) Includes the effect of state flow-through ratemaking treatment. 
 (2) Includes the effect of federal flow-through ratemaking treatment for certain property-related costs. For these temporary tax differences, the Utility recognizes the deferred tax impact in the current period and records offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities. Therefore, the Utility s effective tax rate is impacted as these differences arise and reverse. The Utility recognizes such differences as regulatory assets or liabilities as it is probable that these amounts will be recovered from or returned to customers in future rates. These amounts also reflect the impact of the amortization of excess deferred tax benefits to be refunded to customers as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. 
 (3) Includes the tax effect of the Fire Victim Trust s sale of PG E Corporation common stock in 2023. For more information, see Tax Matters in Item 7. MD A and Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K. 

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 
 PG E Corporation and the Utility expect to be able to generate and obtain adequate cash to meet their cash requirements in the short-term and in the long-term. 
 
 PG E Corporation s ability to fund operations, make scheduled principal and interest payments, fund equity contributions to the Utility, and pay dividends depends on the level of cash on hand, cash received from the Utility, and PG E Corporation s access to the capital and credit markets. Generally, PG E Corporation and the Utility expect that capital expenditures, debt maturities, and PG E Corporation common stock dividends will exceed operating cash flows. As a result, they expect to finance future cash needs in excess of operating cash flows primarily through the capital and credit markets. 
 
 PG E Corporation and the Utility have various contractual commitments which impact cash requirements. These commitments are discussed in Purchase Commitments in Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, PG E Corporation and the Utility had access to approximately 5.2 billion of total liquidity comprised of 712 million of the Utility s Cash and cash equivalents, which includes 305 million related to PERS, 183 million of PG E Corporation s Cash and cash equivalents and 4.3 billion of availability under PG E Corporation s and the Utility s revolving credit facilities.

Credit Ratings 
 
 Credit ratings impact the cost and availability of short-term borrowings, including credit facilities, and long-term debt costs. In addition, some of the Utility s commodity contracts contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. Contracts which may require collateral postings include the Utility's power and natural gas commodity, transportation, services, and environmental products agreements. Because the Utility s credit rating remains below investment grade, the Utility generally does not receive unsecured credit from its energy procurement counterparties and it may be required to increase its collateral postings if its credit rating is downgraded. 

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Restricted Cash Equivalents 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. PG E Corporation and the Utility maintain separate bank accounts and primarily invest their cash in money market funds. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Utility holds restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents that primarily consists of AB 1054 and SB 901 fixed recovery charge collections that are to be used to service the associated bonds. As of September 30, 2024, PG E Corporation and the Utility had Cash and cash equivalents of 183 million and 712 million, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Utility had contributed 768 million to PERS, its wholly-owned subsidiary and captive insurance company for the administration of wildfire liability self-insurance. As of September 2024, 305 million was classified as Cash and cash equivalents, 8 million was classified as Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents due to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and 449 million was classified as Other current assets due to investments in short-term securities. See Self-Insurance in Note 10 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. 
 
 Financial Resources 
 
 Equity Financings 
 
 PG E Corporation does not plan to issue any equity in 2024, except for employee compensation purposes. Factors that could affect PG E Corporation s planned equity issuances include liquidity and cash flow needs, capital expenditures, interest rates, its share price, its earnings, the timing and outcome of ratemaking proceedings, and the timing and terms of other financings.

 Other Financings 
 
 The Utility is seeking financing through the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment category of the DOE s Clean Energy Financing Program to help fund California s clean energy transition. 
 
 22 

On February 20, 2024, the Utility entered into an agreement with Citizens Energy Corporation Citizens pursuant to which the Utility may lease to Citizens entitlements to certain transmission assets. The costs related to such leased entitlements are and will continue to be excluded from the Utility s FERC transmission rates for the duration of the applicable lease. The Utility may offer Citizens up to five lease options over the term of the agreement, for a total investment by Citizens of up to 1.0 billion. If Citizens exercises and the parties close on a lease option, the Utility will receive an upfront payment as prepaid rent for that lease, which is expected to average approximately 200 million per lease, and the rate base associated with the leased entitlements will go into Citizens rate base, rather than the Utility s, for 30 years. The transactions contemplated by the agreement are subject to FERC and CPUC approvals of pending or forthcoming filings.

Utility Cash Flows 
 
 PG E Corporation s consolidated cash flows consist primarily of cash flows related to the Utility. The following discussion presents the Utility s cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 The Utility s cash flows were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 6,272 4,530 Net cash used in investing activities (8,219) (6,710) Net cash provided by financing activities 2,257 1,991 Net change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents 310 (189) 

Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 1.7 billion, or 38 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increases were primarily due to: 
 
 decrease in amounts paid for natural gas due to a decrease in natural gas commodity prices; and 
 
 an increase in collections through rates as a result of the 2023 GRC final decision. 
 
 Partially offset by: 
 
 an increase in climate credits issued to customers; and 
 
 lower returns for collateral posted in 2024 due to a decrease in the volatility of gas prices. 
 
 23 

The Utility s cash flows from operating activities primarily consist of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such as depreciation and amortization that do not require the use of cash. The Utility s receipts from customers are expected to increase primarily as a result of increases in the Utility s rate base and from cost recovery applications (see Cost Recovery Proceedings below for more information). 
 
 Future cash flow from operating activities will be affected by various factors, including: 
 
 the timing and amount of costs in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire and the timing and amount of any potential related insurance, Wildfire Fund, and regulatory recoveries; 
 
 the timing and amount of costs in connection with future wildfires and the timing and amount of any potential related insurance, including funds available from self-insurance and the Wildfire Fund (see Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 in Note 10 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1); 
 
 the timing and amount of costs in connection with the 2023-2025 WMP and the costs previously incurred in connection with the 2020-2022 WMP that are not currently being recovered through rates (see Regulatory Matters below for more information); 
 
 the timing and outcomes of the Utility s pending and future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings, including the extent to which PG E Corporation and the Utility are able to recover their costs through regulated rates as recorded in memorandum accounts or balancing accounts, or as otherwise requested; and 
 
 the timing and amount of electric commodity price volatility and differences between commodity costs and revenue collections. 
 
 PG E Corporation and the Utility do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on their financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources, other than those discussed under Purchase Commitments in Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. 

Investing Activities 
 
 The following table summarizes changes in key components of the Utility s investing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023. 
 (in millions) Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 Cash used in investing activities - 2023 (6,710) Capital expenditures (440) Net purchases related to customer credit trust investments (641) Purchases of self-insurance investments (449) Other investing activities 21 Net increase in cash used in investing activities (1,509) Cash used in investing activities - 2024 (8,219) 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 1.5 billion, or 22 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increases were primarily due to a 641 million increase in net purchases of customer credit trust investments, net of proceeds from sales, and a 449 million increase in purchases of self-insurance investments in 2024. In addition, capital expenditures increased by 440 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in capital work related to electric distribution, transmission and substation projects. 
 
 The Utility s investing activities primarily consist of the construction of new and replacement facilities necessary to provide safe and reliable electricity and natural gas services to its customers. Cash used in investing activities also includes the proceeds from sales of nuclear decommissioning trust, customer credit trust, and self-insurance investments which are partially offset by the amount of cash used to purchase new nuclear decommissioning trust, customer credit trust investments, and self-insurance investments. The funds in the decommissioning trusts, along with accumulated earnings, are used exclusively for decommissioning and dismantling the Utility s nuclear generation facilities. Pursuant to SB 901, the funds in the customer credit trust, along with accumulated earnings, are used exclusively to fund a monthly credit to customers. 
 24 

Future cash flows used in investing activities are largely dependent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures. The Utility estimates that it will incur 10.8 billion of capital expenditures in 2024. Additionally, future cash flows used in investing activities could be impacted by the timing and amount of contributions to the self-insurance captive (see Self-Insurance in Note 10 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1) and to the customer credit trust, including 650 million to be contributed by March 2025 (see Note 5 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1). 

Financing Activities 
 
 The following table summarizes changes in key components of the Utility s financing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023. 
 (in millions) Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 Cash provided by financing activities - 2023 1,991 Net borrowings under credit facilities (340) Repayments under term loan credit facilities (1,850) Issuance of long-term debt (1,691) Issuance of short-term debt 999 Proceeds from issuance of Series 2024-A senior secured recovery bonds 1,409 Proceeds related to DWR loans 980 Other financing activities 759 Net increase in cash provided by financing activities 266 Cash provided by financing activities - 2024 2,257 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased by 266 million, or 13 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increases were primarily due to: 
 
 1.4 billion in proceeds related to the issuance of Series 2024-A senior secured recovery bonds, with no similar transaction in 2023; 
 
 999 million in proceeds related to issuance of short-term debt, with no similar transaction in 2023; and 
 
 980 million in proceeds related to the DWR loan in 2024, with no similar transaction in 2023. 
 
 Partially offset by: 
 
 a 1.9 billion increase in repayments under term loan credit facilities; and 
 
 a 1.7 billion decrease in proceeds related to issuance of long-term debt. 
 
 Cash provided by or used in financing activities is driven by the Utility s financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by or used in operating activities, the level of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity date or prepayment date of existing debt instruments. Additionally, the Utility s future cash flows from financing activities will be affected by the timing and outcome of the Utility s ability to procure financing, dividend payments, and equity contributions from PG E Corporation. 

LITIGATION MATTERS 
 
 PG E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to the enforcement and litigation matters described in Notes 10 and 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 and in Regulatory Matters below that are incorporated by reference herein. The outcome of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
 
 25 

REGULATORY MATTERS 
 
 The Utility is subject to substantial regulation by the CPUC, the FERC, the OEIS, the NRC, and other federal and state regulatory agencies. The resolutions of the proceedings described below and other proceedings may materially affect PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Except as otherwise noted, PG E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the timing and outcome of the following proceedings. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and through the date of this filing, key updates to regulatory and legislative matters were as follows: 
 
 On October 17, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision in the Utility s 2023 Cost of Capital proceeding that changed the cost of capital adjustment mechanism and lowered the Utility s ROE from 10.70 to 10.28 effective January 1, 2025. 
 
 On September 12, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision on interim rate recovery in the Utility s 2023 WMCE that grants the Utility interim rate relief of 944 million, plus interest, subject to refund. 
 
 On August 29, 2024, the OEIS issued a draft decision approving the Utility s 2025 WMP update. 
 
 On August 22, 2024, the FERC issued an order approving the Utility s TO18 transmission rate case settlement as reasonable and in the public interest. 

Cost Recovery Proceedings 
 
 Periodically, costs arise that could not have been anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC proceedings or that have been deliberately excluded from such proceedings. For instance, these costs may result from catastrophic events, changes in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in a memorandum account and the CPUC may later authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incremental and prudently incurred. The CPUC may also authorize balancing accounts with limitations or caps on cost recovery. These accounts, which include the CEMA, WEMA, Fire Hazard Prevention Memorandum Account FHPMA ), FRMMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA, and Microgrids Memorandum Account MGMA among others, allow the Utility to track the costs associated with work related to disaster and wildfire response, other wildfire prevention-related costs, and certain third-party wildfire claims. While the Utility generally expects such costs to be recoverable, the CPUC may authorize the Utility to recover less than the full amount of its costs. 
 
 In recent years, the amount of the costs recorded in these accounts has increased. Because rate recovery may require CPUC authorization of the costs in these accounts, there can be a delay between when the Utility incurs costs and when it may recover those costs. As of September 30, 2024, the Utility had recorded an aggregate amount of approximately 4.1 billion in costs for the CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA, and MGMA. Of these costs, approximately 1.2 billion was authorized for recovery and accounted for as current, and 2.9 billion was accounted for as long term as of September 30, 2024. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. 
 
 If the amount of the costs recorded in these accounts continues to increase, or the delay between incurring and recovering costs lengthens, PG E Corporation and the Utility may incur additional financing costs. If the Utility does not recover the full amount of its recorded costs, the difference between the recorded and recovered amounts would be written off as a non-cash disallowance. Such disallowances could materially affect PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
 
 For more information, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1, and Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Cost Recovery Applications and Wildfire and Gas Safety Costs Recovery Application below. 
 
 26 

The Utility s cost recovery proceedings for the costs described above that are pending, have pending appeals, or were completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are summarized in the following table: 
 Proceeding Request (1)

Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Cost Recovery Applications 

2021 WMCE Application 
 
 On September 16, 2021, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of approximately 1.6 billion of recorded expenditures, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately 1.47 billion (the 2021 WMCE application ). The costs addressed in this application reflect costs related to wildfire mitigation and certain catastrophic events, as well as implementation of various customer-focused initiatives. These costs were incurred primarily in 2020. 
 
 The recorded expenditures consist of 1.4 billion in expenses and 197 million in capital expenditures. The Utility s requested revenue requirement includes amounts recorded to the VMBA of 592 million, the CEMA of 535 million, the WMBA of 149 million, and other memorandum accounts. 
 
 On August 10, 2023, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement among the Utility and intervenors pursuant to which the Utility began collecting a revenue requirement of 721 million over 24 months beginning September 1, 2023. The settlement agreement did not address the Utility s revenue requirement of 592 million associated with costs recorded to the VMBA, for which cost recovery will be determined separately by the CPUC. 
 
 On September 26, 2024, the CPUC extended the deadline to resolve the remaining issues in the proceeding to December 30, 2024. 

2022 WMCE Application 
 
 On December 15, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of approximately 1.36 billion of recorded expenditures, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately 1.29 billion (the 2022 WMCE application ). The costs addressed in this application reflect costs related to wildfire mitigation and certain catastrophic events, as well as implementation of various customer-focused initiatives. These costs were incurred primarily in 2021. 
 
 The recorded expenditures consist of 1.2 billion in expenses and 136 million in capital expenditures. On June 8, 2023, the CPUC adopted a final decision granting the Utility interim rate relief of 1.1 billion to be recovered over 12 months, which went into effect July 1, 2023. The remaining 224 million will be recovered to the extent it is approved after the CPUC issues a final decision. Cost recovery requested in this application is subject to the CPUC s reasonableness review, which could result in some or all of the interim rate relief being subject to refund. See 2022 WMCE Interim Rate Relief Subject to Refund in Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. 
 
 On December 22, 2023, the Utility filed an unopposed joint settlement with intervenors for an additional 70 million revenue requirement, which is incremental to the previously approved interim rate relief. If the CPUC adopts the settlement agreement, it would resolve all costs recorded to accounts other than the VMBA and the WMBA. The settlement agreement did not address the Utility s revenue requirement request of 916 million associated with costs recorded to the VMBA or the WMBA, for which cost recovery will be determined separately by the CPUC. 
 
 27 

On May 20, 2024, the CPUC extended the statutory deadline to resolve the remaining issues in the proceeding to December 31, 2024. 

2023 WMCE Application 
 
 On December 1, 2023, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of approximately 2.18 billion of recorded expenditures, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately 1.86 billion (the 2023 WMCE application ). The costs addressed in this application reflect costs related to wildfire mitigation and certain catastrophic events, as well as implementation of various customer-focused initiatives. These costs were incurred primarily in 2022. 
 
 The recorded expenditures consist of 1.6 billion in expenses and 559 million in capital expenditures. Of these amounts, approximately 15 of expense, or 239 million, and 30 of capital expenditures, or 167 million, relate to the Utility s response to the 2022-2023 extreme winter storms CEMA event. 
 
 On September 16, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision on interim rate recovery that grants the Utility interim rate relief of 944 million, plus interest, subject to refund, to be recovered over at least 17 months starting October 1, 2024. The remaining 914 million, plus interest, would be recovered to the extent it is approved after the CPUC issues a final decision. Cost recovery requested in this application is subject to the CPUC s reasonableness review, which could result in some or all of the interim rate relief being subject to refund. 
 
 The CPUC s procedural schedule indicates a final decision by the second quarter of 2025. 

Wildfire and Gas Safety Costs Recovery Application 
 
 On June 15, 2023, the Utility filed a WGSC application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of approximately 2.5 billion of recorded expenditures related to wildfire mitigation costs and gas safety and electric modernization costs. 
 
 The recorded expenditures for wildfire mitigation consist of 726 million in expenses and 1.5 billion in capital expenditures and cover activities during the years 2020 to 2022. The recorded expenditures for gas safety and electric modernization consist of 120 million in expenses and 118 million in capital expenditures and cover activities during the years 2017 to 2022. If approved, the requested cost recovery would result in an aggregate revenue requirement of 688 million. The costs addressed in the WGSC application are incremental to those previously authorized in the Utility s 2020 GRC and other proceedings. 
 
 The Utility recorded these costs to the memorandum and balancing accounts as set forth in the following table: 
 (in millions) Recorded Costs 
 WMPMA 
 2,095 FRMMA 
 165 Gas storage balancing account 
 101 In line inspection memorandum account 
 92 Other 
 45 Total 
 2,498 
 
 In connection with the WGSC application, the Utility also requested interim rate relief of 583 million. The remaining 105 million would be recovered after the CPUC issues a final decision. On March 7, 2024, the CPUC approved a final decision authorizing the Utility to recover 516 million in interim rates to be recovered over at least 12 months starting April 1, 2024. 
 
 The administrative law judge ALJ has adopted a schedule that would result in a proposed decision on the wildfire mitigation costs in the first half of 2025 and a final decision on the gas safety and electric modernization costs by June 2025. 
 
 28 

Forward-Looking Rate Cases 
 
 The Utility routinely participates in forward-looking rate case applications before the CPUC and the FERC. Those applications include GRCs, where the revenue required for general operations base revenue of the Utility is assessed and reset. In addition, the Utility is periodically involved in cost of capital proceedings to adjust its regulated return on rate base. The Utility s future earnings will depend on the revenue requirements authorized in such rate cases. The Utility also expects to file its SB 884 cost application with the CPUC after the OEIS approves guidelines. See SB 884 10-Year Distribution Undergrounding Program below.

2023 General Rate Case 
 
 Phase 1 
 
 On November 17, 2023, the CPUC issued a final decision on Phase 1, Tracks 1 and 2. For more information, see Regulatory Matters in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Phase 2 and Energization Timelines OIR 
 
 On September 15, 2023, the Utility served opening testimony proposing to recover energization costs incremental to the forecasts of the Utility s Phase 1 2023 GRC. Energization activities include new business connections and capacity-related work to allow for the connections and reduce energization timelines. On July 16, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision approving a memorandum account with interim rate relief, subject to annual caps and reasonableness review in the 2027 GRC application. The overall expenditure cap was set at 2.26 billion for the period of 2024 to 2026. The decision also provides the Utility the ability to request revisions to the 2025 and 2026 cap amounts under certain conditions. On October 4, 2024, the Utility filed a motion to increase the 2025 and 2026 cap amounts by an aggregate 3.1 billion, which reflects approximately 300 million originally included in 2024, for a net increase of 2.8 billion. 
 
 On October 18, 2024, the assigned commissioner issued an amended scoping memo providing for a final decision in spring 2025.

Cost of Capital Proceedings 
 
 2023 Cost of Capital Application 
 
 On December 19, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision adopting a new cost of capital including ratemaking capital structure (i.e., the relative weightings of common equity, preferred equity, and debt for ratemaking), ROE, cost of preferred stock, and cost of debt for the Utility s electric generation, electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage rate base beginning on January 1, 2023. On January 10, 2023, the CPUC issued a decision correcting certain typographical errors in the final decision. On December 14, 2023, certain intervenors filed a petition for modification requesting that the 2023 cost of capital decision be modified to, among other things, suspend application of the cost of capital adjustment mechanism pending further CPUC decision. On May 9, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision denying the petition for modification. On June 17, 2024, intervenors filed an application for rehearing of the decision denying their petition for modification. On October 18, 2024, the CPUC issued an order denying rehearing. 
 
 The 2023 cost of capital application also requested that the CPUC approve an upward adjustment above the three-month commercial paper rate for interest on the Utility s balancing and memorandum accounts to reflect the Utility s actual cost of short-term debt. The Utility requested that the adjustment be set on an annual basis effective January 1 of each year based on the average difference between the three-month commercial paper rate and the Utility s actual cost of short-term debt over the preceding twelve-month period from November through October. The decision deferred consideration of the proposal and any further changes to the cost of capital adjustment mechanism to a second phase of the proceeding. 
 
 On October 17, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision which reduced the Utility s ROE effective January 1, 2025 from 10.70 to 10.28 in conjunction with a change to the cost of capital adjustment mechanism (discussed below). As part of the updated ROE, the Utility will be allowed to update the cost of long-term debt effective January 1, 2025. Other policy changes to the cost of capital mechanism, including the Utility s request for an upward adjustment to the interest rate applicable to the Utility s balancing and memorandum accounts, were not adopted. 
 
 The Utility will file the next cost of capital application on March 20, 2025 for test year 2026. 
 
 Cost of Capital Adjustment Mechanism 
 
 The Utility s annual cost of capital adjustment mechanism provides that in any year during the applicable cost of capital period in which the difference between (i) the average Moody s Baa utility bond rates (as measured in the 12-month period from October of the prior year through September of the year in which the mechanism could trigger (the Index )) and (ii) 4.37 (based on the 2023 cost of capital decision) exceeds 100 basis points, the Utility s ROE will be adjusted by one-half of such difference, and the cost of debt will be trued up to the most recent recorded cost of debt. The Utility is to initiate this adjustment mechanism by filing an advice letter on or before October 15 of the year in which the mechanism is triggered, to become effective on January 1 of the next year. For the period from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, the Index averaged 141 basis points above the Utility s cost of capital benchmark rate of 4.37 , triggering the adjustment mechanism for the rest of the cost of capital period. 
 
 On October 13, 2023, the Utility filed an advice letter indicating that the cost of capital adjustment mechanism had been triggered and requesting to increase the Utility s ROE from 10.0 to 10.7 and its cost of long-term debt from 4.31 to 4.66 . 
 
 On December 22, 2023, the CPUC approved the Utility s advice letter. As a result, the Utility is authorized to collect a revenue requirement of 328 million, based on the 2023 GRC rate base, effective January 1, 2024. Starting on January 1, 2024, the Utility s authorized ROE increased from 10.0 to 10.7 , its authorized cost of long-term debt increased from 4.31 to 4.66 , and the benchmark has been updated to 5.78 . On January 12, 2024, several intervenors submitted a request for the CPUC to review the December 22, 2023 approval of the advice letter. On July 11, 2024, the CPUC issued a resolution confirming the approval of the advice letter. 
 
 On October 17, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision which changed the cost of capital adjustment mechanism such that the Utility s ROE will be adjusted by 20 as opposed to one-half of the difference between the average Moody s Baa utility bond rates and the benchmark rates.

Transmission Owner Rate Cases 

Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2024 (the TO21 rate case) 
 
 On October 13, 2023, the Utility filed its TO21 rate case with the FERC. In the filing, the Utility forecasts a 2024 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of 2.83 billion. The proposed amount reflects an approximately 11 decrease over the rate year 2023 retail revenue requirement of 3.18 billion, due in part to a refund to customers (see Transmission Owner Rate Case Revenue Subject to Refund in Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1) and the transaction to lease entitlements associated with certain transmission assets (see Liquidity and Financial Resources - Other Financings above). The Utility made investments of approximately 1.22 billion in 2023 and forecasts that it will make investments of approximately 1.43 billion in 2024 for various capital projects to be placed in service before the end of 2024. The Utility has requested that FERC approve a 12.37 base ROE as well as a 0.5 adder for its participation in the CAISO. The TO21 filing also addresses the Utility s capital structure and several new issues including wildfire self-insurance recovery from transmission customers. On December 29, 2023, the FERC issued an order accepting the TO21 filing subject to refund, establishing a January 1, 2024 effective date, and establishing a settlement and hearing process, but denying the 0.5 ROE adder for participation in the CAISO, which results in a forecast transmission revenue requirement of 2.78 billion. On January 29, 2024, the Utility filed a request for rehearing of the FERC s denial of the 0.5 ROE adder for participation in the CAISO. On February 29, 2024, the FERC issued a notice of denial of rehearing by operation of law. FERC s denial indicated that substantive issues related to rehearing will be addressed in a future order. On June 12, 2024, the FERC issued an order denying the Utility s request for rehearing. On June 18, 2024, the Utility and California IOUs filed an appeal of the FERC s order denying the Utility s request for rehearing. The utilities joint opening brief was filed on September 11, 2024. 

Other Regulatory Proceedings 

2020-2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plans 
 
 On February 26, 2023, the OEIS issued its final Annual Report on Compliance ARC for the Utility s 2020 WMP. In the final ARC, the OEIS found that the Utility undertook significant efforts to reduce its wildfire risk and, in many instances, achieved its stated objectives and targets, but did not substantially comply with the WMP during the 2020 compliance period. On March 24, 2023, the Utility filed a writ in the California Superior Court seeking judicial review of the OEIS ARC on the grounds that the OEIS failed to utilize the compliance evaluation criteria adopted by the CPUC. On June 11, 2024, the Utility and the OEIS entered into a settlement agreement, pursuant to which the Utility dismissed the writ and the OEIS agreed not to recommend that the CPUC pursue an enforcement action against the Utility or impose penalties. On July 10, 2024, enforcement staff of the CPUC determined that the Utility had remediated the defects in the ARC and that no further action was required. 

2023-2025 Wildfire Mitigation Plan 
 
 On March 27, 2023, the Utility submitted the 2023-2025 WMP. The 2023-2025 WMP addresses the Utility s wildfire safety programs and initiatives focused on reducing the potential for catastrophic wildfires related to electrical equipment and reducing the customer impact of EPSS and PSPS events. On December 29, 2023, the OEIS issued a final decision approving the Utility s 2023-2025 WMP. On February 15, 2024, the CPUC ratified the OEIS s approval. On January 8, 2024, the Utility filed a change order request to reflect spend amounts approved in the 2023 GRC final decision. On May 31, 2024, the OEIS issued a decision approving in part and denying in part the change order request. 
 
 The Utility submitted an updated 2025 WMP on April 2, 2024, as directed by the OEIS. On August 29, 2024, the OEIS issued a draft approval of the Utility s 2025 WMP update. 

Application with Pacific Generation for Approval to Transfer Non-Nuclear Generation Assets 
 
 On September 28, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC regarding the separation of the Utility s non-nuclear generation assets into a newly formed, stand-alone Utility subsidiary, Pacific Generation. The application, which was filed jointly with Pacific Generation, sought to establish Pacific Generation as a separate, rate-regulated utility subject to regulation by the CPUC and contemplated the potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation to one or more investors to be identified. On May 10, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision denying the application. 
 
 31 

Self-Reports to the CPUC 
 
 The Utility self-reports potential violations of certain requirements to the CPUC. The Utility could face penalties, enforcement actions, or other adverse legal or regulatory consequences for these potential violations, including under the EOEP. For more information about the EOEP, see PG E Corporation and the Utility are subject to the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K. The Utility is unable to predict the likelihood and the amount of potential fines or penalties, if any, related to these matters. 
 
 Electric Asset Inspections 
 
 The Utility has notified the CPUC of various errors relating to inspections and maintenance of its electric assets or implementation of WMP initiatives. These notices include missed inspections or the inability to locate records evidencing performance of inspections required under CPUC GOs 95 and 165 and errors regarding reporting meeting targets set by the Utility s WMP. In these notices, the Utility describes the failures and corrective actions the Utility is taking to remediate these issues and to prevent recurrence. Among other corrective measures, the Utility has developed short-term and longer-term systemic corrective actions to address these errors, including performing enhanced inspections for poles with outdated or incomplete GO 165 inspection records and strengthening the Utility s asset registry, as well as corrective actions regarding reporting on the progress toward WMP targets. 
 
 On October 26, 2022, the Utility notified the CPUC that the Utility s procedure for wood pole replacements did not comply with CPUC requirements for replacement of poles under certain conditions and, in some instances, the Utility failed to replace wood poles with safety factors below the required minimum. Among other short- and longer-term corrective measures, the Utility is replacing identified poles on a risk prioritized basis and revising its wood pole replacement procedures in alignment with CPUC requirements. Since December 22, 2022, on an ongoing basis, the Utility submits updates to the CPUC regarding a population of wood poles that had not received intrusive inspections in accordance with GO 165 s deadlines due to legacy issues. 
 
 The Utility continues to evaluate whether there are additional failures to comply with GO 95 and 165, beyond those identified in submitted self-reports. The Utility intends to update the CPUC upon completion of its reviews and to address any issues it identifies. 

Extension of Diablo Canyon Operations 
 
 On September 2, 2022, SB 846 became law. SB 846 supports the extension of operations at Diablo Canyon through no later than 2030, with the potential for an earlier retirement date. Under the legislation, the Utility would continue to operate Diablo Canyon on behalf of all CPUC-jurisdictional load serving entities LSEs ), and all customers of those LSEs would be responsible for the cost of extended operations. 
 
 The key steps to continued operations are NRC license renewal and approvals from California state agencies, including the CPUC, California Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, California State Lands Commission, California Coastal Commission, and other state agencies. In 2023, the Utility received approvals from the CPUC, California Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, California State Lands Commission, and California State Water Resources Control Board. 
 
 On November 7, 2023, the Utility submitted an application for license renewal with the NRC. On December 19, 2023, the NRC deemed the application sufficient, which allows continued operations at Diablo Canyon past the plant s current licenses. The NRC s schedule indicates that it will issue a final safety evaluation report and supplemental environmental impact statement by June 2025. 
 
 On March 29, 2024, the Utility submitted an application for net recovery through rates of approximately 418 million of costs associated with extended operations at Diablo Canyon for the period from 2023 through 2025. On October 11, 2024, the Utility updated its testimony and net recovery request to reflect updated market conditions closer to the time when rates go into effect. The resulting updated net recovery request is approximately 761 million. The request represents approximately 1.36 billion of forecasted expenditures and collectible revenues, offset by forecasted market revenues of approximately 624 million, and incorporating certain fees for the final net recovery amount. 
 
 32 

Application for Third AB 1054 Securitization Transaction 
 
 AB 1054 provides that the first 5.0 billion expended in the aggregate by California s three large electric IOUs on fire risk mitigation capital expenditures included in their respective approved WMPs will be excluded from their respective equity rate bases. The 5.0 billion of capital expenditures has been allocated among the large electric IOUs in accordance with their Wildfire Fund allocation metrics. The Utility s allocation is 3.21 billion. 
 
 On August 10, 2023, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a third transaction to use securitization to finance the recovery of up to 1.38 billion of fire risk mitigation capital expenditure amounts that have been or would be incurred by the Utility from August 1, 2019 through the second quarter of 2024. The final amount to be financed using securitization would be based on actual recorded and authorized capital expenditures incurred by the Utility prior to the securitization transaction and not to exceed the remaining 1.38 billion of the Utility s AB 1054 allocation. 
 
 The application requested that the CPUC issue a financing order authorizing one or more series of recovery bonds, determine that the issuance of the bonds and collection through fixed recovery charges is just and reasonable, consistent with the public interest, would reduce rates on a present-value basis compared to traditional utility financing mechanisms, and authorize the Utility to collect a non-bypassable charge sufficient to pay debt service on the recovery bonds. 
 
 On February 16, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the Utility s application. On August 1, 2024, PG E Recovery Funding LLC issued approximately 1.42 billion of Series 2024-A senior secured recovery bonds. 
 
 See Liquidity and Financial Resources above. 

SB 884 10-Year Distribution Undergrounding Program 
 
 On March 7, 2024, the CPUC approved a resolution that establishes an expedited utility distribution infrastructure undergrounding program pursuant to Public Utilities Code Section 8388.5. The resolution addresses the process and requirements for the CPUC s review of any large electrical corporation s 10-year distribution infrastructure undergrounding plan and conditional approval of its related costs. 
 
 The OEIS issued draft guidelines on May 8, 2024 and revised guidelines on September 10, 2024. The Utility anticipates that the OEIS will issue final guidelines in 2024. 
 
 The Utility expects to submit its undergrounding plan to the OEIS after final guidelines are issued before submitting its cost application to the CPUC, as directed in Public Utilities Code Section 8388.5. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 
 The Utility s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of the Utility s personnel and the public. These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility s activities, including the remediation of hazardous substances; the reporting and reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting of safety and reliability measures for natural gas storage facilities; and the transportation, handling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1: 
 
 segment). 
 
 The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the interim period reporting requirements of Form 10-Q and reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. The information as of December 31, 2023 in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q was derived from the audited Consolidated Balance Sheets in Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K. This quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions relate to the Utility s regulatory assets and liabilities, wildfire-related liabilities, legal and regulatory contingencies, the Wildfire Fund, environmental remediation liabilities, asset retirement obligations, wildfire-related receivables, and pension and other post-retirement benefit plan obligations. Management believes that its estimates and assumptions reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate and reasonable. A change in management s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that would have a material impact on PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows during the period in which such change occurred.

million and million were recorded in Operating and maintenance expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for credit losses associated with trade and other receivables during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, expected credit losses were million and million, respectively. The portion of expected credit losses that are deemed probable of recovery are deferred to the RUBA and a FERC regulatory asset account. As of September 30, 2024, the RUBA current balancing accounts and FERC noncurrent regulatory asset balances were million and million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the RUBA current balancing accounts and FERC noncurrent regulatory asset balances were million and million, respectively. The RUBA current balancing account balance decreased from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily due to the annual electric and gas true-up which allows the Utility to recover approximately million in undercollections from residential customers in 2024. 
 
 Other Receivables and Available-For-Sale Debt Securities 
 
 Insurance receivables are related to the liability insurance policies PG E Corporation and the Utility carry. Insurance receivable risk is related to each insurance carrier s risk of defaulting on their individual policies. Wildfire Fund receivables are the funds available from the statewide fund established under AB 1054 for payment of eligible claims related to the 2021 Dixie fire that exceed 1.0 billion and available insurance coverage. For more information, see Note 10 below. Wildfire Fund receivables risk is related to the Wildfire Fund s durability, which is a measurement of its claim-paying capacity. Lastly, PG E Corporation and the Utility are required to determine if the fair value is below the amortized cost basis for their available-for-sale debt securities (i.e., impairment). If such an impairment exists and does not otherwise result in a write-down, then PG E Corporation and the Utility must determine whether a portion of the impairment is a result of expected credit loss. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, expected credit losses for insurance receivables, Wildfire Fund receivables, and available-for-sale debt securities were immaterial. 

million recorded as a deduction to Cost of electricity for income related to government grants for incurred eligible costs to purchase nuclear fuel. 
 
 DWR Loan Agreement 
 
 On October 18, 2022, the DWR and the Utility executed a billion loan agreement to support the extension of Diablo Canyon, up to approximately billion of which could be repaid by funds received from the DOE (see U.S. DOE s Civil Nuclear Credit Program below). Under the loan agreement, the DWR pays the Utility a monthly performance-based disbursement equal to for each MWh generated by Diablo Canyon, effective September 2, 2022. The Utility may use the proceeds of the performance-based disbursements for any business purpose, except as profits or dividends to shareholders or as otherwise prohibited by SB 846. The Utility began earning performance-based disbursements beginning on September 2, 2022 and is eligible to earn performance-based disbursements until the previously-approved retirement dates for Diablo Canyon Unit 1 and Unit 2 (2024 and 2025, respectively). The performance-based disbursements are contingent upon the Utility s ongoing efforts to pursue extension of and continued safe and reliable operation of Diablo Canyon. The aggregate amount of performance-based disbursements under this agreement will not exceed million.

The Utility will use these funds to repay its loans outstanding under the DWR Loan Agreement (see DWR Loan Agreement above). Final award amounts will be determined following completion of each year of the award period, and amounts awarded over a four-year award period ending in 2026 will be based on a number of factors, including actual costs incurred to extend the Diablo Canyon operations. When there is reasonable assurance that the Utility will receive funding and comply with the conditions of the DOE s Civil Nuclear Credit Program, the Utility will recognize such funding as income and will record a receivable related to government grants. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income reflected million and million, respectively, as a deduction to Operating and maintenance expense , for income related to government grants for incurred eligible costs to support the extension of Diablo Canyon. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income reflected million and million, respectively, as a deduction to Operating and maintenance expense for income related to government grants for incurred eligible costs to support the extension of Diablo Canyon.

rentable square feet of space within the Lakeside Building, which serves as the Utility s principal administrative headquarters. 
 
 BA2 300 Lakeside LLC is considered a VIE because the group that holds the equity investment at risk lacks the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity due to a fixed-price purchase option covering more than 50 of the fair value of the assets held by the entity. The most significant activities that impact the economic performance of BA2 300 Lakeside LLC are decisions related to significant maintenance and remarketing of the property. The Utility is not considered the primary beneficiary and does not consolidate BA2 300 Lakeside LLC as it does not have any decision-making rights associated with these activities. The Utility s financial obligation is limited to the issued letter of credit as well as the amounts it pays for base rent and certain costs, per the office lease agreement.

 AB 1054 Securitization 
 
 AB 1054 provides that certain capital expenditures may be financed using a structure that securitizes a dedicated customer charge. On August 10, 2023, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a third transaction to use securitization to finance the recovery of up to billion of fire risk mitigation capital expenditure amounts that have been or would be incurred by the Utility from August 1, 2019 through the second quarter of 2024. The final amount to be financed using securitization would be based on actual recorded and authorized capital expenditures incurred by the Utility prior to the securitization transaction and not to exceed the remaining billion of the Utility s AB 1054 allocation. 
 
 The application requested that the CPUC issue a financing order authorizing one or more series of recovery bonds, determine that the issuance of the bonds and collection through fixed recovery charges is just and reasonable, consistent with the public interest, would reduce rates on a present-value basis compared to traditional utility financing mechanisms, and authorize the Utility to collect a non-bypassable charge sufficient to pay debt service on the recovery bonds.

acres and resulted in fatalities, first responder injuries, structures destroyed, and structures damaged. In connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, state and local officials issued numerous mandatory evacuation orders and evacuation warnings. Based on County of Sonoma information, PG E Corporation and the Utility understand that the geographic zones subject to either a mandatory evacuation order or an evacuation warning between October 23, 2019 and November 4, 2019 included approximately persons. 
 
 On July 16, 2020, Cal Fire issued a press release with its determination that the Utility s equipment caused the 2019 Kincade fire. 
 
 As of October 30, 2024, PG E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately complaints on behalf of at least plaintiffs related to the 2019 Kincade fire. The plaintiffs filed master complaints on July 16, 2021; PG E Corporation s and the Utility s response was filed on August 16, 2021; and PG E Corporation and the Utility filed a demurrer with respect to the plaintiffs inverse condemnation claims. On December 10, 2021, the court overruled the demurrer. On July 20, 2022, PG E Corporation and the Utility filed a motion for summary adjudication on individual plaintiffs claims for punitive damages. On July 14, 2024 the court vacated the bellwether trial date that had been scheduled for August 26, 2024, as well as the hearing on the motion for summary adjudication. The court has also scheduled a damages-only trial for a single claim for February 3, 2025. PG E Corporation and the Utility are also aware of a complaint on behalf of Geysers Power Company, Calpine Corporation, and CPN Insurance Corporation. The court has scheduled a trial on their claims for August 4, 2025. 
 
 In addition, on January 5, 2022, Cal Fire filed a complaint against the Utility in the coordinated proceeding seeking to recover approximately million for fire suppression and other costs incurred in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire. The Utility filed an answer to Cal Fire s complaint on February 4, 2022. On August 8, 2023, PG E Corporation and the Utility entered into an agreement with Cal Fire to resolve its claims arising from the 2019 Kincade fire. On January 24, 2024, Cal Fire filed a request to dismiss its complaint with prejudice in the coordinated proceeding, which the court entered. 
 
 On October 11, 2022, the Utility entered into a tolling agreement with the California Governor s Office of Emergency Services Cal OES ), which remains in effect. 
 
 Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG E Corporation s and the Utility s investigation, PG E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire. PG E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of billion as of December 31, 2023 (before available insurance). Based on the facts and circumstances available to PG E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including their experience with settlements, PG E Corporation and the Utility recorded an additional charge in the third quarter of 2024 for probable losses in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire of million for an aggregate liability of billion (before available insurance).

 Accrued Losses Payments ) Balance at September 30, 2024 

The Utility has liability insurance coverage for third-party liability attributable to the 2019 Kincade fire in an aggregate amount of million, which was fully collected as of December 31, 2023. 

acres and resulted in structures destroyed and structures damaged (including residential homes, multi-family homes, commercial residential homes, nonresidential commercial structures, and detached structures), and first-responder injuries. The Cal Fire Investigation Report does not attribute a fatality that was previously published in an October 25, 2021 Cal Fire incident report to the 2021 Dixie fire. 
 
 On January 4, 2022, Cal Fire issued a press release with its determination that the 2021 Dixie fire was caused by a tree contacting electrical distribution lines owned and operated by the Utility. On June 7, 2022, the Utility received a copy of the Cal Fire Investigation Report, which states that the fire ignited when a tree fell and contacted electrical distribution lines owned and operated by the Utility, and the Cal Fire Investigation Report has been made publicly available. The Cal Fire Investigation Report alleges that the Utility acted negligently in its response to the initial outage and fault that caused the 2021 Dixie fire. The Cal Fire Investigation Report also alleges that the subject tree had visible outward signs of damage and decay which would have been noticeable at the ground level, and that a brief visual inspection should have discovered the decay. Based on the information currently available to the Utility, through its ongoing investigation, including its inspection records, operating and inspection protocols and procedures, implementation of those protocols and procedures, and day-of-event response, the Utility believes its personnel acted reasonably (within the meaning of the applicable prudency standard discussed under Regulatory Recovery below) given the information available at the time and followed applicable policies and protocols both before ignition and in the day-of-event response. While an intervenor in a future cost recovery proceeding may argue the Cal Fire Investigation Report itself creates serious doubt with respect to the reasonableness of the Utility s conduct, PG E Corporation and the Utility do not believe the report identifies sufficient facts to shift the burden of proof applicable in a proceeding for cost recovery to the Utility. (See Regulatory Recovery and Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 below.) PG E Corporation and the Utility disagree with many allegations in the Cal Fire Investigation Report and plan to vigorously contest them. However, if the CPUC or the FERC were to reach conclusions similar to those of the Cal Fire Investigation Report, it may determine that the Utility had been imprudent, in which case some or all of its costs recorded to the WEMA would not be recoverable, the Utility would not be able to recover costs through FERC TO rates, or the Utility would be required to reimburse the Wildfire Fund for the costs and expenses that are allocated to it.

million to California s General Fund; (ii) pay million to tribes impacted by the 2021 Dixie fire; (iii) and undertake an initiative to transition to electronic records for specified patrols and inspections of distribution facilities, at an approximate cost of million over , and the Utility may not seek recovery of such costs. The SED agreed to refrain from instituting any further enforcement proceedings against the Utility related to the 2021 Dixie fire. The Dixie ACO states that it does not constitute an admission or evidence of any wrongdoing, fault, omission, negligence, imprudence, or liability on the part of the Utility. The Dixie ACO also states that the parties to it intend that it shall not affect whether the Utility may obtain recovery of costs and expenses incurred in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire, including for amounts drawn from the Wildfire Fund or otherwise sought through a cost recovery application to the CPUC. On February 2, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the Dixie ACO. In connection with the Dixie ACO, PG E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability of million reflected in Other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024. For the recordkeeping initiative costs for which the Utility will not seek recovery, the Utility expects to record disallowances as such costs are incurred. 
 
 As of October 30, 2024, PG E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately complaints on behalf of at least individual plaintiffs related to the 2021 Dixie fire and expect that they may receive further complaints. The plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, property damage, economic loss, medical monitoring, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys fees and other damages. The court had previously scheduled two trial dates for October 14, 2024 and February 24, 2025. The Court has vacated both of those dates and set a new bellwether trial date for June 23, 2025. 
 
 PG E Corporation and the Utility are also aware of a complaint on behalf of the Collins Pine Company and a group of timber companies, and a complaint filed by Cal Fire to recover suppression and investigation costs. 
 
 PG E Corporation and the Utility are aware of a separate putative class complaint. On August 23, 2024, PG E Corporation and the Utility demurred to the putative class complaint. The hearing on that motion is set for December 20, 2024. 
 
 Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG E Corporation s and the Utility s investigation, PG E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire. PG E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of billion as of December 31, 2023 (before available insurance). Based on the facts and circumstances available to PG E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including their experience with settlements, PG E Corporation and the Utility recorded an additional charge in the third quarter of 2024 for probable losses in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire of million for an aggregate liability of billion (before available insurance). 
 
 PG E Corporation s and the Utility s accrued estimated losses of billion do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies including for state or federal fire suppression costs and damages related to federal land, (iv) medical monitoring costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable. 
 
 As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs from federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests. As to these damages, PG E Corporation and the Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable. PG E Corporation and the Utility are unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for any such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on the amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2021 Dixie fire. PG E Corporation and the Utility believe, however, that such losses could be significant with respect to fire suppression costs due to the size and duration of the 2021 Dixie fire and corresponding magnitude of fire suppression resources dedicated to fighting the 2021 Dixie fire and with respect to claims for damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests due to the very large number of acres of national parks and national forests that were affected by the 2021 Dixie fire. According to the Cal Fire Investigation Report, over million of costs had been incurred in suppressing the 2021 Dixie fire. The Utility estimates that the fire burned approximately acres of national parks and approximately acres of national forests.

Accrued Losses Payments ) Balance at September 30, 2024 

As of September 30, 2024, the Utility recorded an insurance receivable of million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire. 
 
 The Utility recorded an aggregate Wildfire Fund receivable of million for probable recoveries in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire, of which it had received million as of September 30, 2024. AB 1054 provides that the CPUC may allocate costs and expenses in the application for cost recovery in full or in part taking into account factors both within and beyond the utility s control that may have exacerbated the costs and expenses, including humidity, temperature, and winds. PG E Corporation and the Utility believe that, even if it found that the Utility acted unreasonably, the CPUC would nevertheless authorize recovery in part. See Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 below. As of September 30, 2024, the Utility also recorded a million reduction to its regulatory liability for wildfire-related claims costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through the FERC TO formula rate and a million regulatory asset for costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through the WEMA. See Regulatory Recovery below. Decreases in the amount of the insurance receivable for the 2021 Dixie fire may also increase the amount that is probable of recovery through the FERC TO formula rate and the WEMA. 

acres at that time. It also indicated fatalities, injuries, structures destroyed, and structures damaged (including residential homes and detached structures) and that the fire was contained. 
 
 The USFS has indicated to the Utility an initial assessment that the fire started in the area of the Utility s power line on National Forest System lands and that the USFS is conducting a criminal investigation into the 2022 Mosquito fire. On September 24, 2022, the USFS removed and took possession of one of the Utility s transmission poles and attached equipment. The USFS has not issued a determination as to the cause. 
 
 The cause of the 2022 Mosquito fire remains under investigation by the USFS and the United States Department of Justice, and PG E Corporation and the Utility are cooperating with the investigation. It is uncertain when any such investigations will be complete. PG E Corporation and the Utility are also conducting their own investigation into the cause of the 2022 Mosquito fire. This investigation is ongoing. 
 
 The CPUC is investigating the 2022 Mosquito fire, and other entities may also be investigating. It is uncertain when any such investigations will be complete. 
 
 As of October 30, 2024, PG E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately complaints on behalf of at least individual plaintiffs related to the 2022 Mosquito fire and expect that they may receive further complaints. PG E Corporation and the Utility also are aware of a complaint on behalf of the Placer County Water Agency PCWA ), a complaint on behalf of the Middle Fork Project Finance Authority, and complaints on behalf of six public entities. The plaintiffs seek damages that include property damage, economic loss, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys fees and other damages. On April 24, 2024, PG E Corporation and the Utility filed cross-complaints against PCWA, alleging that conduct by PCWA was a substantial cause of the 2022 Mosquito fire. The cross-complaints seek property damages, indemnification, attorneys fees, and other damages. 
 
 77 

million as of December 31, 2023 (before available insurance). The aggregate liability remained unchanged as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 PG E Corporation s and the Utility s accrued estimated losses do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies including for state or federal fire suppression costs and damages related to federal land, or (iv) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable. 
 
 As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2022 Mosquito fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs from federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests. As to these damages, PG E Corporation and the Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable. PG E Corporation and the Utility are unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for any such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on the amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2022 Mosquito fire. 
 
 The following table presents changes in the lower end of the range of PG E Corporation s and the Utility s reasonably estimable losses, net of payments, for claims arising from the 2022 Mosquito fire since December 31, 2023. 
 Accrued Losses Payments Balance at September 30, 2024 

As of September 30, 2024, the Utility recorded an insurance receivable of million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2022 Mosquito fire, including legal fees. As of September 30, 2024, the Utility also recorded a million reduction to its regulatory liability for wildfire-related claims costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through the FERC TO formula rate and a million regulatory asset for costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through the WEMA.

billion for 2024. This disallowance cap is based on the equity portion of the Utility s forecasted weighted-average 2024 electric transmission and distribution rate base, which is subject to adjustment based on changes in the Utility s electric transmission and distribution rate base. The disallowance cap is inapplicable in certain circumstances, including if the Wildfire Fund administrator determines that the electric utility company s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted conscious or willful disregard for the rights and safety of others, or the electric utility company failed to maintain a valid safety certification. Costs that the CPUC determines to be just and reasonable in accordance with the prudency standard in AB 1054 will not be reimbursed to the Wildfire Fund, resulting in a draw-down of the Wildfire Fund. 
 
 Before the expiration of any current safety certification, the Utility must request a new safety certification from the OEIS, which the Utility expects to be issued within days if the Utility has provided documentation that it has satisfied the requirements for the safety certification pursuant to Section 8389(e) of the Public Utilities Code, added by AB 1054. An issued safety certification is valid for months or until a timely request for a new safety certification is acted upon, whichever occurs later. The safety certification is separate from the CPUC s enforcement authority and does not preclude the CPUC from pursuing remedies for safety or other applicable violations. On January 22, 2024, the OEIS approved the Utility s 2023 application and issued the Utility s 2023 safety certification. 
 
 The Wildfire Fund and disallowance cap will be terminated when the amounts therein are exhausted. The Wildfire Fund is expected to be capitalized with (i) billion collected through a extension of the DWR charge to customers, (ii) billion in initial contributions from California s three large electric IOUs and (iii) million in annual contributions paid by the participating electric IOUs for a period. 
 
 The Wildfire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund. Such funds could be depleted more quickly than expected, including as a result of claims made by California s other participating electric utility companies. The Wildfire Fund is available to pay for the Utility s eligible claims arising as of July 12, 2019, the effective date of AB 1054, subject to a limit of 40 of the allowed amount of such claims arising between the effective date of AB 1054 and the Utility s emergence from Chapter 11. The 40 limit does not apply to eligible claims that arise after the Utility s emergence from Chapter 11. AB 1054 authorizes the reimbursement of funds where a participating utility has demonstrated that it exercised reasonable business judgment in the valuation and payment of third-party claims.

 million, which represents its best estimate of probable losses for the Wildfire-Related Securities Claims. PG E Corporation believes that it is reasonably possible that the amount of loss could be greater or less than the accrued estimated amount due to the number of plaintiffs and the complexity of the litigation, and because a class settlement, if any, would be subject to, among other things, approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the District Court, and class members would have the right to opt out of any such settlement. 

purported securities class actions were filed in the District Court, naming PG E Corporation and certain of its former officers as defendants, entitled David C. Weston v. PG E Corporation, et al. and Jon Paul Moretti v. PG E Corporation, et al. , respectively. The complaints alleged material misrepresentations and omissions in various PG E Corporation public disclosures related to, among other things, vegetation management and other issues connected to the 2017 Northern California wildfires. The complaints asserted claims under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and sought unspecified monetary relief, interest, attorneys fees and other costs. Both complaints identified a proposed class period of April 29, 2015 to June 8, 2018. On September 10, 2018, the court consolidated both cases, and the litigation is now denominated In re PG E Corporation Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Case No. 18-03509. The court also appointed PERA as lead plaintiff. PERA filed a consolidated amended complaint on November 9, 2018. On December 14, 2018, PERA filed a second amended consolidated complaint to add allegations regarding the 2018 Camp fire, including allegations regarding transmission line safety and the PSPS program. 
 
 Due to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the proceedings were automatically stayed as to PG E Corporation and the Utility. 
 
 On February 22, 2019, a third purported securities class action was filed in the District Court, entitled York County on behalf of the York County Retirement Fund, et al. v. Rambo, et al. (the York County Action ). The complaint named as defendants certain former officers and directors, as well as the underwriters of public offerings of notes from 2016 to 2018. Neither PG E Corporation nor the Utility was named as a defendant. The complaint asserted claims under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, based on alleged material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the note offerings related to, among other things, PG E Corporation s and the Utility s vegetation management and wildfire safety measures. On May 7, 2019, the York County Action was consolidated with In re PG E Corporation Securities Litigation.

 On January 25, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order to approve procedures to help facilitate the resolution of the Subordinated Claims. The order, among other things, established procedures allowing PG E Corporation and the Utility to collect trading information with respect to the Subordinated Claims, to engage in an alternative dispute resolution process for resolving disputed Subordinated Claims, and to file certain omnibus claim objections with respect to the Subordinated Claims. 
 
 PG E Corporation and the Utility have worked to resolve the Subordinated Claims in accordance with procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court, including by collecting trading information from holders of Subordinated Claims. Also, pursuant to those procedures, PG E Corporation and the Utility have filed numerous omnibus objections in the Bankruptcy Court to certain of the Subordinated Claims. The Bankruptcy Court has entered several orders disallowing and expunging Subordinated Claims that were subject to these omnibus objections, and certain Subordinated Claims subject to these omnibus objections remain pending. PG E Corporation and the Utility expect to continue to prosecute omnibus objections with respect to certain of the Subordinated Claims and act under the procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court to resolve the Subordinated Claims.

The costs addressed in this application reflect costs related to wildfire mitigation and certain catastrophic events, as well as the implementation of various customer-focused initiatives. These costs were incurred primarily in 2021. 
 
 The recorded expenditures consist of billion in expenses and million in capital expenditures. On June 8, 2023, the CPUC adopted a final decision granting the Utility interim rate relief of billion to be recovered over 12 months, which went into effect July 1, 2023. The remaining million will be recovered to the extent it is approved after the CPUC issues a final decision. Cost recovery requested in this application is subject to the CPUC s reasonableness review, which could result in some or all of the interim rate relief being subject to refund. 
 
 On May 20, 2024, the CPUC extended the statutory deadline to resolve the remaining issues in the proceeding to December 31, 2024.

billion of recorded expenditures related to wildfire mitigation costs and gas safety and electric modernization costs. 
 
 The recorded expenditures for wildfire mitigation consist of million in expenses and billion in capital expenditures and cover activities during the years 2020 to 2022. The recorded expenditures for gas safety and electric modernization consist of million in expenses and million in capital expenditures and cover activities during the years 2017 to 2022. If approved, the requested cost recovery would result in an aggregate revenue requirement of million. The costs addressed in the WGSC application are incremental to those previously authorized in the Utility s 2020 GRC and other proceedings. 
 
 On March 7, 2024, the CPUC approved a final decision authorizing the Utility to recover million in interim rates to be recovered over at least 12 months starting April 1, 2024. The remaining million will be recovered to the extent it is approved after the CPUC issues a final decision. Cost recovery requested in this application is subject to the CPUC s reasonableness review, which could result in some or all of the interim rate relief being subject to refund. 
 
 The ALJ has adopted a schedule that would result in a proposed decision on the wildfire mitigation costs in the first half of 2025 and a final decision on the gas safety and electric modernization costs by June 2025. 

million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These amounts were included in Other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Included among these claims and lawsuits are the proofs of claim filed in the Chapter 11 Cases, except for proofs of claim discussed under Wildfire-Related Securities Claims Claims in the Bankruptcy Court Process in Note 10. PG E Corporation and the Utility have resolved a significant majority of the proofs of claim. PG E Corporation and the Utility continue their review and analysis of certain remaining claims. PG E Corporation and the Utility do not believe it is reasonably possible that the resolution of these matters will have a material impact on their financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

million in costs for gas transmission and distribution lines, which the CPUC did not allow the Utility to recover through rates, and million in customer bill credits, in connection with its decision issued in 2015 for the San Bruno natural gas explosion in September of 2010. PG E Corporation records an income tax benefit related to a deduction for an uncertain tax position when it determines it is more likely than not that the uncertain tax position will ultimately be sustained. On June 4, 2024, the Office of Chief Counsel of the IRS issued a technical advice memorandum taking the position that the costs the Utility incurred for gas transmission and distribution lines and customer bill credits are nondeductible fines or penalties. As a result, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, PG E Corporation had determined that it is no longer more likely than not that its deduction related to a portion of the customer bill credits would ultimately be sustained. Accordingly, PG E Corporation has decreased its Income tax benefit by million as of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to state and federal income taxes. PG E Corporation intends to defend itself vigorously as to all costs in this matter.

Hinkley natural gas compressor station Former MGP sites owned by the Utility or third parties (1) 
 Utility-owned generation facilities (other than fossil fuel-fired), other facilities, and third-party disposal sites (2) 
 Fossil fuel-fired generation facilities and sites (3) 
 Total environmental remediation liability 
 (1) Primarily driven by the following sites: San Francisco Beach Street, Napa, and San Francisco East Harbor. 
 (2) Primarily driven by geothermal landfill and Shell Pond site. 
 (3) Primarily driven by the San Francisco Potrero Power Plant. 
 
 The Utility s gas compressor stations, former MGP sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, and disposal of potentially hazardous substances are subject to requirements issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in addition to other state laws relating to hazardous substances. The Utility has a comprehensive program to comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to hazardous materials, waste, remediation activities, and other environmental requirements. The Utility assesses and monitors the environmental requirements on an ongoing basis and implements changes to its program as deemed appropriate. The Utility s remediation activities are overseen by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control DTSC ), several California regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies. 
 
 The Utility s environmental remediation liability as of September 30, 2024, reflects its best estimate of probable future costs for remediation based on the current assessment data and regulatory obligations. Future costs will depend on many factors, including the extent of work necessary to implement final remediation plans, the Utility s time frame for remediation, and unanticipated claims filed against the Utility. The Utility may incur actual costs in the future that are materially different than this estimate and such costs could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows during the period in which they are recorded. As of September 30, 2024, the Utility expected to recover billion of its environmental remediation liability for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms authorized by the CPUC. 
 
 Natural Gas Compressor Station Sites 
 
 The Utility is legally responsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility s natural gas compressor stations. The Utility is also required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment. 
 
 86 

million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental remediation at the Topock site are expected to be recovered primarily through the HSMA, where of the costs are recovered through rates. 
 
 Hinkley Site 
 
 The Utility s remediation and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region. In November 2015, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region adopted a clean-up and abatement order directing the Utility to contain and remediate the underground plume of hexavalent chromium and the potential environmental impacts. The final order states that the Utility must continue and improve its remediation efforts, define the boundaries of the chromium plume, and take action to meet interim cleanup targets. It is reasonably possible that the Utility s undiscounted future costs associated with the Hinkley site may increase by as much as million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental remediation at the Hinkley site will not be recovered through rates. 
 
 Former Manufactured Gas Plants 
 
 Former MGPs used coal and oil to produce gas for use by the Utility s customers before natural gas became available. The by-products and residues of this process were often disposed of at the MGPs themselves. The Utility has a program to manage the residues left behind as a result of the manufacturing process; many of the sites in the program have been addressed. It is reasonably possible that the Utility s undiscounted future costs associated with MGP sites may increase by as much as million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation at identified MGP sites is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental remediation at the MGP sites are recovered through the HSMA, where of the costs are recovered through rates. 
 
 Utility-Owned Generation Facilities and Third-Party Disposal Sites 
 
 Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites often involve long-term remediation. It is reasonably possible that the Utility s undiscounted future costs associated with Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites may increase by as much as million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The environmental remediation costs associated with the Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites are recovered through the HSMA, where of the costs are recovered through rates. 
 
 Fossil Fuel-Fired Generation Sites 
 
 In 1998, the Utility divested its generation power plant business as part of generation deregulation. Although the Utility sold its fossil-fueled power plants, the Utility retained the environmental remediation liability associated with each site. It is reasonably possible that the Utility s undiscounted future costs associated with fossil fuel-fired generation sites may increase by as much as million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The environmental remediation costs associated with the fossil fuel-fired sites will not be recovered through rates. 

nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the Humboldt Bay independent spent fuel storage installation.

billion per nuclear incident and billion per non-nuclear incident for Diablo Canyon. For the Humboldt Bay independent spent fuel storage installation, NEIL provides up to million of coverage for nuclear and non-nuclear property damages. NEIL also provides coverage for damages caused by acts of terrorism and cyberattacks at nuclear power plants. Through NEIL, there is up to billion available to the membership to cover this exposure. These coverage amounts are shared by all NEIL members and all nuclear and non-nuclear property insurance policies issued by NEIL. EMANI shares losses with NEIL, as part of the first million of coverage within the current nuclear insurance program. EMANI also provides an additional million in excess insurance for property damage and business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur at Diablo Canyon. If NEIL losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment. If NEIL were to exercise this assessment, the maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation for the Utility would be approximately million. If EMANI losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment of approximately million. For more information about the Utility s nuclear insurance coverage, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K.

 The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Term Benchmark Loans to ABR Loans by giving the Designated Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election no later than 12 00 Noon, New York City time, on the Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date, provided that any such conversion of Term Benchmark Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert ABR Loans to Term Benchmark Loans by giving the Designated Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election no later than 12 00 Noon, New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date (which notice shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor), provided that no ABR Loan may be converted into a Term Benchmark Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Required Lenders have determined in their sole discretion not to permit such conversions. Upon receipt of any such notice the Designated Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. 
 Any Term Benchmark Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Designated Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the defined term Interest Period , of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans, provided that no Term Benchmark Loan may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Required Lenders have determined in their sole discretion not to permit such continuations provided , further , that if the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph, subject to the preceding proviso, such Loans shall be automatically continued as Term Benchmark Loans with an Interest Period of one month on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period. Upon receipt of any such notice the Designated Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. 
 Limitations on Term Benchmark Tranches . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and continuations of Term Benchmark Loans and all selections of Interest Periods shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Term Benchmark Loans comprising each Term Benchmark Tranche shall be equal to 1,000,000 or a whole multiple of 500,000 in excess thereof and no more than 15 Term Benchmark Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time. 
 Interest Rates and Payment Dates . 
 42 

Each Term Benchmark Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin. 
 Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus the Applicable Margin. 
 If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a default rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of the Loans, the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section plus 2 or (y) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations, the rate applicable to ABR Loans plus 2 , and if all or a portion of any interest payable on any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation or any commitment fee, letter of credit fee, or any other fee payable (excluding any expenses or other indemnity) hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a default rate per annum equal to the rate then applicable to ABR Loans plus 2 , in each case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from the date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment). 
 Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, provided that interest accruing pursuant to Section 2.11(c) shall be payable from time to time on demand. 
 The amount of each interest payment received by the Designated Agent under the Senior Bond shall be deemed to be a payment of interest payable by the Borrower hereunder and shall reduce, dollar-for-dollar, the amount of interest then owing by the Borrower hereunder. 
 Computation of Interest and Fees . 
 Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to ABR Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the basis of ABR, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. The Designated Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination of the ABR and the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR (or, for purposes of any determination of the ABR pursuant to clause (c) thereof, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate) shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Designated Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate. 
 Each determination of an interest rate by the Designated Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall constitute prima facie evidence of such amounts. The Designated Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower or any Lender, deliver to the Borrower or such Lender a statement showing the quotations used by the Designated Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 2.11(a). 
 43 

Inability to Determine Interest Rate . 
 Subject to clauses (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this Section 2.13 , if 
 the Designated Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Loan, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or the Term SOFR Rate (including because the Term SOFR Reference Rate is not available or published on a current basis), for such Interest Period or (B) at any time, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate, Daily Simple SOFR or 
 the Designated Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Loan, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) for such Interest Period or (B) at any time, Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) 
 then the Designated Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Designated Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (A) any notice from the Borrower to the Designated Agent that requests the conversion of any Loans to, or continuation of any Loans as, a Term Benchmark Loan shall instead be deemed to request the conversion of any Loans to, or continuation of any Loans as, (x) an RFR Loan so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate is not also the subject of Section 2.13(a)(i) or (ii) above or (y) an ABR Loan if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate also is the subject of Section 2.13(a)(i) or (ii) above and (B) if any borrowing notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.2 requests a borrowing of Term Benchmark Loans, such borrowing (unless the applicable notice of borrowing shall have been withdrawn by the Borrower) shall be made as (x) an RFR Loan so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate is not also the subject of Section 2.13(a)(i) or (ii) above or (y) an ABR Loan if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate also is the subject of Section 2.13(a)(i) or (ii) above provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of borrowings, then the other Type of borrowings shall be permitted. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document (and any Swap Agreement shall be deemed not to be a Loan Document for purposes of this Section 2.13), if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with 
 44 

clause (2) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5 00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Designated Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders of each affected Class. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, the Designated Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
 The Designated Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (f) below and the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Designated Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.13, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.13. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Rate) and either any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Designated Agent in its reasonable discretion or the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Designated Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Designated Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. 
 45 

Upon the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Term Benchmark Loan or conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any request for a Term Benchmark Loan into a request for a Loan of or conversion to (A) an RFR Loan so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (B) an ABR Loan if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan is outstanding on the date of the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until such time as a Benchmark Replacement is implemented pursuant to this Section 2.13, any Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), be converted by the Designated Agent to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Loan so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (y) an ABR Loan if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event, on such day. 
 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments Notes . 
 Each borrowing by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of any commitment fee and any reduction of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be made pro rata according to the respective Percentages of the Lenders. 
 Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Loans then held by the Lenders. Each payment in respect of Reimbursement Obligations in respect of any Letter of Credit shall be made to the Issuing Lender that issued such Letters of Credit. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, Reimbursement Obligations, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 4 00 P.M., New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Designated Agent, for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders, as applicable, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Designated Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Term Benchmark Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Term Benchmark Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar 
 46 

month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. 
 Unless the Designated Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Designated Agent, the Designated Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Designated Agent, and the Designated Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Designated Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Designated Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Designated Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Designated Agent. A certificate of the Designated Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender s share of such borrowing is not made available to the Designated Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Designated Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans from the Borrower within 30 days after written demand therefor. 
 Unless the Designated Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Designated Agent, the Designated Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Designated Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective pro rata shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Designated Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Designated Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the NYFRB Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Designated Agent or any Lender against the Borrower. 
 The Borrower agrees that, upon the request to the Designated Agent by any Lender, the Borrower will promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note (a Note of the Borrower evidencing any Revolving Loans of such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit H, with appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount provided , that delivery of Notes shall not be a condition precedent to the occurrence of the Effective Date or the making of Loans on the Effective Date. 
 If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 3.4 or 2.14(d), then the Designated Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, apply any amounts thereafter received by the Designated Agent hereunder for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Designated Agent or any Issuing Lender to satisfy such Lender s obligations to the Designated Agent or such Issuing Lender, as 
 47 

the case may be, under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and or so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Designated Agent in its discretion. 
 Change of Law . 
 If a Change of Law shall 
 subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than Indemnified Taxes, Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and Connection Income Taxes) on its Loans, Letters of Credit or Commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto 
 impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance charge or other similar insurance charge or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any Lender or any Issuing Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, which requirements are generally applicable to advances, loans and other extensions of credit made by such Lender or such Issuing Lender or 
 impose on any Lender or any Issuing Lender any other condition that is generally applicable to loans made by such Lender or Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender or participations therein by a Lender 
 and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient, by an amount that such Lender or such other Recipient deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender or such other Recipient, within ten Business Days after its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such other Recipient for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender or other Recipient becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Designated Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled provided , however , that no Lender or other Recipient shall be entitled to demand such compensation more than 90 days following (x) the last day of the Interest Period in respect of which such demand is made or (y) the repayment of the Loan in respect of which such demand is made, and no Issuing Lender shall be entitled to demand such compensation more than 90 days following the expiration or termination (by drawing or otherwise) of the Letter of Credit issued by it in respect of which such demand is made. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no Lender shall demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.15 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such Lender to demand such compensation from similarly situated borrowers (to the extent that such Lender has the right to do so under its credit facilities with similarly situated borrowers). 
 48 

If any Lender or any Issuing Lender shall have determined that a Change of Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such Issuing Lender s capital or the capital of any corporation controlling such Lender or such Issuing Lender as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender, such Issuing Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such Change of Law (taking into consideration such Lender s, such Issuing Lender s or such corporation s policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender or such Issuing Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender or such Issuing Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Designated Agent) of a written request therefor, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or such Issuing Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, such Issuing Lender or such corporation for such reduction. 
 A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.15 submitted by any Lender, any Issuing Lender or any other Recipient to the Borrower (with a copy to the Designated Agent) shall constitute prima facie evidence of such costs or amounts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.15, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender, any Issuing Lender or any other Recipient pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender, such Issuing Lender or such other Recipient notifies the Borrower of such Lender s, such Issuing Lender s or such other Recipient s intention to claim compensation therefor provided that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect not to exceed twelve months. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall survive for 90 days after the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts then due and payable hereunder. 
 Taxes . 
 Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable laws. If any applicable laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Borrower or Designated Agent making the payment) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then the Borrower or Designated Agent, as applicable shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Borrower or the Designated Agent to be required, the Borrower or Designated Agent, as applicable shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such laws, and to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.16) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. 
 49 

Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Designated Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
 The Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.16) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or another Recipient (with a copy to the Designated Agent), or by the Designated Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or another Recipient, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 Each Lender and each Issuing Lender shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, (x) the Designated Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender or such Issuing Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Designated Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (y) the Designated Agent against any Taxes attributable to such Lender s or such Issuing Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.6(c)(iii) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Designated Agent against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender or such Issuing Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Designated Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender or any Issuing Lender by the Designated Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender and each Issuing Lender hereby authorizes the Designated Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Designated Agent under this clause (ii). 
 Upon request by the Borrower or the Designated Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or by the Designated Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 2.16, the Borrower shall deliver to the Designated Agent or the Designated Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Designated Agent, as the case may be. 
 Any Lender or any Issuing Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Designated Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Designated Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably 
 50 

requested by the Borrower or the Designated Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender or any Issuing Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Designated Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Designated Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Designated Agent to determine whether or not such Lender or such Issuing Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.16(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s or any Issuing Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender or such Issuing Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender or such Issuing Lender. 
 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
 any Lender or any Issuing Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Designated Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender or such Issuing Lender becomes a Lender or an Issuing Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Designated Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender or such Issuing Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax 
 any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Designated Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender or an Issuing Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Designated Agent), whichever of the following is applicable 
 in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty 
 executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI 
 in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 
 51 

881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable or 
 to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-2 or Exhibit G-3, IRS Form W-9, and or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner. 
 any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Designated Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender or an Issuing Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Designated Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Designated Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made and 
 if a payment made to a Lender or any Issuing Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender or such Issuing Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender or such Issuing Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Designated Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Designated Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3) (C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Designated Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Designated Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender or such Issuing Lender has complied with such Lender s or such Issuing Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Effective Date. 
 Each Lender and each Issuing Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.16 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Designated Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
 At no time shall the Designated Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Lender any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of, or credit 
 52 

with respect to, any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.16 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16), it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund or credit (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund or credit), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund or credit). The Borrower, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund or credit to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund or credit had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph (f) shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
 Each party s obligations under this Section 2.16 shall survive for one year after the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 
 Indemnity . The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss (other than the loss of Applicable Margin) or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Term Benchmark Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or the making of a prepayment of Term Benchmark Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive for 90 days after the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 
 Change of Lending Office . Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.15 or 2.16 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event provided, that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole but reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no unreimbursed economic disadvantage or any legal or regulatory 
 53 

disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16. 
 Replacement of Lenders . The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that requests (on its behalf or any of its Participants) reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16, (b) provides notice under Section 2.21 or (c) becomes a Defaulting Lender, with a replacement financial institution provided that such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.18 which eliminates the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16, the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.17 if any Term Benchmark Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, the replacement financial institution, if not already a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Designated Agent, the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein), until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16, as the case may be, and any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Designated Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender. 
 Defaulting Lenders . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law 
 any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts (other than those described in Section 2.20(b)) received by the Designated Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 7 or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Designated Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.7), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Designated Agent as follows first , to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Designated Agent hereunder second , to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Lender hereunder third , if so requested by any Issuing Lender with a Letter of Credit outstanding or with unreimbursed drawings owing under a Letter of Credit, to be held as cash collateral in respect of such Defaulting Lender s Percentage of such L C Obligations fourth , if so determined by the Designated Agent or requested by any Issuing Lender, to be held as cash collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any L C Obligations fifth , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Designated Agent sixth , if so determined by the Borrower with the consent of the Designated Agent, not to be unreasonably withheld, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund 
 54 

Loans under this Agreement seventh , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or any Issuing Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or any Issuing Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement eighth , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement and ninth , to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction provided that if such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or unreimbursed drawings under Letters of Credit in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans and unreimbursed drawings under Letters of Credit of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of that Defaulting Lender or participating interests of that Defaulting Lender in unreimbursed drawings under Letters of Credit. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.20(a) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto 
 reserved 
 during any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 3.4, the Percentage of each non-Defaulting Lender shall be computed without giving effect to the Commitment of that Defaulting Lender provided, that, (i) each such reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Default or Event of Default exists and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in L C Obligations shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) the Commitment of that non-Defaulting Lender minus (2) the aggregate outstanding Loans of that Lender and that Lender s Percentage of L C Obligations. Subject to Section 10.20, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 
 if the reallocation described in paragraph (c) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Designated Agent (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to paragraph (c) above) deposit cash with the Designated Agent as collateral to secure such Defaulting Lender s Percentage of any outstanding L C Obligations for so long as any such L C Obligation are outstanding and 
 that Defaulting Lender s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and Section 10.1. 
 55 

If the Borrower, the Designated Agent and each Issuing Lender reasonably determine in writing that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Designated Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans and Participation Amounts of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Designated Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Percentages (without giving effect to Section 2.20(c)), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 
 Cash collateral held by the Designated Agent to reduce Fronting Exposure shall be released to the applicable Lender promptly following the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 10.6)) the Designated Agent s good faith determination that there exists excess cash collateral and the termination of the Commitment Period and the repayment in full of all outstanding Loans and L C Obligations. 
 Illegality . If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain, or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower (through the Designated Agent), (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term Benchmark Loans or to convert ABR Loans to Term Benchmark Loans shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate component of the ABR, the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Designated Agent without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate component of the ABR, in each case until such Lender notifies the Designated Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Designated Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term Benchmark Loans of such Lender to ABR Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Designated Agent without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate component of the ABR), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loans and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates 
 56 

based upon the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Designated Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the ABR applicable to such Lender without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate component thereof until the Designated Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.17. 
 LETTERS OF CREDIT 
 L C Commitment . 
 Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue standby and commercial letters of credit (the letters of credit issued pursuant to this Section 3 and including each Existing Letter of Credit, collectively, the Letters of Credi t for the account of the Borrower on any Business Day on or after the Effective Date and during the Commitment Period in such form as may be approved from time to time by such Issuing Lender provided , that each of Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Credit Suisse AG, New York Branch, Barclays Bank PLC and their respective Affiliates shall not be required to issue any commercial letters of credit provided further that no Issuing Lender shall issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, amendment or extension, the aggregate amount of L C Obligations owed by the Borrower to any Issuing Lender shall exceed the amount of such Issuing Lender s L C Pro Rata Commitment (or such higher amount agreed upon in writing between the Borrower and such Issuing Lender), the L C Obligations would exceed the L C Commitment, the aggregate amount of the Available Commitments would be less than zero or (iv) the Total Extensions of Credit would exceed the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Bond at any time (as determined by the Designated Agent). Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated in Dollars and, (ii) subject to the second paragraph of Section 3.2, expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance and (y) the date which is five Business Days prior to the Termination Date (such fifth Business Day, the Letter of Credit Expiration Date ). 
 No Issuing Lender shall at any time be obligated to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit hereunder if such issuance, amendment or extension would conflict with, or cause such Issuing Lender or any L C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law, violate one or more policies of the Issuing Lender applicable to letters of credit generally or (iii) violate any order, judgment, or decree of any Governmental Authority that, by its terms, purports to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to such Issuing Lender. No Issuing Lender shall be under any obligation to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit that is not a standby Letter of Credit, unless otherwise agreed by such Issuing Lender. In the event there is a Defaulting Lender as of the date of any request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue or arrange for such Letter of Credit to the extent the Issuing Lender is not reasonably satisfied that the Defaulting Lender s L C Obligations with respect to such Letter of Credit have been reallocated and or cash collateralized pursuant to Section 2.20. 
 57 

Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time provided , however , that with respect to any Letter of Credit that provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at such time. 
 For all purposes of this Agreement, if on any date of determination, a Letter of Credit has expired by its terms but any amount may still be drawn thereunder by reason of the operation of any rule of law or uniform practices to which any Letter of Credit is subject (including Rule 3.13 and Rule 3.14 of the ISP) or similar terms in the Letter of Credit itself that permit a drawing to be made under such Letter of Credit after the expiration thereof, such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be outstanding in the amount so remaining available to be drawn. 
 Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit . The Borrower may from time to time request that an Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to such Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of such Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as such Issuing Lender may request. Concurrently with the delivery of an Application to an Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall deliver a copy thereof to the Designated Agent and the Designated Agent shall provide notice of such request to the Lenders. Upon receipt of any Application, an Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by such Issuing Lender and the Borrower (but in no event shall any Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto). Promptly after issuance by an Issuing Lender of a Letter of Credit, such Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Borrower. The Borrower is responsible for the final text of the Letter of Credit as issued by an Issuing Lender, irrespective of any assistance such Issuing Lender may provide such as drafting or recommending text or by Issuing Lender s use or refusal to use text submitted by the Borrower. The Borrower is solely responsible for the suitability of the Letter of Credit for the Borrower s purposes. Each Issuing Lender shall promptly give notice to the Designated Agent of the issuance of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender (including the amount thereof), and shall provide a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Designated Agent as soon as possible after the date of issuance. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by an Issuing Lender and the Borrower, when a Letter of Credit is issued the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit. 
 If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Application, the Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must 
 58 

permit the Issuing Lender to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Non-Extension Notice Date in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the Issuing Lender for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the Issuing Lender to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date provided , however , that the Issuing Lender shall not permit any such extension if it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date from the Designated Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or from the Designated Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 5.2 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the Issuing Lender not to permit such extension. 
 Fees and Other Charges . 
 The Borrower will pay a fee on the aggregate drawable amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Term Benchmark Loans, shared ratably among the Lenders (other than Defaulting Lenders to the extent provided in Section 2.20) in accordance with their respective Percentages and payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. In addition, the Borrower shall pay to the relevant Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee on the aggregate drawable amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit issued in an amount to be agreed between the Borrower and such Issuing Lender, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. 
 In addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse each Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment under, amending, extending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit. 
 L C Participations . 
 Each Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L C Participant, and, to induce each Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, each L C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from each Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions hereinafter stated, for such L C Participant s own account and risk, an undivided interest equal to such L C Participant s Percentage in each Issuing Lender s obligations and rights under each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender hereunder and the amount of each drawing paid by such Issuing Lender thereunder. Each L C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with each Issuing Lender that, if a drawing is paid under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender for which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L C Participant shall pay to the Designated Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender upon 
 59 

demand at such Issuing Lender s address for notices specified herein (and thereafter the Designated Agent shall promptly pay to such Issuing Lender) an amount equal to such L C Participant s Percentage of the amount of such drawing, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed. Each L C Participant s obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L C Participant may have against the Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower or any other L C Participant or any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. 
 If any amount (a Participation Amount required to be paid by any L C Participant to an Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is not paid to such Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing Lender shall so notify the Designated Agent, which shall promptly notify the L C Participants, and each L C Participant shall pay to the Designated Agent, for the account of such Issuing Lender, on demand (and thereafter the Designated Agent shall promptly pay to such Issuing Lender) an amount equal to the product of such Participation Amount, times the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Lender, times a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any Participation Amount required to be paid by any L C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to the Designated Agent for the account of the relevant Issuing Lender by such L C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, the Designated Agent on behalf of such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L C Participant, on demand, such Participation Amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans. A certificate of the Designated Agent submitted on behalf of an Issuing Lender to any L C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. 
 Whenever, at any time after an Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from the Designated Agent any L C Participant s pro rata share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), such Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by such Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, such Issuing Lender will distribute to the Designated Agent for the account of such L C Participant (and thereafter the Designated Agent will promptly distribute to such L C Participant) its pro rata share thereof provided , however , that in the event that any such payment received by such Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Lender, such L C Participant shall return to the Designated Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender (and thereafter the Designated Agent shall promptly return to such Issuing Lender) the portion thereof previously distributed by such Issuing Lender. 
 60 

Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower . The Borrower agrees to reimburse each Issuing Lender on (i) the Business Day on which the Borrower receives notice from an Issuing Lender of a drawing on a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender and paid by such Issuing Lender, if such notice is received on such Business Day prior to 11 00 A.M., New York City time, or (ii) if clause (i) above does not apply, the Business Day immediately following the day on which the Borrower receives such notice, for the amount of such draft so paid and any taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by such Issuing Lender in connection with such payment which are obligations of the Borrower hereunder (the amounts described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) in respect of any drawing, collectively, the Payment Amount ). Each such payment shall be made to such Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein in lawful money of the United States and in immediately available funds. Interest shall be payable on each Payment Amount from the date of the applicable drawing until payment in full at the rate set forth in until the second Business Day following the date of the applicable drawing, Section 2.11(b) and thereafter, Section 2.11(c). If the Borrower fails to make such payment in accordance with the foregoing, such failure shall be deemed to constitute a request by the Borrower to the Designated Agent for a borrowing pursuant to Section 2.1 of ABR Loans in an amount equal to the Payment Amount. The Borrowing Date with respect to such borrowing shall be the first date on which a borrowing of Revolving Loans could be made, pursuant to Section 2.1, if the Designated Agent had received a notice of such borrowing at the time the Designated Agent receives notice from the relevant Issuing Lender of such drawing under such Letter of Credit. 
 Obligations Absolute . The Borrower s obligations under this Section 3 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower may have or have had against any Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person. The Borrower also agrees with each Issuing Lender that such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower s Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. No Issuing Lender shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions caused by such Issuing Lender s gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by an Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender to the Borrower. The liability of an Issuing Lender under, in connection with or arising out of any Letter of Credit (or pre-advice), regardless of the form or legal grounds of the action or proceeding, shall be limited to direct damages suffered by the Borrower that is caused directly by such Issuing Lender s gross negligence or willful misconduct, in each case as determined in a 
 61 

final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in (i) honoring a presentation under a Letter of Credit that on its face does not at least substantially comply with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, (ii) failing to honor a presentation under a Letter of Credit that strictly complies with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, or (iii) retaining documents presented for purposes of drawing under any Letter of Credit, including by electronic transmission such as SWIFT, electronic mail, facsimile or computer generated communication presented under a Letter of Credit (collectively, Drawing Documents ). The Borrower s aggregate remedies against any Issuing Lender for wrongfully honoring a presentation under any Letter of Credit or wrongfully retaining honored Drawing Documents shall in no event exceed the aggregate amount paid by the Borrower to the Issuing Lender in respect of the honored presentation in connection with such Letter of Credit under Section 3.5, plus interest at the rate then applicable to ABR Loans hereunder. 
 Letter of Credit Payments . If any documents shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Lender shall, within the period stipulated by the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, examine the drawing documents. After such examination and provided that the drawing documents are compliant, such Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Borrower and the Designated Agent of the date and amount thereof. The responsibility of the relevant Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any documents presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, shall be limited, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, in each case as determined in a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment appear on their face to be in conformity with such Letter of Credit. 
 Applications . To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 3, the provisions of this Section 3 shall apply. 
 Actions of Issuing Lenders . Each Issuing Lender shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any draft, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by such Issuing Lender. Each Issuing Lender shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall first have received such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it reasonably deems appropriate (provided that no Issuing Lender shall be under any obligation to obtain such advice or concurrence and no L C Participant's obligations hereunder shall be affected by the seeking or the failure to seek any such advice or concurrence) or it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, as between the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders, each Issuing Lender shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this 
 62 

Agreement in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and any future holders of a participation in any Letter of Credit (provided that no Issuing Lender shall be under any obligation to obtain such request and no L C Participant's obligations hereunder shall be affected by the seeking or the failure to seek any such request). 
 Borrower s Indemnification . The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, each Issuing Lender (and each of its branches and Affiliates) and the Designated Agent, and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees from and against any and all claims and damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which such Lender, such Issuing Lender or the Designated Agent may incur (or which may be claimed against such Lender, such Issuing Lender or the Designated Agent by any Person whatsoever) by reason of or in connection with the issuance, execution and delivery or transfer of or payment or failure to pay under any Letter of Credit or any actual or proposed use of any Letter of Credit, including, without limitation, any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which such Issuing Lender may incur by reason of or in connection with the failure of any other Lender to fulfill or comply with its obligations to an Issuing Lender hereunder (but nothing herein contained shall affect any rights the Borrower may have against any Defaulting Lender) or by reason of or on account of an Issuing Lender issuing any Letter of Credit which specifies that the term Beneficiary included therein includes any successor by operation of law of the named Beneficiary, but which Letter of Credit does not require that any drawing by any such successor Beneficiary be accompanied by a copy of a legal document, satisfactory to such Issuing Lender, evidencing the appointment of such successor Beneficiary provided that the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Lender, any Issuing Lender or the Designated Agent for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (x) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Issuing Lender in determining whether a request presented under any Letter of Credit complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit as determined in a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (y) such Issuing Lender s failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. Nothing in this Section is intended to limit the obligations of the Borrower under any other provision of this Agreement. This indemnification provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and all Letters of Credit.

 THE AGENTS

The provisions of this Section 9 are solely for the benefit of the Agents, the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions (other than with respect to the Borrower s rights under Sections 9.9(a) and (b)). It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
 Delegation of Duties . The Designated Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it. The Designated Agent, and any such sub-agent may each perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Section shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Designated Agent, and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Designated Agent. The Designated Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Designated Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. 
 Exculpatory Provisions . 
 No Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Agent 
 shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing 
 80 

shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that an Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents) provided that no Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law and 
 shall, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. 
 No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.1 and 8), or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. 
 No Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 5 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent. 
 Reliance by Designated Agent . The Designated Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Designated Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Lender, the Designated Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such Issuing Lender unless the Designated Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance, extension, 
 81 

renewal or increase of such Letter of Credit. The Designated Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
 Notice of Default . The Designated Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Designated Agent has received notice from a Lender, an Issuing Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default . In the event that the Designated Agent receives such a notice, the Designated Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders. The Designated Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) provided that unless and until such Agent shall have received such directions, such Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders. 
 Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders . Each Lender and Issuing Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents, or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and Issuing Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents, or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Designated Agent hereunder, the Designated Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys in fact or Affiliates. 
 Indemnification . The Lenders and the Issuing Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such 
 82 

Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing provided that no Lender or Issuing Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent s gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
 Agent in Its Individual Capacity . Each Person serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender or an Issuing Lender as any other Lender or Issuing Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms Lender , Issuing Lender , Lenders or Issuing Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include such Person serving as an Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not an Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders. 
 Successor Agents . 
 The Designated Agent may resign upon 10 days notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If the Designated Agent shall so resign under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 8(f) with respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Designated Agent and the term Designated Agent shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Agent s rights, powers and duties as Designated Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Designated Agent by the date that is 10 days following a retiring Agent s notice of resignation (the Resignation Effective Date ), the retiring Agent s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Designated Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. After any retiring Agent s resignation as Designated Agent the provisions of Section 9.7 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was an Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 If the Person serving as Designated Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (e) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Designated Agent and, shall appoint a successor, subject to the approval of the Borrower (unless an Event of Default under Section 8(f) with respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If no such successor shall 
 83 

have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Removal Effective Date ), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. 
 With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of the Senior Bond held by the Designated Agent on behalf of the Lenders or any Issuing Lender, the retiring or removed Designated Agent shall continue to hold such Senior Bond in its name until such time as a successor Designated Agent is appointed) and except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Designated Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Designated Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and each Issuing Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Designated Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Designated Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable)), and the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring or removed Agent s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Section and Sections 2.17, 3.10 and 10.5 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Agent was acting as Agent. 
 Documentation Agents and Syndication Agents . None of the Administrative Agent, the Documentation Agents or the Syndication Agents shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in its capacity as such. 
 Designated Agent May File Proofs of Claim . In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law, the Designated Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Designated Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise 
 to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Designated Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Designated Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders,

 (A) in the case of immediately preceding clauses (x) or (y), an error shall be presumed to have been made (absent written confirmation from the Designated Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error has been made (in the case of immediately preceding clause (z)), in each case, with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment and 
 such Lender or Issuing Lender shall (and shall cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of such error) notify the Designated Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Designated Agent pursuant to this Section 9.13(b) . 
 Each Lender or Issuing Lender hereby authorizes the Designated Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or Issuing Lender under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Designated Agent to such Lender or Issuing Lender from any source, against any amount due to the Designated Agent under immediately preceding clause (a) or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement. 
 In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Designated Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by the Designated Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender or Issuing Lender that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and or from any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency ), upon the Designated Agent s notice to such Lender or Issuing Lender at any time, (i) such Lender or Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Loans (but not its Commitments) with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the Erroneous Payment Impacted Class in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Designated Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Loans (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Class, the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by the Designated Agent in such instance), and is hereby (together with the Borrower) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to the Platform as to which the Designated Agent and such parties are participants) with

The Designated Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Loans acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender or Issuing Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Loan (or portion thereof), and the Designated Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender or Issuing Lender (and or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf). For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender or Issuing Lender and such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, each party hereto agrees that, except to the extent that the Designated Agent has sold a Loan (or portion thereof) acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and irrespective of whether the Designated Agent may be equitably subrogated, the Designated Agent shall be contractually subrogated to all the rights and interests of the applicable Lender or Issuing Lender under the Loan Documents with respect to each Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (the Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights ). 
 The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Designated Agent from the Borrower for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment. 
 To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Designated Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine. 
 Each party s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 9.13 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Designated Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender or Issuing Lender, the termination of the Commitments and or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.

 96 

(b) of this Section, the Designated Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement provided that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of Section 10.1 and directly affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Designated Agent (in 
 97 

its capacity as Designated Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
 Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

 Benchmark Replacement for any Available Tenor, the first alternative set forth in the order below that can be determined by the Administrative Agent for the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date 
 (1) the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate and 
 (2) the sum of (a) the alternate benchmark rate that has been selected by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower as the replacement for the then-current Benchmark for the applicable Corresponding Tenor giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a replacement benchmark rate or the mechanism for determining such a rate by the Relevant Governmental Body or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a benchmark rate as a replacement for the then-current Benchmark for dollar-denominated syndicated credit facilities at such time in the United States and (b) the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment

 (2) in the case of clause (3) of the definition of Benchmark Transition Event, the first date on which such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) has been determined and announced by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) to be no longer representative provided, that such non-representativeness will be determined by reference to the most recent statement or publication referenced in such clause (c) and even if any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) continues to be provided on such date. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if the event giving rise to the Benchmark Replacement Date occurs on the same day as, but earlier than, the Reference Time in respect of any determination, the Benchmark Replacement Date will be deemed to have occurred prior to the Reference Time for such determination and (ii) the Benchmark Replacement Date will be deemed to have occurred in the case of clause (1) or (2) with respect to any Benchmark upon the occurrence of the applicable event or events set forth therein with respect to all then-current Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof). 
 7

 (2) a public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof), the Federal Reserve Board, the NYFRB, the CME Term SOFR Administrator, an insolvency official with jurisdiction over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component), a resolution authority with jurisdiction over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component) or a court or an entity with similar insolvency or resolution authority over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component), in each case, which states that the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component) has ceased or will cease to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) permanently or indefinitely provided that, at the time of such statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) or 
 (3) a public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) announcing that all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) are no longer, or as of a specified future date will no longer be, representative. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, a Benchmark Transition Event will be deemed to have occurred with respect to any Benchmark if a public statement or publication of information set forth above has occurred with respect to each then-current Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof). 
 Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to any Benchmark, the period (if any) (x) beginning at the time that a Benchmark Replacement Date has occurred if, at such time, no Benchmark Replacement has replaced such then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any other Loan Document in accordance with Section 2.13 and (y) ending at the time that a Benchmark Replacement has replaced such then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in accordance with Section 2.13

 42 

Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (2) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5 00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders of each affected Class.

In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. 
 Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender s share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans from the Borrower within 30 days after written demand therefor. 
 Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective pro rata shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the NYFRB Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower. 
 The Borrower agrees that, upon the request to the Administrative Agent by any Lender, the Borrower will promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note (a Note of the Borrower evidencing any Revolving Loans of such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit H, with appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount provided , that delivery of Notes shall not be a condition precedent to the occurrence of the Effective Date or the making of Loans on the Effective Date. 
 If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.14(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary 
 45 

provision hereof, apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent to satisfy such Lender s obligations to the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and or so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion. 
 Change of Law . 
 If a Change of Law shall 
 subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its Loans or Commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto 
 impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance charge or other similar insurance charge or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, which requirements are generally applicable to advances, loans and other extensions of credit made by such Lender or 
 impose on any Lender any other condition that is generally applicable to loans made by such Lender or participations therein by a Lender 
 and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient, by an amount that such Lender or such other Recipient deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Loans, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender or such other Recipient, within ten Business Days after its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such other Recipient for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender or other Recipient becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled provided , however , that no Lender or other Recipient shall be entitled to demand such compensation more than 90 days following (x) the last day of the Interest Period in respect of which such demand is made or (y) the repayment of the Loan in respect of which such demand is made. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no Lender shall demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.15 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such Lender to demand such compensation from similarly situated borrowers (to the extent that such Lender has the right to do so under its credit facilities with similarly situated borrowers). 
 46 

If any Lender shall have determined that a Change of Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or the capital of any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such Change of Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or such corporation s policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction. 
 A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.15 submitted by any Lender or any other Recipient to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall constitute prima facie evidence of such costs or amounts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.15, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or any other Recipient pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or such other Recipient notifies the Borrower of such Lender s or such other Recipient s intention to claim compensation therefor provided that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect not to exceed twelve months. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall survive for 90 days after the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts then due and payable hereunder. 
 Taxes . 
 Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable laws. If any applicable laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Borrower or Administrative Agent making the payment) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then (A) the Borrower or Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to be required, (B) the Borrower or Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.16) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. 
 Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
 47 

The Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.16) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or another Recipient (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or another Recipient, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 Each Lender shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, x the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), y the Administrative Agent against any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.6(c) (iii) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and z the Administrative Agent against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii). 
 Upon request by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 2.16, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be. 
 Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative 
 48 

Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.16(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
 any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax 
 any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable

 if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3) (C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Effective Date. 
 Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.16 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
 At no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of, or credit with respect to, any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified 
 50 

pursuant to this Section 2.16 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16), it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund or credit (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund or credit), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund or credit). The Borrower, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund or credit to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund or credit had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph (f) shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
 Each party s obligations under this Section 2.16 shall survive for one year after the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive for 90 days after the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 
 Change of Lending Office . Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.15 or 2.16 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event provided , that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole but reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no unreimbursed economic disadvantage or any legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided , further , that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16.

 52 

appropriate share such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.20(a) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto

The provisions of this Section 9 Section 9 are solely for the benefit of the Agents, the Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions (other than with respect to the Borrower s rights under Sections 9.9(a) 9.9(a) and (b) (b) ). It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote 
 77 

any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
 Delegation of Duties . The Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent may each perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it. The Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent may each perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Section shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that such Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. 
 Exculpatory Provisions . 
 No Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Agent 
 shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing 
 shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that an Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents) provided that no Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law and 
 shall, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. 
 No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be 
 78 

necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.1 and 8 7.7 ), or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. 
 No Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 5 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent. 
 Reliance by Agents . The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
 Notice of Defaul t.

In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders and the Collateral Agent. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall each take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) provided that unless and until such Agent shall have received such directions, such Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders. 
 79 

Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders . Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent hereunder, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys in fact or Affiliates.

Leaves of Absence For purposes of this Agreement, if you are on an approved leave of absence from PG&E Corporation, or a recipient of PG&E Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will continue to be considered as employed. If you do not return to active employment upon the expiration of your leave of absence or the expiration of your PG&E Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will be considered to have voluntarily terminated your employment. See above under Voluntary Termination. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the leave of absence exceeds six (6) months, and a return to service upon expiration of such leave is not guaranteed by statute or contract, then you will be deemed to have had a separation from service for purposes of any Restricted Stock Units that are settled hereunder upon such separation. To the extent an authorized leave of absence is due to a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or to last for a continuous period of at least six (6) months and such impairment causes you to be unable to perform the duties of your position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, the six (6) month period in the prior sentence will be twenty-nine (29) months. 
 PG&E Corporation reserves the right to determine which leaves of absence will be considered as continuing employment and when your employment terminates for all purposes under this Agreement. 
 Voting and Other Rights You will not have voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units until the date the underlying shares are issued (as evidenced by appropriate entry on the books of PG&E Corporation or its duly authorized transfer agent). No Restricted Stock Units and no shares of Stock that have not been issued hereunder may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, or otherwise encumbered, other than by will or the laws of decent and distribution, and the Restricted Stock Units may be exercised during the life of the Recipient only by the Recipient or the Recipient s guardian or legal representative. No Retention Rights This Agreement is not an employment agreement and does not give you the right to be retained by PG&E Corporation. Except as otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement, PG&E Corporation reserves the right to terminate your employment at any time and for any reason.
