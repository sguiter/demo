 Notes to Unaudited Conde nsed Financial Statements 
 Nine Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2024 , the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses in the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of million. The Company currently believes that its cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will enable it to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the fourth quarter of 2025 based on its current operating budget and cash flow forecast. However, as a result of its successful Type C meeting with the U.S. FDA in August 2024 with respect to the HLHS regulatory pathway, the Company has started to ramp up Biologics License Application (BLA) enabling activities as the Company currently anticipates a potential filing with the FDA in 2026 if the current ELPIS II trial is successful. To the extent that the Company s operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements accelerate in calendar 2025 as a result of these activities, including CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls) and manufacturing readiness, there will be a need to increase the Company's current proposed spend and further increase its capital investments. The Company intends to seek additional financing/capital raises/non-dilutive funding options to support these activities, and current cash projections may be impacted by these ramped up activities and any financing transactions entered into .

marketable securities at September 30, 2024. Marketable securities December 31, 2023 consisted of marketable fixed income securities, primarily corporate bonds which are categorized as available for sale securities and are thus marked to market and stated at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820 Fair Value Measurement . These investments are considered Level 1 and Level 2 investments within the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy. The fair value of Level 1 investments, including cash equivalents, money funds and U.S. government securities, are substantially based on quoted market prices in active markets. The fair value of corporate bonds is determined using standard market valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, matrix pricing and/or other similar techniques. The inputs to these valuation techniques include but are not limited to market interest rates, credit rating of the issuer or counterparty, industry sector of the issuer, coupon rate, call provisions, maturity, estimated duration and assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated future cash flows. In addition to bond characteristics, the valuation methodologies incorporate market data, such as actual trades completed, bids and actual dealer quotes, where such information is available. Accordingly, the estimated fair values are based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments categorized within Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Interest and dividends are recorded when earned. Realized gains and losses on investments are determined by specific identification and are recognized as incurred in the condensed statement of operations. Changes in net unrealized gains and losses are reported in other comprehensive loss and represent the change in the fair value of investment holdings during the reporting period. Changes in net unrealized losses were less than million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

million, respectively, of funds that were previously classified as deferred revenue. Due to the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund ("MSCRF") Technology Development Corporation TEDCO grant Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS program being discontinued, million recorded as deferred revenue was reversed when the funds were returned to MSCRF TEDCO. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had million and million, respectively, recorded in deferred revenue on the condensed balance sheets.

The Company records cost of revenues based on expenses directly related to revenue. For grants, the Company records allocated expenses for research and development costs to a grant as a cost of revenues. For the clinical trial revenue, directly related expenses for that program are expensed as incurred. These expenses are similar to those described under Research and development expense below. For the contract manufacturing, the Company records costs incurred under the contract as cost of revenues.

for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 due to net operating losses. The Company has not recorded any tax benefit for the net operating losses incurred due to the offset created by the Company s valuation allowance. The Company recognizes the tax benefits from uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. In the unlikely event an uncertain tax position exists in which the Company could incur income taxes, the Company would evaluate whether there is a probability that the uncertain tax position taken would be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. Reserves for uncertain tax positions would then be recorded if the Company determined it is probable that either a position would not be sustained upon examination, or a payment would have to be made to a taxing authority and the amount was reasonably estimable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company does not believe it has any uncertain tax positions that would result in the Company having a liability to a taxing authority. It is the Company s policy to expense any interest and penalties associated with its tax obligations when they are probable and estimable. 
 . The Company has insufficient historical data to utilize in determining its expected life assumptions and, therefore, uses the simplified method for determining expected life.

 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that reflect our current expectations about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. This 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that can involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy, prospective products, product approvals, research and development costs, future revenue, timing and likelihood of success, plans and objectives of management for future operations, future results of anticipated products and prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as anticipate, believe, contemplate, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, should, target, will, or would or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements contained in this report include, but are not limited to, statements about: 
 our cash position and need to raise additional capital, the difficulties we may face in obtaining access to capital, and the dilutive impact it may have on our investors; 

our financial performance, and ability to continue as a going concern; 

the period over which we estimate our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our future operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements; 

the ability of our clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of our product candidates, and other positive results; 

the timing and focus of our ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the reporting of data from those studies and trials; 

the size of the market opportunity for our product candidates, including our estimates of the number of patients who suffer from the diseases we are targeting; 

the success of competing therapies that are or may become available; 

the beneficial characteristics, safety, efficacy and therapeutic effects of our product candidates; 

our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of our product candidates in the U.S., and other jurisdictions; 

our plans relating to the further development of our product candidates, including additional disease states or indications we may pursue; 

our plans and ability to obtain or protect intellectual property rights, including extensions of existing patent terms where available and our ability to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of others;

We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about our business, the industry in which we operate and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or development. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this 10-Q. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

 Introduction and Overview 
 We are a clinical stage biotechnology company developing regenerative medicines to address unmet medical needs. The Company s lead investigational product is Lomecel-B , an allogeneic Medicinal Signaling Cell MSC formulation sourced from the bone marrow of young, healthy adult donors. Lomecel-B has multiple potential mechanisms of action that promote tissue repair and healing with broad potential applications across a spectrum of disease areas. The underlying mechanism(s) of action that may lead to the tissue repair programs include the stimulation of new blood vessel formation, modulation of the immune system, reduction in tissue fibrosis, and the stimulation of endogenous cells to divide and increase the numbers of certain specialized cells in the body. 
 We currently have three pipeline indications: Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome HLHS ), Alzheimer s disease AD ), and Aging-related Frailty. Our mission is to advance Lomecel-B and other cell-based product candidates into pivotal or Phase 3 trials, with the goal of achieving regulatory approvals, subsequent commercialization, and broad use by the healthcare community. 
 In November of 2023, Longeveron received notice from the World Health Organization WHO that laromestrocel has been selected as the proposed International Nonproprietary Name for Longeveron s Lomecel-B product. Upon final approval of the name by the WHO, Longeveron will adopt that name. 
 Financial Overview. Since inception, the Company has primarily been engaged in organizational activities, including raising capital, and research and development activities. The Company does not yet have a product that has been approved by the FDA, and has only generated revenues from grants, the Bahamas Registry Trials and contract manufacturing. The Company has not yet achieved profitable operations or generated positive cash flows from operations. The Company has incurred recurring losses from operations since its inception, and as of September 30, 2024 the Company had an accumulated deficit of 105.5 million. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. 
 With the completion of the offering and financing transactions in April and June 2024, subsequent warrant exercises, and offering and inducement transactions undertaken in July and September 2024, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the fourth quarter of 2025 based on our current operating budget and cash flow forecast. However, as a result of its successful Type C meeting with the U.S. FDA in August 2024 with respect to the HLHS regulatory pathway, we have started to ramp up Biologics License Application (BLA) enabling activities as we currently anticipate a potential filing with the FDA in 2026 if the current ELPIS II trial is successful. To the extent that our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements accelerate in calendar 2025 as a result of these activities, including CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls) and manufacturing readiness, there will be a need to increase our current proposed spend and further increase our capital investments. We intend to seek additional financing/capital raises/non-dilutive funding options to support these activities, and current cash projections may be impacted by these ramped up activities and any financing transactions entered into. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. To continue as a going concern we will need to obtain additional capital, which we will likely obtain through a variety of means, including through public or private equity, debt financings or other sources, including up-front payments and milestone payments from strategic collaborations. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of convertible debt or equity securities, current stockholder ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect stockholder rights. Such financing will likely result in dilution to stockholders, and may result in imposition of debt covenants, increased fixed payment obligations or other restrictions that may affect our business. If we raise additional funds through up-front payments or milestone payments pursuant to strategic collaborations with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.

Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) 
 Our HLHS program is focused on the potential clinical benefits of Lomecel-B as an adjunct therapeutic to standard-of-care HLHS surgery. HLHS is a rare and devastating congenital heart defect in which the left ventricle is severely underdeveloped. As such, babies born with this condition die shortly after birth without undergoing a complex series of reconstructive heart surgeries. Despite the availability of life-saving surgical interventions, clinical studies show that only 50 to 60 percent of affected individuals survive to adolescence. Early clinical study data shows the potential survival benefit of Lomecel-B for HLHS patients and supports Longeveron s belief that this data shows the potential to alter the treatment landscape for patients with HLHS. We have completed a Phase 1 open-label study ELPIS I 1 that supported the safety and tolerability of Lomecel-B for HLHS, when directly injected into the functional right ventricle ("RV") during the second-stage standard-of-care surgery (adding minimal additional time to the surgical procedure). Preliminary data revealed that several indices of right ventricular function show suggestions of either improvement or prevention of deterioration over one year following surgery. Heart transplant-free survival for patients who received Lomecel-B intracardiac injection is favorable as compared to historical controls for survival. The improvement in HLHS survival following the Phase 1 ELPIS I clinical trial resulted in acceptance by the American Heart Association AHA for a poster presentation at an AHA meeting in November 2023. The ELPIS I trial showed 100 percent transplant-free survival in children up to 5 years of age after receiving Lomecel-B , compared to a 20 percent mortality rate observed from historical control data. 
 Based on these findings, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA granted Lomecel-B Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD Designation, Orphan Drug Designation ODD ), and Fast Track Designation for treatment of infants with HLHS. On September 3, 2024, Longeveron announced a positive Type C meeting with the FDA supporting the advancement of Lonecel-B . Longeveron is currently conducting a controlled Phase 2b trial ELPIS II to compare the effects of Lomecel-B as an adjunct therapeutic versus standard-of-care (HLHS surgery alone). We hope that a positive outcome could add to the clinical data suggesting the functional and clinical benefit of Lomecel-B as part of standard-of-care treatment in HLHS patients. As a result of the Type C meeting, we reached foundational alignment with the FDA on the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints for ELPIS II. The FDA confirmed that, with several conditional requirements (including submission of a prespecified Statistical Analysis Plan and a Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls readiness plan to the FDA for prior review), ELPIS II is pivotal, and, if positive, acceptable for Biological License Application (BLA) submission for full traditional approval.

Alzheimer s disease (AD) 
 In September 2023, we completed our Phase 2a AD clinical trial, known as the CLEAR MIND trial. This trial enrolled patients with mild AD and was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study across ten U.S. centers. Our primary objective was to assess safety, and we tested three distinct Lomecel-B TM multiple dosing regimens against placebo. 
 The study demonstrated positive results. The established safety profile of Lomecel-B for single and multiple dosing regimens was demonstrated in study data that showed no incidence of hypersensitivity or infusion-related reactions, there were no cases of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), and all Lomecel-B treatment groups met the safety primary endpoint and showed slowing/prevention of disease worsening relative to placebo. There were statistically significant improvements in the secondary efficacy endpoint, composite AD score CADS for both the low-dose Lomecel-B TM group and the pooled treatment groups compared to placebo. Other doses also indicated promising results in slowing/prevention of disease worsening. Additionally, a statistically significant improvement versus placebo was observed in the Montreal cognitive assessment MoCA and in the activity of daily living observed by a caregiver and measured by Alzheimer s disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living ADCS-ADL ). The study indicated potential preservation of brain volumes in some but not all AD related areas of brain. Brain magnetic resonance imaging ("MRI") results demonstrated a 49 reduction in brain volume loss and improvement in cerebral blood flow. 
 The results of the CLEAR MIND trial were accepted for oral presentation in the Featured Research Session at the 2024 Alzheimer s Association International Conference AAIC in July 2024. The MRI results from this trial also were accepted for poster presentation at AAIC. These findings support both the safety and potential therapeutic benefit of Lomecel-B TM in managing mild AD, and we believe lays the groundwork for subsequent trials in this indication. Based on these results, the FDA granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapeutics (RMAT) Designation on July 9, 2024, and Fast Track designation on July 17, 2024, to Lomecel-B for the treatment of mild AD.

Aging-related Frailty 
 Improvement of the quality of life for the aging population is one of the strategic directions of the Company. Life expectancy has substantially increased over the past century due to medical and public health advancements. However, this longevity increase has not been paralleled by health span the period of time one can expect to live in relatively good health and independence. For many developed and developing countries, health span lags life-expectancy by over a decade. This has placed tremendous strain on healthcare systems in the management of aging-related ailments and presents additional socioeconomic consequences due to a patient s decreased independence and quality-of-life. Since these strains continue to increase with demographic shifts towards an increasingly older population, improving health span has become a priority for health agencies, such as the National Institute on Aging NIA of the National Institutes of Health NIH ), the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency PMDA ), and the European Medicines Agency EMA ). As we age, we experience a decline in our own stem cells, a decrease in immune system function (known as immunosenescence ), diminished blood vessel functioning, chronic inflammation (known as inflammaging ), and other aging-related alterations that affect biological functioning. Our preliminary clinical data suggest that Lomecel-B may potentially address these problems through multiple potential mechanisms of action MOAs that simultaneously target key aging-related processes. We are using Lomecel-B in registry trials in The Bahamas as part of the real-world data generation for the aging population. 
 Summary of Clinical Development Strategy 
 Our core strategy is to become a world-leading regenerative medicine company through the development, approval, and commercialization of novel cell therapy products for unmet medical needs, with a focus on HLHS. Key elements of our current business strategy are as follows. 
 Execution of ELPIS II, a Phase 2b randomized controlled trial set forth in greater detail below, to measure the efficacy of Lomecel-B in HLHS. This trial is ongoing and is being conducted in collaboration with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute NHLBI through grants from the NIH. 

Continue to pursue the therapeutic potential of Lomecel-B in mild AD. We completed a Phase 2a trial, the CLEAR MIND Trial ), which demonstrated the potential benefits of Lomecel-B over placebo to maintain cognitive function and slow deterioration of brain structure atrophy, with no safety issues observed. Specifically, the safety primary endpoint was met, and the trial demonstrated a statistical significance in the secondary CADS endpoint. Overall, in Lomecel-B groups, brain MRI demonstrated whole brain volume loss slowed accompanied by significant preservation of left hippocampal volume relative to placebo. We plan to continue to analyze the data in order to further develop our clinical development strategy. Our objective is to forge strategic collaborations, consider potential partnerships, or pursue other available pathways or opportunities for the advancement of Lomecel-B in addressing AD. 

Limited focus on our international program. In line with the Company s strategic direction for 2024 and moving forward to focus on HLHS and AD as set forth previously, the Company has discontinued its clinical trial in Japan to evaluate Lomecel-B for Aging-related Frailty. The Company will continue to enroll patients on the Frailty and Cognitive Impairment registry trials in The Bahamas and plans to also launch an Osteoarthritis registry trial. 

Expand our manufacturing capabilities to commercial-scale production. We operate a current good manufacturing practice cGMP )-compliant manufacturing facility and produce our own product candidates for testing. We continue to improve and expand our capabilities with the goal of achieving cost-effective manufacturing that may potentially satisfy future commercial demand for certain potential Lomecel-B commercialization opportunities. 

Collaborative arrangements and out-licensing opportunities. We will be opportunistic and consider entering into co-development, out-licensing, or other collaboration agreements for the purpose of eventually commercializing Lomecel-B and other products domestically and internationally if appropriate approvals are obtained. 

Product candidate development pipeline through internal research and development, and in-licensing. Through our research and development program, and through strategic in-licensing agreements, or other business development arrangements, we intend to actively explore promising potential additions to our pipeline. 

Continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio. Our intellectual property is vitally important to our business strategy, and we have taken and continue to take significant steps to develop this property and protect its value. Results from our ongoing research and development efforts are intended to add to our existing intellectual property portfolio.

Clinical Development Pipeline in 2024 
 We are currently in clinical development of a single product, Lomecel-B for three potential indications: 
 
 Figure 1: Lomecel-B clinical development pipeline 

Not currently active for 2024 
 Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) . The FDA granted Lomecel-B for the treatment of HLHS a Rare Pediatric Disease RPD Designation (on November 8, 2021), Orphan Drug Designation ODD (on December 2, 2021), and Fast Track Designation (on August 24, 2022). HLHS is a rare congenital heart condition affecting approximately 1,000 newborns in the US annually. HLHS is a birth defect that affects normal blood flow through the heart. As the baby develops during pregnancy, the left side of the heart does not form correctly so that babies are born with a single ventricle. It is one type of congenital heart defect present at birth. Because a baby with this defect needs surgery or other procedures soon after birth, HLHS is considered a critical congenital heart defect. To prevent certain death shortly after birth, these babies undergo a series of three heart surgeries (staged surgical palliation) that reconfigures the single RV) to support systemic circulation. Despite these life-saving surgeries, HLHS patients nevertheless still have high early mortality and morbidity rates due primarily to heart failure. 
 We are currently conducting a Phase 2b clinical trial (ELPIS II) under FDA IND 017677. ELPIS II is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate Lomecel-B as an adjunct therapy to the standard-of-care second-stage HLHS heart reconstructive surgery which is typically performed at 4-6 months after birth. The primary objective is to evaluate change in right ventricular ejection fraction after Lomecel-B treatment versus standard-of-care surgery alone (38 subjects total: 19 per arm) at 12 months. This trial is more than 80 enrolled and is funded in part by the NHLBI/NIH. Enrollment completion is currently targeted for the end of 2024. However, given the relatively small patient population, clinical trial enrollment timing for rare diseases like HLHS is difficult to predict and full enrollment may occur in the first quarter of 2025. 
 ELPIS II is a next-step trial to our completed 10-patient open-label Phase 1 trial (ELPIS I) under the same IND. This Phase 1 trial was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Lomecel-B as an adjunct to the second-stage HLHS surgery, and to obtain preliminary evidence of Lomecel-B s effect to support a next-phase trial. The primary safety endpoint was met: no major adverse cardiac events MACE or treatment-related infections during the first month post-treatment, and no triggering of stopping rules. Furthermore, fluid-based and imaging biomarker data supported multiple potentially relevant mechanisms-of-action of Lomecel-B , and the potential to improve post-surgical heart function. In addition to the 12-month follow-up evaluation on ELPIS, we continue to follow these patients on an annual basis for the survival status As of September 2024, all 10 patients have survived (100 ), seven of the patients have reached the age of five and have successfully undergone the third-stage surgery, and two of them have reached the age of six years old, all without the need for a heart transplantation. Based on historical data, the incidence of interstage attrition between the Glenn operation (Stage 2) and Fontan (Stage 3) ranges from 6 to 12 with the most common cause of death being RV dysfunction. Longer-term follow-up studies showed that the transplant-free survival to age 15 is only approximately 50 in these patients. 
 We have filed patent applications relating to the administration of mesenchymal stem cells for treating HLHS in Australia, the Bahamas, Canada, China, the European Patent Office, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States. 
 Alzheimer s disease . AD, a devastating neurologic disease leading to cognitive decline, currently has limited therapeutic options. An estimated 6.7 million Americans aged 65 and older have AD, and this number is projected to more than double by 2060. Lomecel-B treated patients showed an overall slowing/prevention of disease worsening compared to placebo in the completed Phase 2a study (CLEAR MIND Trial) as previously detailed in this report and met its primary endpoint of safety. These results are consistent with those of our earlier Phase I study 2 . Based on these results, the FDA granted RMAT Designation and Fast Track designation to 
 29 

Lomecel-B for the treatment of mild AD. As previously indicated, we intend to forge strategic collaborations, consider potential partnerships, or pursue other available pathways or opportunities for the advancement of Lomecel-B in addressing AD.

We have filed patent applications relating to the treatment of AD using mesenchymal stem cells in Australia, the Bahamas, Canada, China, the European Patent Office, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, South Africa, and the United States. 
 Aging-related Frailty . Aging-related Frailty is a life-threatening geriatric condition that disproportionately increases risks for poor clinical outcomes from disease and injury. While the definition of Aging-related Frailty lacks consensus, would be a new indication from a regulatory standpoint, and has no approved pharmaceutical or biologic treatments, there are a number of companies now working to develop potential therapeutics for this unmet medical need. 
 We have previously completed two U.S. clinical trials under FDA IND 016644. One is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial which showed that a single infusion of Lomecel-B significantly improved 6-Minute Walk Test 6MWT distance 9 months after infusion (although results were inconclusive at six months after infusion), and also showed a dose-dependent increase in 6MWT distance 6 months after infusion. The second is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 trial HERA Trial intended primarily to evaluate safety, and explore the effect Lomecel-B may have on specific biomarkers of immune system function in older, frail individuals receiving the high dose influenza vaccine, as well as to evaluate the potential effects of Lomecel-B on signs and symptoms of Aging-related Frailty. Results from this study showed that Lomecel-B was generally safe and well tolerated in patients with Aging-related Frailty. Additionally, hemagglutinin inhibition HAI assay results in the Lomecel-B and placebo groups to influenza were not statistically different, indicating Lomecel-B does not suppress the immune system. 
 We have filed patent applications relating to the administration of MSC for Aging-related Frailty in Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Office, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, New Zealand, South Africa, Taiwan, the Bahamas and United States. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We have generated revenue from three sources: 
 Grant awards. Extramural grant award funding, which is non-dilutive, has been a core strategy for supporting our ongoing clinical research. Since 2016 our clinical programs have received over 16.0 million in competitive extramural grant awards 11.5 million which has been directly awarded to us and which are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations are met) from the National Institutes of Health, Alzheimer s Association, and Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund. 

The Bahamas Registry Trials. Participants in The Bahamas Registry Trials pay us a fee to receive Lomecel-B , imported into The Bahamas, and administered at one of two private medical clinics in Nassau. While Lomecel-B is considered an investigational product in The Bahamas, under the approval terms received from the National Stem Cell Ethics Committee, we are permitted to charge a fee for participation in the Registry Trial. The fee is recognized as revenue and is used to pay for the costs associated with manufacturing and testing of Lomecel-B , administration, shipping and importation fees, data collection and management, biological sample collection and sample processing for biomarkers and other data, and overall management of the Registry, including personnel costs. Lomecel-B is considered an investigational treatment in The Bahamas and is not licensed for commercial sale. 

Contract development and manufacturing services. From time to time, we enter into fee-for-service agreements with third parties for our product development and manufacturing capabilities. In February 2024, we entered into our first manufacturing services contract with Secretome Therapeutics. 

30 

Cost of Revenues 
 We record cost of revenues based on expenses directly related to revenue. For grants we record allocated expenses for research and development costs to a grant as a cost of revenues. For the clinical trial revenue, directly related expenses for that program are allocated and accrued as incurred. These expenses are similar to those described under Research and Development Expenses below. For the contract manufacturing, the Company records costs incurred under the contract as cost of revenues. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 730 Research and Development. ASC 730 addresses the proper accounting and reporting for research and development costs. It identifies: 
 1. Those activities that should be identified as research and development; 

2. The elements of costs that should be identified with research and development activities, and the accounting for these costs; and 

3. The financial statement disclosures related to them. 

Research and development include costs such as clinical trial expenses, contracted research and license agreement fees with no alternative future use, supplies and materials, salaries, share-based compensation, employee benefits, property and equipment depreciation and allocation of various corporate costs. We accrue for costs incurred by external service providers, including contract research organizations CROs and clinical investigators, based on estimates of service performed and costs incurred. These estimates include the level of services performed by the third parties, subject enrollment in clinical trials, administrative costs incurred by the third parties, and other indicators of the services completed. Based on the timing of amounts invoiced by service providers, we may also record payments made to those providers as prepaid expenses that will be recognized as expense in future periods as the related services are rendered. 
 We currently do not carry any inventory for our product candidates, as we have yet to launch a product for commercial distribution. Historically our operations have focused on conducting clinical trials, product research and development efforts, and improving and refining our manufacturing processes, and accordingly, manufactured clinical doses of product candidates were expensed as incurred, consistent with the accounting for all other research and development costs. Once we begin commercial distribution, all newly manufactured approved products will be allocated either for use in commercial distribution, which will be carried as inventory and not expensed, or for research and development efforts, which will continue to be expensed as incurred. 
 We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to be significant in the future as we increase our headcount to support increased research and development activities relating to our clinical programs, as well as incur additional expenses related to our clinical trials. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include public company related expenses; Board of Director fees; legal fees relating to corporate matters; insurance costs; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs. General and administrative costs also include royalty and license fees associated with our agreements with the University of Miami as well as attending and sponsoring industry, investment, organization and medical conferences and events. 
 Other Income 
 Interest income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities. We expect our interest income to vary in conjunction with changes in our monthly cash and marketable securities balances. Other income consists of funds earned that are not part of our normal operations. In past years they have been primarily a result of tax refunds received for social security taxes as part of a research and development tax credit program. 
 31 

Income Taxes 
 No provision for income taxes has been recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. We may incur income taxes in the future if we have earnings. At this time the Company has not evaluated the impact of any future profits.

Revenues, Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit: Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.8 million and 0.2 million, respectively. This represents an increase of 0.6 million, or 415 , in 2024 compared to 2023, driven primarily by an increased participant demand for our Bahamas Registry Trial and the addition of our manufacturing services contract. 
 
 Clinical trial revenue from the Bahamas Registry Trial, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.2 million and 0.1 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of 0.1 million, or 40 , due to increased participant demand. Contract manufacturing revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.6 million, generated from our manufacturing services contract. 
 Related cost of revenues was 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This resulted in a gross profit of approximately 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.6 million, or greater than 100 , compared to a gross profit of less than 0.1 million in 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to approximately 3.1 million, compared to 3.3 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease of approximately 0.2 million, or 7 , was primarily due to lower legal and other administrative expenses, partially offset by higher stock compensation costs in 2024. 
 Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to approximately 2.2 million from approximately 1.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of 0.4 million, or 20 , was primarily due to 0.5 million of higher compensation and benefit costs and 0.3 million in additional equity-based compensation expenses allocated to research and development expenses. These increases were partially offset by a 0.6 million 
 32 

decrease in expenses related to the now-completed CLEAR MIND Alzheimer s disease clinical trial, as well as reduced costs for the Aging-related frailty clinical trial following our decision to discontinue trial activities in Japan.

Revenues, Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit: Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.8 million and 0.6 million, respectively. This represents an increase of 1.1 million, or 177 , in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by increased participant demand for our Bahamas Registry Trial and our manufacturing services contract. 
 
 Clinical trial revenue, derived from the Bahamas Registry Trial, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1.0 million and 0.6 million, respectively. This increase of 0.4 million, or 67 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to higher participant demand. Contract manufacturing revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.8 million, generated from our manufacturing services contract. 
 Related cost of revenues was 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This resulted in a gross profit of approximately 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.1 million, or 506 , compared to a gross profit of 0.2 million in 2023. 
 33 

General and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to approximately 7.4 million, compared to 8.9 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease of approximately 1.5 million, or 16 , was primarily due to lower personnel expenses as a result of reduced severance, legal and other administrative expenses, partially offset by higher stock compensation costs in 2024. 
 Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to approximately 6.1 million, from approximately 6.9 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease of 0.8 million, or 11 , was primarily driven by a reduction of 1.8 million in expenses related to the completed CLEAR MIND Alzheimer s disease clinical trial, reduced costs for the Aging-related frailty clinical trial following our decision to discontinue trial activities in Japan, and a 0.4 million decrease in supply costs. These reductions were partially offset by 1.1 million in higher compensation and benefit costs and a 0.2 million increase in equity-based compensation expenses allocated to research and development . Research and development expenses consisted primarily of the following items (less those expenses allocated to the cost of revenues for the grants) (in thousands):

Operating Activities . We have incurred losses since inception. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.5 million, consisting primarily of our net loss of 11.9 million and payments of 0.2 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, and 0.7 million for accrued expenses. This was partially offset by non-cash expenses of 1.9 million for equity-based compensation and 0.7 million for depreciation and amortization. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 15.0 million, consisting primarily of our net loss of 15.4 million, payments of 0.6 million in prepaid and other assets and non-operating lawsuit of 1.4 million. This was partially offset by non-cash expenses of 1.6 million in equity-based compensation expenses, 0.7 million in depreciation and amortization, and an increase in accrued expenses of 0.8 million. 
 Investing Activities . Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.5 million consisting primarily of the purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets, which was partially offset by the redemption of 
 34 

marketable securities. Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 6.6 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. 
 Financing Activities . Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 28.8 million for proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 12.9 million and warrants exercised of 16.2 million, which was partially offset by the payment of taxes upon vesting of RSUs. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.2 million for the payment of taxes upon vesting of RSUs. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our programs. We expect that our sales, research and development and general and administrative costs will increase in connection with conducting additional preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future programs and product candidates, contracting with CROs to support preclinical studies and clinical trials, expanding our intellectual property portfolio, and providing general and administrative support for our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other sources. 
 To date, we have financed our operations primarily through our IPO, public and privately placed equity financings, grant awards, and fees generated from the Bahamas Registry Trial and contract manufacturing services. Since we were formed, we have raised approximately 132.2 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of equity. At September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 22.8 million and working capital of approximately 20.7 million. 
 Following the capital raises from a registered direct offering and warrant exercises in July 2024 as well as an inducement transaction in September 2024, as detailed below in the section entitled Capital Raising Efforts , which resulted in gross proceeds of 15.4 million and net proceeds of 14.0 million after deducting placement agent fees and other deductions for offering expenses as discussed below, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the fourth quarter of 2025 based on our current operating budget and cash flow forecast. However, as a result of our successful Type C meeting with the U.S. FDA in August 2024 with respect to the HLHS regulatory pathway, we have started to ramp up Biologics License Application (BLA) enabling activities as we currently anticipate a potential filing with the FDA in 2026 if the current ELPIS II trial is successful. To the extent that our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements accelerate in calendar 2025 as a result of these activities, including CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls) and manufacturing readiness, there will be a need to increase our current proposed spend and further increase our capital investments. We intend to seek additional financing/capital raises/non-dilutive funding options to support these activities, and current cash projections may be impacted by these ramped up activities and any financing transactions entered into. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We are actively seeking financing opportunities to extend our cash runaway while taking measures to reduce our cash expenditures as we focus our resources on our primary strategic program in HLHS. These cost saving measures include the discontinuation of our Aging-related Frailty clinical trial in Japan, related staff reductions, and continued prudent management of discretionary spend. 
 Capital Raising Efforts 
 On July 10, 2024, certain holders of the June Inducement Warrants exercised the same to purchase an aggregate of 150,000 shares of Class A common stock for cash (the July 10 warrant exercise ). Accordingly, on July 17, 2024, we issued to the placement agent additional warrants to purchase up to 10,500 shares of Class A common stock, equal to 7.0 of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock issued in the July 10 warrant exercise (the first tranche July ordinary course placement agent warrants ). The first tranche July ordinary course placement agent warrants have substantially the same terms as the private placement agent warrants issued in June, except that the first tranche July ordinary course placement agent warrants have an exercise price of 3.125 per share and expire July 17, 2026. Separately, on July 10, 2024, a holder of Series C Warrants issued in an April 24 inducement letter agreement transaction exercised the same for 50,000 shares of common stock for cash (the "July Series C warrant exercise"). 
 On July 17, 2024, holders of the June Inducement Warrants exercised June Inducement Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,319,186 shares of Class A common stock for cash (the July 17 warrant exercise and together with the July Series C warrant exercise and the July 10 warrant exercise, collectively, the July warrant exercises ). Accordingly, on July 24, 2024, we issued to the placement agent additional warrants to purchase up to 162,344 shares of Class A common stock, equal to 7.0 of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock issued in the July 17 warrant exercise (the second tranche July ordinary course placement agent warrants , and together with the first tranche July ordinary course placement agent warrants, the July ordinary course placement agent warrants , and collectively with the July transaction placement agent warrants, the July placement agent warrants ). 
 35 

The second tranche July ordinary course placement agent warrants have substantially the same terms as the first tranche July ordinary course placement agent warrants, except that the second tranche July ordinary course placement agent warrants expire July 24, 2026. 
 The gross proceeds to the Company from the July warrant exercises, inclusive of the payment consideration for such warrants, were approximately 6.3 million, before deducting placement agent fees payable by the Company. 
 On July 18, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with institutional and accredited investors relating to the registered direct offering and sale of an aggregate of 2,236,026 shares of our Class A common stock at a purchase price of 4.025 per share of Class A common stock and associated warrant (the July registered direct offering ). The securities issued in the July registered direct offering were offered pursuant to a prospectus supplement, dated July 18, 2024, and accompanying prospectus, in connection with a takedown from our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-264142), which was declared effective by the SEC on April 14, 2022. 
 In a concurrent private placement (the July private placement and together with the July registered direct offering, the July offering ), we also sold unregistered Class A common stock warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,236,026 shares of our Class A common stock (the July private placement warrants ). The unregistered July private placement warrants have an exercise price of 3.90 per share, became exercisable on July 19, 2024, and expire on July 20, 2026. Additionally the Company agreed to issue to the placement agent, or its designees, warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 156,522 shares of Class A common stock (the July offering placement agent warrants ), equal to 7.0 of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock sold in the offering, which have substantially the same terms as the unregistered July private placement warrants, except that the July offering placement agent warrants have an exercise price of 5.0313 per share. 
 The gross proceeds to the Company from the July offering were approximately 9.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. 
 In September 2024, the Company entered into additional inducement letter agreements with certain holders of its existing Purchaser Warrants issued as part of the Company s 2021 private placement offering to amend and reduce the exercise price of the Purchaser Warrants to 1.00 per share in consideration for the holders cash exercise of all Purchaser Warrants held by such holder on or before September 27, 2024. In connection with the September 2024 inducement transaction, Purchaser Warrants were exercised for 114,077 shares of Class A common stock, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of 114,077. 
 Grant Awards 
 From inception through December 31, 2023, we have been awarded approximately 11.9 million in governmental and non-profit association grants, which have been used to fund our clinical trials, research and development, production and overhead. Grant awards are recognized as revenue, and depending on the funding mechanism, are deposited directly in our accounts as lump sums, which are staggered over a predetermined period or drawn down from a federal payment management system account for reimbursement of expenses incurred. Revenue recognition occurs when the grant related expenses are incurred or supplies and materials are received. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the amount of unused grant funds that were available for us to draw was approximately 0.1 million. 
 Terms and Conditions of Grant Awards 
 Grant projects are typically divided into periods (e.g., a three-year grant may have three one-year periods), and the total amount awarded is divided according to the number of periods. At pre-specified time points, which are detailed in the grant award notifications, we are required to submit interim financial and scientific reports to the granting agency totaling funds spent, and in some cases, detailing use of proceeds and progress made during the reporting period. After funding the initial period, receipt of additional grant funds is contingent upon satisfactory submission of our interim reports to the granting agency. 
 Grant awards arise from submitting detailed research proposals to granting agencies, and winning a highly competitive and rigorous application review and process that is judged on the merits of the proposal. There are typically multiple applicants applying and competing for a finite amount of funds. As such we cannot be sure that we will be awarded grant funds in the future despite our past success in receiving such awards. 
 Funding Requirements 
 Our operating costs will continue to be substantial for the foreseeable future in connection with our ongoing activities. In past years we have been able to fund a large portion of our clinical programs and our administrative overhead with the use of grant funding. 
 36 

Specifically, our expenses will increase as we: 
 advance the clinical development of Lomecel-B for the treatment of several disease states and indications; 

pursue the preclinical and clinical development of other current and future research programs and product candidates; 

in-license or acquire the rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; 

maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

hire additional personnel in research, manufacturing and regulatory and clinical development as well as management personnel; 

seek regulatory approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical development; and 

expand our operational, financial and management systems and increase personnel, including personnel to support our operations as a public company. 

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the fourth quarter of 2025 based on our current operating budget and cash flow forecast. However, as a result of our successful Type C meeting with the U.S. FDA in August 2024 with respect to the HLHS regulatory pathway, we have started to ramp up Biologics License Application (BLA) enabling activities as we currently anticipate a potential filing with the FDA in 2026 if the current ELPIS II trial is successful. To the extent that our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements accelerate in calendar 2025 as a result of these activities, including CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls) and manufacturing readiness, there will be a need to increase our current proposed spend and further increase our capital investments. We intend to seek additional financing/capital raises/non-dilutive funding options to support these activities, and current cash projections may be impacted by these ramped up activities and any financing transactions entered into. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We are actively seeking financing opportunities to extend our cash runaway while taking measures to reduce our cash expenditures as we focus our resources on our primary strategic program in HLHS. These cost saving measures include the discontinuation of our Aging-related Frailty clinical trial in Japan, related staff reductions, and continued prudent management of discretionary spend. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of our product candidates, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the progress, costs and results of our clinical trials for our programs for our cell-based therapies, and additional research and preclinical studies in other research programs we initiate in the future; 

the costs and timing of process development and manufacturing scale-up activities associated with our product candidates and other programs we advance through preclinical and clinical development; 

our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other agreements and the financial terms of such agreements; 

the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; and 

the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against any intellectual property-related claims. 

Further, our operating results may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans. Until such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, grant awards, collaboration agreements, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and marketing and distribution arrangements. 
 We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our biologic drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 37 

In order to meet our operational goals, we will need to obtain additional capital, which we will likely obtain through a variety of means, including through public or private equity, debt financings or other sources, including up-front payments and milestone payments from strategic collaborations. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of convertible debt or equity securities, current stockholder ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, and may result in imposition of debt covenants, increased fixed payment obligations or other restrictions that may affect our business. If we raise additional funds through up-front payments or milestone payments pursuant to strategic collaborations with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have 1.6 million in operating lease obligations and 0 in contract research organization obligations due to the termination of our active master services agreements with third parties that were previously engaged to conduct its clinical trials and manage clinical research programs and clinical development services. This termination was due to the Company s decision to discontinue trial activities in Japan. We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third-party contract organizations for clinical trials, preclinical studies, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination following a certain period after notice and therefore we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material. 
 We have not included milestone or royalty payments or other contractual payment obligations if the timing and amount of such obligations are unknown or uncertain. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition in Part II, Item 7 and the notes to our financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of our 2023 Form 10-K. See also Note 1 to the condensed financial statements. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates since the filing of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, which is a law intended to encourage funding of small businesses in the U.S. by easing many of the country s securities regulations, and we may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with those standards. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards; and as a result of this election, our condensed financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. The JOBS Act also exempts us from having to provide an auditor attestation of internal control over financial reporting under Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b). 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.07 billion or more, (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (3) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which generally is when a company has more than 700 million in market value of its reported class of stock held by non-affiliates and has been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed at least one Annual Report on Form 10-K.
