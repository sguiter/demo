Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report, and the Company undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise such forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Such forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates based upon current information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Actual events or results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors. While it is impossible to identify all such factors, factors which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those estimated by the Company include, but are not limited to, our ability to execute on our strategic plans; regulatory and other developments impacting the markets for our services; changes in reimbursement rates; general economic conditions; changes in the episodic versus non-episodic mix of our payors, the case mix of our patients, and payment methodologies; our ability to attract and retain key management personnel and healthcare professionals; potential disruptions or breaches of our or our vendors , payors , and other contract counterparties information systems; the outcome of litigation; our ability to successfully complete and integrate de novo locations, acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures; the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton on our operations; and our ability to control costs, particularly labor and employee benefit costs.

 Separation from Encompass 
 On July 1, 2022, Encompass completed the separation of the Company through the distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value per share, of Enhabit to the stockholders of record of Encompass (the Distribution ). As a result of the Distribution, Enhabit is now an independent public company, and its common stock is listed under the symbol EHAB on the New York Stock Exchange (the Separation ). 
 The Separation was completed pursuant to a separation and distribution agreement (the Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements with Encompass related to the Separation, including, but not limited to, a tax matters agreement (the Tax Matters Agreement ), an employee matters agreement (the Employee Matters Agreement ), and a transition services agreement (the Transition Services Agreement or TSA ). Following the Separation, certain functions were provided by Encompass under the TSA. As of April 1, 2024, these functions are being performed using the Company s own resources or third party providers. 
 In early 2022, in anticipation of the Distribution, we transferred the Encompass trade name with a book value of million and the related deferred tax liabilities with a book value of million to Encompass, as they will continue to operate under the Encompass brand.

 reporting units should be performed. These triggering events included a decrease in our share price and market capitalization. Based on the quantitative analysis performed in the third quarter of 2024, we recorded an impairment charge of million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to reflect a decrease in the carrying value of our home health reporting unit. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the home health reporting unit had an allocated goodwill balance of million and million, respectively. The fair value of the hospice reporting unit as of September 30, 2024 exceeded its carrying value by less than . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the hospice reporting unit had an allocated goodwill balance of million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we identified potential impairment triggering events during the second quarter and determined a quantitative analysis of our reporting units should be performed. These triggering events included our performance against the 2023 forecast, a decrease in our share price and market capitalization, and the release of the 2024 proposed rule for home health on June 30, 2023, which included a net negative home health payment update. Based on the quantitative analysis in the second quarter of 2023, we recorded an impairment charge of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to reflect a decrease in the carrying value of our hospice reporting unit. impairment charge was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The cumulative impairments to our goodwill totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 We estimated the fair value of our reporting units using both the income approach and the market approach. The assumptions used in the income approach incorporate a number of significant estimates and judgments, including revenue growth rates, timing of de novo openings, forecasted operating margins, the weighted-average cost of capital, and terminal

 In June 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement that consists of a million term loan A facility (the Term Loan A Facility and a million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility and together with the Term Loan A Facility, the Credit Facilities ). The Credit Facilities mature in June 2027. Interest on the loans under the Credit Facilities is calculated by reference to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable interest rate margin. Enhabit may voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to SOFR loans. The Term Loan A Facility contains customary mandatory prepayments, including with respect to proceeds from asset sales and from certain incurrences of indebtedness. 
 On June 30, 2022, we drew the full million of the Term Loan A Facility and million on the Revolving Credit Facility. The net proceeds of million were distributed to Encompass prior to the completion of the Distribution. For additional information on the Separation, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 The Term Loan A Facility amortizes by an amount per annum equal to of the outstanding principal amount thereon as of the closing date, payable in equal quarterly installments, with the balance being payable in June 2027. The Revolving Credit Facility provides the ability to borrow and obtain letters of credit, which is subject to a million

to 1.00; (ii) changes to the conditions concerning the Company s total net leverage ratio that must be met for the Company to borrow incremental ratio-based amounts; (iii) an increase in the maximum permitted total net leverage ratio to to 1.00 for the quarters ending June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2023, stepping down to to 1.00 for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, to 1.00 for the quarter ending June 30, 2024, and to 1.00 for the quarter ending September 30, 2024 and thereafter; and (iv) modifications to the Company s ability to declare and make certain restricted payments. 
 On September 29, 2023, we entered into a Limited Waiver (the Waiver with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent to the other lenders (the Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement and the First Amendment. The Waiver released the Company from the requirement to comply with the total net leverage ratio and the interest coverage ratio covenants for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Waiver also required that, until such time as the Company certified compliance with the waived financial covenants, the aggregate principal amount of the Company s revolving loans allowed under the Credit Agreement was decreased from million to million. All other covenants and terms of the Credit Agreement remained unchanged and in effect. Although we were not required to be in compliance with the financial covenants as of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Facilities. 
 As of September 30, 2023, our forecasted results suggested there was uncertainty of meeting our covenants through a period of one year from the issuance date of the September 30, 2023 financial statements. As a result, on November 3, 2023, we amended the Credit Facilities (the Second Amendment to provide for, among other things, (i) an increase in the maximum permitted Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to to 1.00 for the quarters ending December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, stepping down to to 1.00 for the quarters ending June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2024, to 1.00 for the quarter ending March 31, 2025, and to 1.00 for the quarter ending June 30, 2025 and thereafter; (ii) the addition of a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) covenant of to 1.00 until the end of the Covenant Adjustment Period (as defined below); (iii) no Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) covenant until the end of the Covenant Adjustment Period; (iv) a permanent reduction in the Revolving Credit Facility commitment from million to million; (v) an increase in the Applicable Commitment Fee (as defined in the Credit Agreement) during the Covenant Adjustment Period; (vi) suspension of the ability of the Company to request incremental commitments under the Credit Agreement during the Covenant Adjustment Period; (vii) an increase of in the applicable interest rate margins on amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement during the Covenant Adjustment Period; (viii) limits on the amount of cash the Company can keep on hand and outside the lender group during the Covenant Adjustment Period; and (ix) additional limits on permitted indebtedness and acquisitions, permitted liens, restricted payments and permitted investments during the Covenant Adjustment Period. The Covenant Adjustment Period begins on the date of the Second Amendment and ends on the earlier of (a) the date that the Company provides evidence of compliance with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement, as amended, for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2025 and (b) the date that the Company provides evidence of compliance with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the First Amendment for the applicable quarter. 
 Under specified circumstances, including non-compliance with any of the covenants described above and the unavailability of any waiver, amendment or other modification thereto, we may not be able to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, violation of the covenants would result in an event of default under the Credit Facilities. A default that occurs, and is not cured within any applicable cure period or is not waived, would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under the Credit Facilities and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt.

 5.) and ) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These rates differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to permanent differences attributable to the impairment of goodwill in the third quarter of 2024 and a valuation allowance. On a quarterly basis, we assess all available positive and negative evidence, and we recognize only the portion of our deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a valuation allowance of million against a portion of our deferred tax assets.

The following is a brief description of our reportable segments: 
 Home Health Our home health operations represent the nation s fourth-largest provider of Medicare-certified skilled home health services, measured by 2022 Medicare revenues. As of September 30, 2024, we operated home health locations in states, with a concentration in the southern half of the United States. We are the sole owner of of these locations. We retain to ownership in the remaining jointly owned locations. Our home health services include a comprehensive range of Medicare-certified home health nursing services to adult patients in need of care. These services include, among others, skilled nursing, physical, occupational, and speech therapy, medical social work, and home health aide services. 
 Hospice Our hospice operations represent one of the nation s largest providers of Medicare-certified hospice services, measured by 2022 Medicare revenues. As of September 30, 2024, we operated hospice locations in states, with a concentration in the southern half of the United States. We are the sole owner of of these locations. We retain to ownership in the remaining jointly owned locations. Hospice care focuses on the quality of life for patients who are experiencing an advanced, life limiting illness while treating the person and symptoms of the disease, rather than the disease itself. 
 The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K. All revenues for our services are generated through external customers. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Net Service Revenue , for the disaggregation of our revenues. No corporate overhead is allocated to either of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of our segments and allocates resources to them based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization Segment Adjusted EBITDA ). Segment assets are not reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer and therefore are not disclosed below.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements (Unaudited), of this report. Among other things, those historical financial statements include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the financial data included in the following discussion. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and industry that involve risks and uncertainties, as described under the section titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a leading provider of home health and hospice services in the United States. We strive to provide superior, cost-effective care where patients prefer it: in their homes. For over twenty years, we have provided care in the low-cost home setting while achieving high-quality clinical outcomes. Over that time, we have grown to become the fourth largest provider of home health services and a leading provider of hospice services nationally, measured by 2022 Medicare revenues. As of September 30, 2024, our footprint comprised 256 home health locations and 112 hospice locations across 34 states. 
 Our operations are principally managed on a services basis and include two operating segments for financial reporting purposes: (1) home health and (2) hospice. For additional information about our business and reportable segments, see Item 1, Business , and Item 1A, Risk Factors , in the Company s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 on Form 10-K (the Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 15, 2024 and Note 8, Segment Reporting , to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and Segment Results of Operations section of this item. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 Termination of UnitedHealth Group Contract 
 In August 2024, the Company provided a notice of termination under its national contract with UnitedHealth Group United ), which has less favorable payment terms than most of the Company s other payor contracts. The termination will become effective on January 31, 2025 unless the parties negotiate a new agreement. 
 As previously disclosed, one of our primary growth strategies has been to shift business to Medicare Advantage contracts that pay us at improved rates. We have been successful in recent quarters shifting admissions to alternate payors with improved rates, and due to our termination notice in the third quarter, we shifted additional volumes away from United. 
 Since delivery of our termination notice, we have maintained an ongoing dialogue and negotiation with United, but we have not yet executed a new agreement. If we cannot negotiate a new agreement, we believe we will be able to continue to replace United revenue with revenue from other payors, but there can be no assurance this will happen or how quickly we will be able to complete the shift. 
 Impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton 
 Certain of our home health operations in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina were impacted by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall on September 26, 2024, and Hurricane Milton, which made landfall on October 9, 2024 (the Hurricanes ). While admissions and visits in branches located in areas impacted by the Hurricanes have substantially recovered, we do not anticipate being able to replace a material portion of 2024 admissions and visits lost due to the Hurricanes. 
 Our operations were primarily affected by reduced home health admissions resulting from the displacement of employees, patients, and referral sources, and the postponement of procedures resulting in lower Net service revenue due to lost visits and reduced admissions. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Hurricane Helene did not have a material impact on our operations; however, for the three months and year ending December 31, 2024, we estimate lost Net service revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately 2 million from the impact of the Hurricanes. 
 18 

Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 There are a number of factors that have impacted, and we believe will continue to impact, our results of operations and growth. These factors include: 
 Pricing 
 On July 30, 2024, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS issued its final rule for hospice payments for fiscal year 2025 (the 2025 Hospice Final Rule ). Effective October 1, 2024, CMS will implement a 2.9 net increase to reimbursement rates as compared to 2024 reimbursement rates. This update represents a 3.4 update to the market basket, reduced by a 0.5 productivity adjustment. Based on our analysis, which utilizes, among other things, our patient mix annualized over the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024, our specific geographic coverage area, and other factors, we believe the 2025 Hospice Final Rule will result in a net increase to our Medicare payment rates of approximately 4 effective f or services provided beginning October 1, 2024. 
 On November 1, 2024, CMS issued its final rule for home health payments for fiscal year 2025 (the 2025 Home Health Final Rule ). CMS proposed a 0.5 estimated net increase to payments as compared to 2024 payments. This update represents a 2.7 update to the home health payment, reduced by a 1.8 permanent behavior adjustment and a 0.4 decrease that represents an adjustment to the fixed dollar loss ratio for outlier payments. We are currently evaluating the impact the 2025 Home Health Final Rule will have on our operations. 
 For further discussion of other pricing factors that impact our results of operations and growth, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in the Form 10-K. 
 Volume 
 The volume of services we provide has a significant impact on our Net service revenue . For a discussion of factors that impact our ability to maintain and grow our home health and hospice volumes, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in the Form 10-K. 
 Efficiency 
 Cost and operating efficiencies impact the profitability of the patient care services we provide. We use a number of strategies to drive cost and operating efficiencies within our business. We target markets for expansion and growth that allow us to leverage our existing operations to create operating efficiencies through scale and density. We also leverage technology to create operating and supply chain efficiencies throughout our organization. See Item 1, Business Our Competitive Strengths , in the Form 10-K for further discussion of the ways we seek to reduce costs while improving patient outcomes. 
 Recruiting and Retaining High-Quality Personnel 
 Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, including management, for our home health and hospice agencies remains a high priority for us. We attempt to maintain a comprehensive compensation and benefits package to compete in the current challenging staffing environment.

Results of Operations 
 Revenues and expenses are measured in accordance with the policies and procedures described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K. 
 Our consolidated results of operations were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Percentage Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Percentage Change 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 (In Millions, Except Percentage Change) Net service revenue 253.6 258.3 (1.8) 776.6 785.7 (1.2) Cost of service, excluding depreciation and amortization 131.7 134.0 (1.7) 397.7 402.1 (1.1) Gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization 121.9 124.3 (1.9) 378.9 383.6 (1.2) General and administrative expenses 103.8 108.8 (4.6) 321.3 327.1 (1.8) Depreciation and amortization 8.2 7.7 6.5 23.6 23.2 1.7 Impairment of goodwill 107.9 N/A 107.9 85.8 25.8 Operating (loss) income (98.0) 7.8 (1,356.4) (73.9) (52.5) 40.8 Interest expense and amortization of debt discounts and fees 10.8 10.9 (0.9) 32.8 30.7 6.8 Other income (0.1) (100.0) (0.2) (100.0) Loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests (108.8) (3.0) 3,526.7 (106.7) (83.0) 28.6 Income tax expense (benefit) 0.7 (0.8) (187.5) 1.5 (9.9) (115.2) Net loss (109.5) (2.2) 4,877.3 (108.2) (73.1) 48.0 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.7 0.2 250.0 2.0 1.0 100.0 Net loss attributable to Enhabit, Inc. (110.2) (2.4) 4,491.7 (110.2) (74.1) 48.7 
 The following table sets forth our consolidated results as a percentage of Net service revenue : 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Cost of service, excluding depreciation and amortization 51.9 51.9 51.2 51.2 General and administrative expenses 40.9 42.1 41.4 41.6 Depreciation and amortization 3.2 3.0 3.0 3.0 
 Net Service Revenue 
 Net service revenue decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily due to lower Medicare recertifications in home health. 
 Cost of Service, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization 
 Cost of service , excluding depreciation and amortization decreased in terms of dollars during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily due to a reduction in contract labor and favorable experience in workers compensation and group medical claims. Cost of service , excluding depreciation and amortization remained flat as a percentage of Net service revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses decreased in terms of dollars and as a percentage of Net service revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily due to lower incentive compensation and cost control initiatives undertaken in the second half of 2023 and throughout 2024. 
 Impairment of Goodwill 
 Impairment of goodwill during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from a goodwill charge of 107.9 million to reduce the carrying value of our home health reporting unit to its fair value. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Impairment of goodwill resulted from a goodwill charge of 85.8 million to reduce the carrying value of our hospice reporting unit to its fair value. See Note 3, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Interest Expense and Amortization of Debt Discounts and Fees 
 Interest expense and amortization of debt discounts and fees decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to a lower average borrowing level under our credit facilities partially offset by higher average interest rates. 
 Interest expense and amortization of debt discounts and fees increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to higher average interest rates partially offset by a lower average borrowing level under our credit facilities. See additional discussion on Note 4, Long Term Debt, to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources within this item. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 Our effective income tax rate was (0.6) and (1.4) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These rates differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to permanent differences attributable to the impairment of goodwill in the third quarter of 2024 and a valuation allowance. On a quarterly basis, we assess all available positive and negative evidence, and we recognize only the portion of our deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a valuation allowance of 12.0 million against a portion of our deferred tax assets. Of this amount, 3.4 million relates to deferred tax assets arising in a prior year. 
 Our effective income tax rate was 26.7 and 11.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The tax benefit recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was not materially different than the tax benefit calculated at the federal statutory rate. The rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to permanent differences attributable to the impairment of goodwill in the second quarter of 2023. 
 See additional discussion in Note 5, Income Taxes, to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of our financial performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA assists investors in comparing our operating performance across operating periods on a consistent basis by excluding items we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance. 
 We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as Net loss adjusted to exclude (1) interest expense and amortization of debt discounts and fees, (2) income tax expense (benefit), (3) depreciation and amortization, (4) gains or losses on disposal or impairment of assets or goodwill, (5) stock based compensation, (6) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and (7) unusual or nonrecurring items not typical of ongoing operations. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ), and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for Net loss . Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Revenues and expenses are measured in accordance with the policies and procedures described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 The following table reconciles Net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (in millions): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net loss (109.5) (2.2) (108.2) (73.1) Interest expense and amortization of debt discounts and fees 10.8 10.9 32.8 30.7 Income tax expense (benefit) 0.7 (0.8) 1.5 (9.9) Depreciation and amortization 8.2 7.7 23.6 23.2 Gains on disposal of assets (0.3) (0.2) (0.5) (0.2) Impairment of goodwill 107.9 107.9 85.8 Stock-based compensation 3.8 3.1 7.8 7.2 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.7) (0.2) (2.0) (1.0) Unusual or nonrecurring items that are not typical of ongoing operations

 3.6 4.9 12.1 9.8 Other 0.2 0.1 (0.3) Adjusted EBITDA 24.5 23.2 75.0 72.5 
 Unusual or nonrecurring items in the three months ended September 30, 2024 include: (i) third-party legal and advisory fees related to shareholder activism and (ii) restructuring activities and severance costs. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 include: (i) third-party legal and advisory fees related to shareholder activism; (ii) third party legal and advisory fees related to the strategic review process that concluded in May 2024; and (iii) certain third-party, nonrecurring litigation fees related to a lawsuit in which the Company is a plaintiff, styled Enhabit, Inc. et al. v. Nautic Partners IX, L.P., et al . and pending in the Chancery Court of Delaware, and in which the Company has asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting, and usurpation of corporate opportunity arising from actions involving its former officers. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, they include: (i) third party legal fees associated with the suit Enhabit, Inc. et al. v. Nautic Partners IX, L.P., et al . and (ii) third-party legal and advisory fees related to the strategic review process. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 also include third-party legal and advisory fees related to shareholder activism.

With an advanced episodic model added to our Payor Innovation contracts effective January 1, 2024, we have updated how we report volume and pricing metrics for our home health segment, separating traditional Medicare from all other payor contracts. The prior periods were changed to conform to the current period presentation, which had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
 Expenses as a Percentage of Net Service Revenue 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Cost of service, excluding depreciation and amortization 52.7 52.2 51.7 51.4 General and administrative expenses 29.0 28.0 28.2 28.3 
 Net Service Revenue 
 The decrease in home health Net service revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 was primarily due to lower Medicare volume as a result of lower recertifications. 
 Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
 The decrease in home health segment adjusted EBITDA during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in Net service revenue .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of short-term liquidity are our cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. We use these sources to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and to service our debt. See Contractual Obligations for more information about our material cash requirements from our contractual obligations at September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 45.7 million and 27.4 million, respectively, in Cash and cash equivalents . These amounts exclude 1.7 million and 2.4 million, respectively, in Restricted cash . Our Restricted cash pertains primarily to a joint venture in which our joint venture partner requested, and we agreed, the joint venture s cash not be commingled with other corporate cash accounts. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash , to the consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2024, we also had 48.4 million available to us under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 For additional information regarding our debt, see Note 4, Long Term Debt , to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . 
 The following table shows the cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 55.3 45.5 Net cash used in investing activities (2.1) (5.8) Net cash used in financing activities (35.6) (31.7) Increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 17.6 8.0 
 Operating activities . The increase in Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily resulted from changes in working capital. 
 Investing activities . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net cash used in investing activities primarily resulted from the purchases of property and equipment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Net cash used in investing activities primarily resulted from purchases of property and equipment and the Specialty Home Health Care, Inc. acquisition in February 2023. 
 Financing activities . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from repayments of borrowings under our credit facilities.

Our consolidated contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 are as follows (in millions): 
 Total Current Long-Term 
 Long-term debt obligations: Long-term debt, excluding revolving credit facility, finance lease obligations and unamortized debt issuance costs (1) 
 355.0 20.0 335.0 Revolving credit facility 165.0 165.0 Interest on long-term debt (2)

 67.7 14.9 52.8 Purchase obligations (4) 
 6.6 5.4 1.2 Total 718.9 82.2 636.7 
 (1) We lease automobiles for our clinicians under finance leases. Amounts include the interest portion of future minimum finance lease payments. For more information, see Note 6, Leases , to the consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K. 
 (2) Interest on long-term debt was calculated using the rate for the Term Loan A Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 (3) In addition to our corporate headquarters office space, our home health and hospice segments lease: (1) relatively small office spaces in the localities they serve; and (2) equipment in the normal course of business. Amounts include the interest portion of future minimum operating lease payments. For more information, see Note 6, Leases , to the consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K. 
 (4) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Our purchase obligations primarily relate to software licensing and support. Purchase obligations are not recognized in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. For more information, see Note 6, Contingencies and Other Commitments , to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Our capital expenditures include costs associated with computer hardware and licensing software we utilize to run our business, as well as leasehold improvements. During 2024, we expect to spend approximately 5 million to 7 million for capital expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we made capital expenditures of 3.2 million and 3.6 million, respectively, for property and equipment and capitalized software. Actual amounts spent will be dependent upon the timing of projects for our business. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Except for the updates set forth below, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates , in the Form 10 K. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we identified potential impairment triggering events in the quarter and determined a quantitative analysis of our two reporting units should be performed. Based on this quantitative analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of 107.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to reflect a decrease in the carrying value of our home health reporting unit. For additional information regarding our Goodwill , see Note 3, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 As a result of the impairment charge discussed above, we performed a sensitivity analysis by reporting unit and determined that, assuming all other assumptions and inputs used in the discounted cash flow analysis were held constant, a 50 basis point increase for home health and a 100 basis point increase for hospice in the discount rate assumption would result in decreases in the fair value of the Home Health and Hospice reporting units of approximately 35 million and 20 million, respectively. We based our fair value estimates on assumptions management believes to be reasonable but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. 
 26 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our primary exposure to market risk is to changes in interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt. We use sensitivity analysis models to evaluate the impact of interest rate changes on our variable rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, our primary variable rate debt outstanding related to 165.0 million in advances under our Revolving Credit Facility and 355.0 million under our Term Loan A Facility. 
 On October 20, 2022, we entered into an interest rate swap. The interest rate swap has a 200.0 million notional value and a maturity date of October 20, 2025. Beginning in October 2022, we receive the one-month SOFR and pay a fixed rate of interest of 4.3 . The impact of increases and decreases in interest rates on our cash flow discussed below includes the impact of the interest rate swap. 
 Assuming outstanding balances were to remain the same and including the impact of our interest rate swap agreement, a 1 increase in interest rates would result in an incremental negative cash flow of 3.2 million over the next 12 months, while a 1 decrease in interest rates would result in an incremental positive cash flow of 3.2 million over the next 12 months. 
 See Note 4, Long Term Debt , to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our long-term debt. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We provide services in the highly regulated healthcare industry. In the ordinary course of our business, we are a party to various legal actions, proceedings, and claims as well as regulatory and other governmental audits and investigations. These matters could potentially subject us to sanctions, damages, recoupments, fines, and other penalties. Some of these matters have been material to us in the past, and others in the future may, either individually or in the aggregate, be material and adverse to our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. We do not believe any of our pending legal proceedings are material to us, but there can be no assurance our assessment will not change based on future developments. 
 Additionally, the False Claims Act (the FCA allows private citizens, called relators, to institute civil proceedings on behalf of the United States alleging violations of the FCA. These lawsuits, also known as qui tam actions, are common in the healthcare industry and can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorneys fees and the award of bounties to the relators who successfully prosecute or bring these suits to the government. It is possible that qui tam lawsuits have been filed against us, which suits remain under seal, or that we are unaware of such filings or precluded by existing law or court order from discussing or disclosing the filing of such suits. Therefore, from time to time, we may be party to one or more undisclosed qui tam cases brought pursuant to the FCA.

For purposes of this Section, (i) except as otherwise provided in the applicable Election Agreement, such Stock Election will be effective only for the Covered Year, and a Non-Employee Director who desires to make a Stock Election with respect to a subsequent Year must make such Stock Election for such subsequent Year, and (ii) if a Non-Employee Director fails to make a Stock Election for a Covered Year, then such Non-Employee Director s Cash Compensation for such Covered Year shall be paid entirely in cash. 
 2. Election of Current or Deferred Common Stock . A Participant may receive his or her Common Stock Portion with respect to any Year, elected pursuant to Section 1 of this Article, in the form of shares of Common Stock paid at the time the related Cash Compensation would have otherwise been paid, or may elect to defer receipt of all or a specified portion of such Common Stock Portion in the form of DSUs by making a Deferral Election in the Participant s Election Agreement. Any portion of a Participant s Common Stock Portion that is subject to a Deferral Election will be subject to the provisions of Article IV , and any remaining portion of the Common Stock Portion will be subject to the provisions of Article III . If permitted by the Committee, an Election Agreement may provide that the Participant s Deferral Election applicable to a Year shall continue to be effective for his or her Common Stock Portion for each Year thereafter until terminated or modified by filing a new Deferral Election. 
 3. Procedure for Elections . Any Stock Election made pursuant to Section 1 of this Article (including any Deferral Election made pursuant to Section 2 of this Article) shall be (x) made on an Election Agreement filed with the Chief Human Resources Officer of the Company (or other Company administrative representative as may be designated by the Committee) and (y) made by, and shall be effective as of, the applicable Election Filing Date provided , however , that an individual who first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan during the course of a Year, rather than as of the applicable Election Filing Date, shall make such Stock Election (and, if applicable, Deferral Election) within thirty days following the date the Non-Employee Director first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan (the Newly Eligible Window ). Any Stock Election (and, if applicable, Deferral Election) made during a Newly Eligible Window shall be effective on the first day of the first complete calendar quarter commencing after the date of such Stock Election (and, if applicable, Deferral Election) with regard to Cash Compensation earned during such Year following the filing of the Election Agreement with the Company. For purposes of the preceding sentence, where an individual has ceased being eligible to participate in the Plan (other than the accrual of earnings), regardless of whether all amounts deferred under the Plan have been paid, and subsequently becomes eligible to participate in the Plan again, the individual shall be treated as being initially eligible to participate in the Plan if the individual had not been eligible to participate in the Plan (other than the accrual of earnings) at any time during the twenty-four month period ending on the date the individual again becomes eligible to participate in the Plan.

 ARTICLE III 
 CURRENT COMMON STOCK IN LIEU OF CASH COMPENSATION 
 Amounts subject to a Participant s Current Common Stock Portion will be paid in the form of Common Stock at the time the related Cash Compensation would have otherwise been paid, and the number of shares of Common Stock so paid will be equal to (i) the Current Common Stock Portion Percentage, multiplied by (ii) the quotient (rounded to the nearest whole share) of (x) the dollar value of the Cash Compensation that would have otherwise been paid on such date, divided by (y) the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on such date. 
 ARTICLE IV 
 DEFERRED STOCK UNITS IN LIEU OF CASH COMPENSATION 
 1. DSU Accounts . For each Participant who makes a Deferral Election, there shall be established on the books and records of the Company, for bookkeeping purposes only, a separate Account to reflect the Participant s interest under the Plan.

The Account so established shall be maintained in accordance with the following in respect of each Deferral Election made pursuant to Section 2 of Article II 
 (i) On each day that, absent such Deferral Election, Cash Compensation would be paid to the Participant for service as a Non-Employee Director, the Participant s Account and appropriate Sub-Account shall be credited with DSUs, the number of which shall be determined by multiplying (x) the Deferred Common Stock Portion Percentage by (y) the quotient (rounded to the nearest whole share) of (A) the dollar value of the Cash Compensation that would have otherwise been paid on such date, divided by (B) the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on such date. 
 (ii) As of each date on which the Company pays a cash dividend on its Common Stock, each Participant s Account and appropriate Sub-Account shall be credited with additional DSUs (rounded to the nearest whole share), the number of which shall be determined by (A) multiplying the number of DSUs in the Participant s Account and appropriate Sub-Account on the record date for such dividend by the per-share amount of the dividend so paid, and (B) dividing the amount determined pursuant to clause (A) by the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the dividend payment date. 
 (iii) A Participant s interest in his or her Account and Sub-Accounts shall be fully vested and nonforfeitable at all times. 
 2. Payment Elections . A Participant who makes a Deferral Election pursuant to Section 2 of Article II must also make a Payment Election with respect to the Deferred Common Stock Portion. Subject to Sections 4 and 5 of this Article, all Payment Elections are irrevocable, shall be made on an Election Agreement filed with the Chief Human Resources Officer of the Company (or other Company administrative representative as may be designated by the Committee), and shall comply with the following requirements 
 (i) Each Payment Election shall contain the Participant s election regarding the time at which the payment of DSUs credited to the specific Sub-Account shall be made. 
 1. A Participant may elect to receive payment (in whole shares of Common Stock) upon either (A) the date the Participant incurs a Termination of Service for any reason or (B) the earlier of the date otherwise specified by the Participant in the Election Agreement in accordance with election procedures established by the Committee in compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the date the Participant incurs a Termination of Service for any reason. 

2. Subject to Section 2(iii) of this Article, payments made in accordance with the Participant s election under Section 2(i)(1) of this Article shall be paid (in whole shares of Common Stock) within 90 days following the date triggering payment pursuant to the election under Section 2(i)(1) , provided that, in either case, the Participant shall not have the right to designate the Year of payment. 
 (ii) If the Payment Elections are not made by the applicable Election Filing Date or the date provided for under Section 3 of Article II , if applicable, with respect to a Sub-Account, or are insufficient to be deemed effective as of such date, then the Participant shall be deemed to have elected to receive payment upon Termination of Service. 
 (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 2 of this Article, if the Participant is a Specified Employee at the time of his or her Termination of Service, then any payment on account of Termination of Service that was scheduled to be made during the six-month period immediately following the Participant s Termination of Service shall be made on the first day of the seventh month after such Termination of Service (or, if earlier, the date of death). Any payments on account of Termination of Service that are scheduled to be paid more than six months after such Participant s Termination of Service shall not be delayed and shall be paid in accordance with provisions of Section 3 of this Article. 
 3. Method of Payment . A Participant s Account and Sub-Accounts under the Plan shall be paid at the time(s) provided for under this Article in a lump sum consisting of a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the total number of whole DSUs in the Account and Sub-Accounts that are payable at such time. Any DSUs settled in shares of Common Stock will be delivered under the Omnibus Plan or any other applicable stockholder-approved equity plan of the Company. There shall be deducted from the amount of any payment otherwise required to be made under the Plan all federal, state and local taxes required by law to be withheld by the Company, if any, with respect to such payment. 
 4. Death of a Participant . In the event of the death of a Participant, the amount of the Participant s Account and Sub-Accounts shall be paid (in whole shares of Common Stock) to the Beneficiary or Beneficiaries designated in a writing on a form that the Company may designate from time to time (the Beneficiary Designation within 90 days of the day of death provided , that the Beneficiary or Beneficiaries shall not have the right to designate the Year of payment. A Participant s Beneficiary Designation may be changed at any time prior to his or her death by the execution and delivery of a new Beneficiary Designation. The Beneficiary Designation on file with the Company that bears the latest date at the time of the Participant s death shall govern. In the absence of a Beneficiary Designation or the failure of any Beneficiary to survive the Participant, the amount of the Participant s Account and Sub-Accounts shall be paid (in whole shares of Common Stock) to the Participant s estate within 90 days of the day of death provided that the representative of the estate shall not have the right to designate the Year of payment. 
 5. Change in Control Unforeseeable Emergency . Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 
 (iv) If a Change in Control occurs, the total amount of each Participant s Account and Sub-Accounts shall immediately be paid to the Participant in the form of a single, lump sum payment of whole shares of Common Stock provided that if such Change in Control does not constitute a change in the ownership or effective control or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5), or any successor provision, then payment shall be made, to the extent necessary to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, to the Participant on the date (or dates) the Participant would otherwise be entitled to a distribution (or distributions) in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. 
 (v) In the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency and at the request of a Participant or Beneficiary, the Committee may in its sole discretion accelerate the payment (of whole shares of Common Stock) to the Participant or Beneficiary of all or a part of his or her Account or Sub-Accounts. Payments of amounts as a result of an Unforeseeable Emergency may not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy such Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution(s), after taking into account the extent to which the hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise by liquidation of the Participant s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). 

6. Adjustments . The Committee shall make or provide for such adjustments in the numbers of shares of Common Stock credited to Participants Accounts and Sub-Accounts, and in the kind of such shares, as the Committee in its sole discretion, exercised in good faith, may determine is equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants that otherwise would result from (i) any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the Company, or (ii) any merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other distribution of assets, issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (iii) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of the foregoing. Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for any or all shares of Common Stock deliverable under the Plan such alternative consideration as it, in good faith, may determine to be equitable in the circumstances. 
 7. Fractional Shares . The Company shall not be required to issue any fractional shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan. 
 ARTICLE V 
 ADMINISTRATION 
 1. The Company, through the Committee, shall be responsible for the general administration of the Plan and for carrying out the provisions hereof. The Committee shall have all such powers as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the Plan, including the power to (i) determine all questions relating to eligibility for participation in the Plan and the amount in the Account or Sub-Accounts of any Participant and all questions pertaining to claims for benefits and procedures for claim review, (ii) resolve all other questions arising under the Plan, including any questions of construction, and (iii) take such further action as the Committee shall deem advisable in the administration of the Plan. The actions taken and the decisions made by the Committee hereunder shall be final and binding upon all interested parties. 
 2. No member of the Committee shall be liable for any action, omission, or determination relating to the Plan, and the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Committee and each other director or employee of the Company to whom any duty or power relating to the administration or interpretation of the Plan has been delegated, against any cost or expense (including counsel fees) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the approval of the Committee) arising out of any action, omission, or determination relating to the Plan, unless, in either case, such action, omission, or determination was taken or made by such member, director, or employee in bad faith and without reasonable belief that it was in the best interests of the Company. 
 ARTICLE VI 
 AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION 
 The Company reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time by action of the Board provided , however , that no such action shall adversely affect any Participant or Beneficiary who has an Account, or result in the acceleration of payment of the amount of any Account (except as otherwise permitted under the Plan), without the consent of the Participant or Beneficiary provided , further , that the consent requirement of Participants or Beneficiaries to certain actions shall not apply to any amendment or termination made by the Company pursuant to Section 8(iii) of Article VII . Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may terminate the Plan to the extent and in circumstances described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix), or any successor provision. 
 ARTICLE VII 
 MISCELLANEOUS 
 1. Limitation on Stock Elections . Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, in no event will a Non-Employee Director s Stock Election for a Year result in such Non-Employee Director receiving equity awards under the Omnibus Plan in such Year that exceed any applicable limit on non-employee director equity awards set forth in the Omnibus Plan. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Committee may approve a limit on the aggregate amount of a Non-Employee Director s Cash Compensation that may be subject to a Stock Election for any applicable Year, which limit shall be set forth in the applicable Election Agreement. To the extent that delivery of Common Stock or DSUs pursuant to a Non-Employee Director s Stock Election on any applicable date would cause any applicable limit on non-employee director equity awards under the Omnibus Plan to be exceeded, such excess portion will instead be 

deferred in the form of cash, and the terms of any Deferral Election with respect to such amount will otherwise apply with respect to the cash amount. In the event of such a cash deferral, the Committee may determine the method of payment and a deemed investment medium or interest rate with respect to such cash amount in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. 
 2. Non-alienation of Deferred Compensation . No right or interest under the Plan of any Participant or Beneficiary may be transferred or otherwise disposed of by a Participant or Beneficiary, including by way of sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or otherwise, except as permitted by the Plan or by the Committee, or by will or the laws of descent and distribution. No purported sale, assignment, mortgage, hypothecation, transfer, pledge, encumbrance, gift, transfer in trust (voting or other) or other disposition of, or creation of a security interest in or lien on, any such right or interest by any holder thereof in violation of the provisions of the Plan shall be valid. 
 3. Interest of Director . The obligation of the Company under the Plan to make payment of amounts reflected in an Account merely constitutes the unsecured promise of the Company to make payments from its general assets, as provided herein, and no Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in, or a lien or prior claim upon, any property of the Company. It is the intention of the Company that the Plan be unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. The Company may create a trust to hold funds to be used in payment of its obligations under the Plan, and may fund such trust provided , however , that any funds contained therein shall remain liable for the claims of the Company s general creditors and provided , further , that no amount shall be transferred to trust if, pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, such amount would, for purposes of Section 83 of the Code, be treated as property transferred in connection with the performance of services. 
 4. Claims of Other Persons . The provisions of the Plan shall in no event be construed as giving any other person, firm or corporation any legal or equitable right as against the Company or any subsidiary or the officers, employees or Non-Employee Directors of the Company, except any such rights as are specifically provided for in the Plan or are hereafter created in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Plan. 
 5. Severability . The invalidity and unenforceability of any particular provision of the Plan shall not affect any other provision hereof, and the Plan shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or unenforceable provision were omitted herefrom. 
 6. Governing Law . Except to the extent preempted by federal law, the provisions of the Plan shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. 
 7. Relationship to Other Plans . The Plan is intended to serve the purposes of and to be consistent with the Omnibus Plan and any similar plan approved by the Committee for purposes of the Plan. The issuance or transfer of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan shall be subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the Omnibus Plan and any other such plan. 
 8. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code . 
 (i) To the extent applicable, it is intended that the Plan (including all amendments thereto) comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, so that the income inclusion provisions of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code do not apply to the Participant or a Beneficiary. The Plan shall be administered in a manner consistent with this intent. 
 (ii) Neither a Participant nor any of a Participant s creditors or beneficiaries shall have the right to subject any deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) payable under the Plan to any anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment or garnishment. Except as permitted under Section 409A of the Code, any deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) payable to a Participant or for a Participant s benefit under the Plan may not be reduced by, or offset against, any amount owing by a Participant to the Company or any of its affiliates. 
 (iii) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in light of the uncertainty with respect to the proper application of Section 409A of the Code, the Company reserves the right to make amendments to the Plan as the Company deems necessary or desirable to avoid the imposition of taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code. In any case, a Participant shall be solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may be imposed on a Participant or for a Participant s Account and Sub-Accounts in connection with the Plan (including any taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Code), and neither the 

Company nor any of its affiliates shall have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold a Participant harmless from any or all of such taxes or penalties. 
 9. Headings Interpretation . 
 (i) Headings in the Plan are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in the construction of the provisions hereof. 
 (ii) Any reference in the Plan to Section 409A of the Code will also include any applicable proposed, temporary, or final regulations or any other applicable formal guidance promulgated with respect to such Section 409A of the Code by the U.S. Department of Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service. Further, any specific reference to a Code section or a Treasury Regulation section shall include any successor provision of the Code or the Treasury Regulation, as applicable. 
 (iii) For purposes of the Plan, the phrase permitted by Section 409A of the Code, or words or phrases of similar import, shall mean that the event or circumstance that may occur or exist only if permitted by Section 409A of the Code would not cause an amount deferred or payable under the Plan to be includible in the gross income of a Participant or Beneficiary under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.
