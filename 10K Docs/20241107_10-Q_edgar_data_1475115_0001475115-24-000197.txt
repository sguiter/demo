 Tax Matters 
 The Company is currently under audit in certain jurisdictions with regard to indirect tax matters. The Company establishes reserves for indirect tax matters when it determines that the likelihood of a loss is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Accordingly, the Company has established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to sales and other indirect taxes in the amount of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These amounts, which represent management s best estimates of its potential liability, include potential interest and penalties of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Company does not believe that any ultimate liability resulting from any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, the outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against the Company for amounts in excess of management s expectations, the Company s financial statements, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.

Creators use our highly-scalable self-service ticketing and marketing tools to plan, promote and sell tickets to their events and event seekers use our website and mobile application to discover and purchase tickets to experiences they love. 
 
 Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We monitor key metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. In addition to revenue, net loss and other results under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the following tables set forth key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures we use to evaluate our business. We believe these metrics and measures are useful to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to our investors as this metric is used by management in assessing the health of our business and our operating performance, making operating decisions, evaluating performance and performing strategic planning and annual budgeting. This measure is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. You are encouraged to evaluate the adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate. 
 Paid Ticket Volume 
 Paid ticket volume is measured by the number of tickets sold on our platform that generate ticket fees, referred to as paid ticket volume. We consider paid ticket volume an important indicator of the underlying health of the business. The table below sets forth the paid ticket volume for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) Paid ticket volume 19,736 22,855 62,195 69,342 
 Our paid ticket volume for events in the United States and outside of the United States was 59 and 41 in the three months and 60 and 40 , respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 60 and 40 in the three months and 61 and 39 , respectively, in nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure for business planning purposes and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, interest income, interest expense, employer taxes related to employee equity transactions, other (income) expense, net, and income tax provision. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

 The following table presents our Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated and a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP measure, net loss, for each of the periods indicated:

 (1) Restructuring related costs are included in Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA. 
 Some of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA include (i) Adjusted EBITDA does not properly reflect capital spending that occurs off of the income statement or account for future contractual commitments, (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures and (iii) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest and principal required to service our indebtedness. Our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner as we calculate the measure, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items. When evaluating our performance, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including our net loss and other GAAP results.

 Net Revenue 
 We currently generate revenues primarily from service fees and payment processing fees from the sale of paid tickets on our platform. Our ticketing fee structure typically consists of a flat per ticket fee and a percentage of the price of each ticket sold by a creator. Revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the creator, which is when the ticket is sold for service fees and payment processing fees. We also derive a portion of revenues from fees associated with advertising and other marketplace services. Net revenue excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes (VAT) and is presented net of estimated customer refunds, chargebacks and amortization of creator signing fees.

 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands except percentages) Total net revenue 77,801 81,544 (3,743) (5) 248,604 238,370 10,234 4 
 
 Net revenue decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in ticketing revenue due to a lower paid ticket volume. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 also reflects changes to organizer fees, including the discontinuation of the Flex plan and a reduction to Pro plan pricing. 
 Net revenue increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in marketplace revenue, which consisted of organizer fees launched in June 2023 and advertising services. This increase was offset by a decrease in ticketing revenue due to a lower paid ticket volume. 
 Cost of Net Revenue 
 Cost of net revenue consists of variable costs related to payment processing fees and fixed costs related to making our platform generally available. Our fixed costs consist primarily of expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of our platform, including website hosting fees and platform infrastructure costs, amortization of capitalized software development costs, on-site operations costs and customer support costs. Cost of net revenue also includes the amortization expense related to our acquired developed technology assets, which may be incurred in future periods related to future acquisitions. 
 Generally, we expect cost of net revenue to fluctuate as a percentage of net revenue in the near- to mid-term primarily driven by the fixed costs absorption relative to total net revenue and our geographical revenue mix. Our payment processing costs for credit and debit card payments are generally lower outside of the United States due to a number of factors, including lower card network fees and lower cost alternative payment networks. Consequently, if we generate more revenue internationally, we expect that our overall payment processing costs will decline as a percentage of total revenue. As our total net revenue increases or decreases and our fixed costs are unaffected, our cost of net revenue as a percentage of net revenue will similarly fluctuate. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands except percentages) Cost of net revenue 24,543 25,867 (1,324) (5) 74,186 76,865 (2,679) (3) Percentage of total net revenue 32 32 30 32 Gross margin 68 68 70 68 
 Cost of net revenue decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to reduced processing fees and lower personnel costs due to the 2023 restructuring. 
 Our gross margin remained consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross margin improved during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher margin attributed to marketplace revenue streams.

 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses consist of product development, sales, marketing and support and general and administrative expenses. Direct and indirect personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, are the most significant recurring component of operating expenses. 
 As our total net revenue increases or decreases, to the extent our operating expenses are not equally affected, our operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue will similarly fluctuate. 
 Product development 
 Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation, and third-party infrastructure expenses incurred in developing our platform including software subscription costs. Generally, we expect our product development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we focus on enhancing and expanding the capabilities of our platform. Our product development expenses remained generally consistent year-over-year as a percentage of net revenue. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands except percentages) Product development 22,586 23,041 (455) (2) 75,327 73,091 2,236 3 Percentage of total net revenue 29 28 30 31 
 Product development expenses remained generally consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by costs during the period associated with the reduction in force, offset by adjustments to our full-year compensation expense. 
 Product development expenses increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increased employee related costs, including stock-based compensation, due to headcount growth in our product development and engineering organization as we continue to focus our investment in building the functionality, scalability and security of our platform. 
 Sales, marketing and support 
 Sales, marketing and support expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our employees involved in selling and marketing our products and in public relations and communication activities, in addition to marketing programs spend. For our sales teams, this also includes commissions. Sales, marketing and support expenses are driven by investments to grow and retain creators and attendees on our platform, and improve the customer experience. Additionally, we classify certain creator-related expenses, including instances in which we issue refunds to consumers on behalf of creators and reserves for estimated advance payout losses, as sales, marketing and support expenses. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands except percentages) Sales, marketing and support 23,694 21,063 2,631 12 69,084 53,802 15,282 28 Percentage of total net revenue 30 26 28 23 
 Sales, marketing and support expenses remained generally consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase to the chargeback reserve and refunds to consumers issued by the company due to greater chargeback and fraud activity, offset by a decrease in advertising spend and adjustments to our full-year compensation expense. 
 Sales, marketing and support expenses increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by changes in reserves, including a 8.6 million increase due to greater chargeback and fraud activity and a 4.7 million change to our advanced payouts reserve compared to the prior year. The increase also included an increase in employee related costs, including stock-based compensation, offset by a decrease in advertising spend and restructuring costs.

 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, and professional fees for finance, accounting, legal, risk, human resources and other corporate functions. Our general and administrative expenses also include accruals for sales and business taxes, as well as reserves and impairment charges related to creator upfront payments. Over the long-term, we anticipate general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of net revenue as we expect to grow our net revenues and scale our business. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands except percentages) General and administrative 15,930 23,137 (7,207) (31) 52,983 66,681 (13,698) (21) Percentage of total net revenue 20 28 21 28 
 General and administrative expenses decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreased personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, as a result of adjustments to our full-year compensation expense during the period and our workforce reductions in the third quarter of 2024 and first quarter of 2023. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and amounts held on behalf of customers. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands except percentages) Interest income 6,056 7,569 (1,513) (20) 20,845 19,948 897 4 Percentage of total net revenue 8 9 8 8 
 Interest income decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a lower balance of short-term investments in U.S. Treasury bills. 
 Interest income increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher interest rates in the current year. 
 Interest Expense 
 In March 2021, we issued 212.75 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes and in June 2020, we issued 150.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes. 
 Interest expense consists primarily of cash interest expense, amortization of debt discount, and issuance costs on our Convertible Notes. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change (in thousands except percentages) Interest expense 2,084 2,821 (737) (26) 7,690 8,359 (669) (8) Percentage of total net revenue 3 3 3 4 
 Interest expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the repurchase of 120 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes during August 2024. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign exchange rate remeasurement gains and losses recorded from consolidating our subsidiaries each period-end.

 Other income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by foreign currency rate measurement fluctuations and a 3.9 million gain awarded from a litigation settlement in June 2024. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 Income tax provision consists primarily of U.S. federal and state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. The differences in the tax provision for the periods presented and the U.S. federal statutory rate is primarily due to foreign taxes in profitable jurisdictions and the recording of a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions including the United States. The computation of the provision for income taxes for interim periods is determined by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date earnings from recurring operations and adjusting for discrete tax items recorded in the period.

 The decrease in provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to insignificant non-routine tax expenses recorded during both years and changes in taxable earnings mix. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 531.0 million, short-term investments of 24.7 million and funds receivable of 30.2 million. Our cash and cash equivalents include bank deposits, U.S. Treasury bills and money market funds held by financial institutions. Our short-term investment portfolio, which consists of U.S. Treasury bills, is designed to preserve principal and provide liquidity. Our funds receivable represents cash-in-transit from credit card processors that is received to our bank accounts within five business days of the underlying ticket transaction. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 25 of our cash was held outside of the United States. We do not expect to incur significant taxes related to these amounts. The cash was held primarily to fund our foreign operations and on behalf of, and to be remitted to, creators. Collectively, our cash and cash equivalents balances represent a mix of cash that belongs to us and cash that is due to creators. 
 The amounts due to creators, which were 355.1 million as of September 30, 2024, are captioned on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable, creators. These ticketing proceeds are legally unrestricted, and we invest a portion of creator cash in U.S. Treasury bills with original maturities less than one year. For qualified creators, we pass ticket sales proceeds to the creator prior to the event, subject to certain limitations. Internally, we refer to these payments as advance payouts. When we provide advance payouts, we assume risk that the event may be canceled, fraudulent or materially not as described, resulting in significant chargebacks and refund requests. The terms of our standard merchant agreement obligate creators to repay us for ticket sales advanced under such circumstances. If the creator is insolvent, has spent the proceeds of the ticket sales for event-related costs, has canceled the event, or has engaged in fraudulent activity, we may not be able to recover our advance payout losses from these events. Such unrecoverable amounts could equal up to the value of the ticket sales or amounts settled to the creator prior to the event that has been postponed or canceled or is otherwise disputed. We record estimates for losses related to chargebacks and refunds based on various factors, including the amounts paid and outstanding to creators in conjunction with the advance payout program, macroeconomic conditions, and actual chargeback and refund activity trends. Due to the nature of macroeconomic events, including but not limited to shifts in consumer behavior, inflation, increased labor costs, and increased interest rates, there is uncertainty around these reserves and our actual losses could be materially different from our current estimates. We will adjust our recorded reserves in the future to reflect our best estimates of future outcomes, and we may pay in cash a portion of, all of, or a greater amount than the 9.1 million provision recorded as of September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 In June 2020, we issued the 2025 Notes, and in March 2021, we issued the 2026 Notes. The 2025 Notes mature on December 1, 2025 and the 2026 Notes mature on September 15, 2026. Under certain circumstances, holders may surrender their notes of a series for conversion prior to the applicable maturity date. Upon conversion, the notes may be settled in cash, shares of Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at our election. During the third quarter of 2024, we entered into separately, privately negotiated Repurchases, pursuant to which we repurchased 120 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes. See Note 16, "Debt", for details regarding the Repurchases. 
 On March 14, 2024, we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to 100.0 million of the Company s Class A common stock, which does not have an expiration date. Through September 30, 2024, we repurchased 7,243,283 shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of 39.4 million. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 60.7 million remained available and authorized for future repurchases. 
 We believe that our existing cash, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. 
 Cash Flows 
 Our cash flow activities were as follows for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 85,628 101,800 Investing activities 124,644 (68,516) Financing activities (166,129) (3,990) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (2,386) (925) Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 41,757 28,369 
 
 Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 The net cash provided by operating activities of 85.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to our net loss of 7.2 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 66.8 million primarily driven by stock-based compensation expense, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities that used 26.0 million in cash, primarily driven by timing of accounts payable to creators and funds receivable. 
 The net cash provided by operating activities of 101.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to our net loss of 25.5 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 62.2 million primarily driven by stock-based compensation expense and changes to our operating assets and liabilities that provided 65.1 million in cash, primarily driven by timing of accounts payable to creators and funds receivable. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities of 124.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of 269.0 million maturity of short-term investments, offset by 136.8 million in purchases of short-term investments. 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 68.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of 273.7 million in purchases of short-term investments, offset by a 211.0 million maturity of short-term investments. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities of 166.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the 120.5 million repurchase of the 2025 Notes, 39.3 million repurchase of our Class A common stock and 6.8 million in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 Net cash used in financing activities of 4.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to 5.5 million in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, offset by 0.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 The effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows relates to certain of our assets, primarily cash balances held on behalf of creators that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. These cash assets held for creators are directly offset by a corresponding liability to creators. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we recorded a 2.4 million and 0.9 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, respectively, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The impact of the effect of exchange rate changes are primarily attributed to creator cash balances, which can serve as a natural hedge for the effect of exchange rates on accounts payable, creators presented within operating activities. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Our principal commitments consist of obligations under the Convertible Notes (including principal and coupon interest) and operating leases for office space, as well as non-cancellable purchase commitments. See Note 17, "Commitments and Contingencies" to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements and did not have any such arrangements as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or assumptions or a revision of the carrying value of assets or liabilities as of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These estimates and assumptions may change in the future, however, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 "Significant Accounting Policies" in the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes to these policies that have had a material impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 We are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to balances of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 531.0 million and short-term investments of 24.7 million, which consisted primarily of money market funds and U.S. Treasury bills. The primary objective of our investment approach is to preserve capital principal and provide liquidity. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the United States. A 10 change in the level of market interest rates would not have a material effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. In addition, our Convertible Notes are subject to fixed annual interest charges. These Convertible Notes therefore are not exposed to financial or economic risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these Convertible Notes may fluctuate when interest rates change or can be affected when the market price of our Class A common stock fluctuates. We carry the Convertible Notes at face value less unamortized issuance cost on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Many creators live or operate outside the United States, and therefore, we have significant ticket sales denominated in foreign currencies, most notably the British Pound, Euro, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we are subject to foreign currency risk, which may adversely impact our financial results. The functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Movements in foreign exchange rates are recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in foreign exchange gains and losses related to changes in exchange rates. If our foreign-currency denominated assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses increase, our results of operations may be more significantly impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies in which we do business. A 10 increase or decrease in individual currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required for disclosure in reports filed or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Company management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 See Note 17, "Commitments and Contingencies" to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, of our 2023 Form 10-K, except for the following risk factors which supplement the risk factors previously disclosed and should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in the 2023 Form 10-K. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described in the 2023 Form 10-K, together with all of the other information in the 2023 Form 10-K and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, and other documents that we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The risks and uncertainties described in the 2023 10-K and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be harmed. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. 
 The pricing and composition of our packages may affect our ability to attract or retain creators. 
 Our event creators can select from different pricing packages based on the features required, service level desired and budget. We assess the pricing and composition of our pricing packages based on prior experience, feedback from creators and data insights, and we periodically adjust the pricing and composition of our packages, and may periodically adjust the structure of our pricing model. 
 In early 2023, we raised ticketing fees for the first time in five years, and we have implemented pricing increases since January 2023 to reflect enhanced product features. We plan to continue making changes to our pricing structure from time to time. 
 In June 2023, we introduced a new pricing model which introduced new plans, fee types and subscription packages for event creators, which may include an organizer fee to creators in order to publish an event on the Eventbrite marketplace. In September 2024, we updated our pricing model to remove upfront fees, enabling creators to publish unlimited events of any size on Eventbrite. Creators who would like a broader set of marketing features are still able to opt into a subscription package to access our all-in-one marketing suite and enhanced customer support. Despite returning to a free to publish model, we may be unable to win back the business of departed creators, attract new creators or retain existing creators if we are unable to regain creators trust and demonstrate the value of our marketplace. 
 Although events of all sizes can now be published for free in our marketplace, our business will still depend, in part, on creators selecting and renewing subscription plans with us. Creators who opt into our subscription programs have no obligation to renew their subscriptions, and it is difficult to accurately predict long-term customer retention. If we are unable to provide subscription-based creators with the services and products they expect, we might be unable to retain or grow our subscriber base and thus adversely affect our subscription-based revenues. Additionally, changes to our pricing model and package composition, or our inability to effectively or competitively price our packages and solutions, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and impact our ability to predict our future performance. 
 Some creators rely on our third-party distribution partners, such as Meta, Bandsintown and TikTok to connect with and attract consumers and we depend on this network of distribution partners to reach consumers. 
 Our platform enables the sale and distribution of event tickets through select third-party platforms, such as Meta, Bandsintown and TikTok. Creators are able to publicize their events and sell tickets through these third-party platforms, and these distribution partnerships enable consumers to discover Eventbrite events on other platforms where they spend time. This dynamic enables creators to reach more consumers and makes our platform more appealing to creators looking to grow their audiences. These third-party distribution partners have in the past, and may in the future, terminate their relationship with us, fail to maintain integrations, limit certain integration functionality, change their treatment of our services, restrict access to their platform by creators or consumers, or change their algorithms or consumer experience at any time, thereby impacting the business performance of Eventbrite and its creators. For example, in late 2023, Meta discontinued its Facebook native ticketing product. This means that consumers are no longer able to buy tickets to Eventbrite events directly on Facebook, rather they can continue buying Eventbrite tickets through a clickout experience. If any such third-party services become incompatible with our 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 platform or the use of our platform and solutions on such third-party platforms are restricted in the future, our business may be harmed. 
 In addition, to the extent that Google, or other leading large technology companies that have a significant presence in our key markets disintermediate ticketing or event management providers, whether by offering their own comprehensive event-focused or shopping capabilities, or by referring leads to suppliers, other favored partners or themselves directly, there could be harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We rely on the experience and expertise of our senior management team, key technical employees and other highly skilled personnel and the failure to retain, motivate or integrate any of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our success depends upon the continued service of our senior management team and key technical employees, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and integrate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Each of our employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The loss of any member of our senior management team or key personnel might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could harm our business and our relationships. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense. 
 To execute on our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We have had difficulty filling certain open positions in the past. We recently implemented a reduction in force that eliminated approximately 11 of our workforce, and this action may hurt our employer brand and make it more difficult to hire employees in the future. We face significant competition for personnel, specifically for engineers experienced in designing and developing cloud-based platform products. 
 Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have, and we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, increasingly competitive compensation and benefits packages. In addition, prospective and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If there is limited upside to the value of our equity awards, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key employees, and some of our existing employees have option awards that are priced at below our current stock price. Further, we may need to increase our employee compensation levels in response to competition, labor market conditions, rising inflation or labor shortages, which would increase our operating expenses and reduce our margins. We may not be able to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs, including as a result of labor market shortages. New hires require training and take time before they achieve full productivity and may not become as productive as we expect. This may be more difficult given our shift to a flexible work from home model. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency and ability to meet forecasts, as well as our employee morale, productivity and retention, could suffer, which may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be utilized to the full value approved or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. 
 Our board of directors has authorized management to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock at management s discretion. Share repurchases may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions or by any combination of such methods. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The manner, timing and amount of any share repurchases may fluctuate and will be determined by us based on a variety of factors, including the market price of our Class A common stock, our priorities for the use of cash to support our business operations and plans, general business and market conditions, tax laws, and alternative investment opportunities, all of which may be further impacted by macroeconomic conditions and factors, including rising interest rates, and inflation, global conflicts, and public health crises. Our share repurchase program authorization does not have an expiration date nor does it obligate us to acquire any specific number or dollar value of shares. Our share repurchase programs may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our Class A common stock. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a 1 excise tax on share repurchases, which increases the costs associated with repurchasing shares of our Class A common stock. Even if our share repurchase program is fully implemented, it may not enhance long-term stockholder value or may not prove to be the best use of our cash. Share repurchases could have an impact on our share trading prices, increase the volatility of the price of our Class A common stock, or reduce our available cash balance such that we will be required to seek financing to support our operations.

Max. of 100,000 per yr. 
 Once exercisable, this Stock Option shall continue to be exercisable at any time or times prior to the close of business on the Expiration Date, subject to the provisions hereof and of the Plan. 
 2. Manner of Exercise . 
 (a) The Optionee may exercise this Stock Option only in the following manner from time to time on or prior to the Expiration Date of this Stock Option, the Optionee may give written notice to the Administrator of his or her election to purchase some or all of the Option Shares purchasable at the time of such notice. This notice shall specify the number of Option Shares to be purchased. 
 Payment of the purchase price for the Option Shares may be made by one or more of the following methods (i) in cash, by certified or bank check or other instrument acceptable to the Administrator (ii) through the delivery (or attestation to the ownership) of shares of Stock that have been purchased by the Optionee on the open market or that are beneficially owned by the Optionee and are not then subject to any restrictions under any Company plan and that otherwise satisfy any holding periods as may be required by the Administrator or (iii) by the Optionee delivering to the Company a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company cash or a check payable and acceptable to the Company to pay the option purchase price, provided that in the event the Optionee chooses to pay the option purchase price as so provided, the Optionee and the broker shall comply with such procedures and enter into such agreements of indemnity and other agreements as the Administrator shall prescribe as a condition of such payment procedure or (iv) a combination of (i), (ii) and (iii) above. Payment instruments will be received subject to collection. 
 The transfer to the Optionee on the records of the Company or of the transfer agent of the Option Shares will be contingent upon (i) the Company s receipt from the Optionee of the full purchase price for the Option Shares, as set forth above, (ii) the fulfillment of any other requirements contained herein or in the Plan or in any other agreement or provision of laws, and (iii) the receipt by the Company of any agreement, statement or other evidence that the Company may require to satisfy itself that the issuance of Stock to be purchased pursuant to the exercise of Stock Options under the Plan and any subsequent resale of the shares of Stock will be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In the event the Optionee chooses to pay the purchase price by previously-owned shares of Stock through the attestation method, the number of shares of Stock transferred to the Optionee upon the exercise of the Stock Option shall be net of the Shares attested to. 
 (b) The shares of Stock purchased upon exercise of this Stock Option shall be transferred to the Optionee on the records of the Company or of the transfer agent upon compliance to the satisfaction of the Administrator with all requirements under applicable laws or regulations in connection with such transfer and with the requirements hereof and of the Plan. The determination of the Administrator as to such compliance shall be final and binding on the 
 3 

Optionee. The Optionee shall not be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares of Stock subject to this Stock Option unless and until this Stock Option shall have been exercised pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company or the transfer agent shall have transferred the shares to the Optionee, and the Optionee s name shall have been entered as the stockholder of record on the books of the Company. Thereupon, the Optionee shall have full voting, dividend and other ownership rights with respect to such shares of Stock. 
 (c) The minimum number of shares with respect to which this Stock Option may be exercised at any one time shall be 100 shares, unless the number of shares with respect to which this Stock Option is being exercised is the total number of shares subject to exercise under this Stock Option at the time. 
 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof or of the Plan, no portion of this Stock Option shall be exercisable after the Expiration Date hereof. 
 3. Termination of Employment . If the Optionee s employment by the Company or a Subsidiary (as defined in the Plan) is terminated, the period within which to exercise the Stock Option may be subject to earlier termination as set forth below. 
 (a) Termination Due to Death . If the Optionee s employment terminates by reason of the Optionee s death, any portion of this Stock Option outstanding on such date, to the extent exercisable on the date of death, may thereafter be exercised by the Optionee s legal representative or legatee for a period of 12 months from the date of death or until the Expiration Date, if earlier. Any portion of this Stock Option that is not exercisable on the date of death shall terminate immediately and be of no further force or effect. 
 (b) Termination Due to Disability . If the Optionee s employment terminates by reason of the Optionee s disability (as determined by the Administrator), any portion of this Stock Option outstanding on such date, to the extent exercisable on the date of such termination of employment, may thereafter be exercised by the Optionee for a period of 12 months from the date of disability or until the Expiration Date, if earlier. Any portion of this Stock Option that is not exercisable on the date of disability shall terminate immediately and be of no further force or effect. 
 (c) Termination for Cause . If the Optionee s employment terminates for Cause, any portion of this Stock Option outstanding on such date shall terminate immediately and be of no further force and effect. For purposes hereof, Cause shall mean, unless otherwise provided in an employment agreement between the Company and the Optionee, a determination by the Administrator that the Optionee shall be dismissed as a result of (i) any material breach by the Optionee of any agreement between the Optionee and the Company (ii) the conviction of, indictment for or plea of nolo contendere by the Optionee to a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude or (iii) any material misconduct or willful and deliberate non-performance (other than by reason of disability) by the Optionee of the Optionee s duties to the Company. 
 (d) Other Termination . If the Optionee s employment terminates for any reason other than the Optionee s death, the Optionee s disability, or Cause, and unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, any portion of this Stock Option outstanding on such date may be exercised, to the extent exercisable on the date of termination, for a period of three months 
 4 

from the date of termination or until the Expiration Date, if earlier. Any portion of this Stock Option that is not exercisable on the date of termination shall terminate immediately and be of no further force or effect. 
 The Administrator s determination of the reason for termination of the Optionee s employment shall be conclusive and binding on the Optionee and his or her representatives or legatees.

 2. Manner of Exercise . 
 (a) The Optionee may exercise this Stock Option only in the following manner from time to time on or prior to the Expiration Date of this Stock Option, the Optionee may give written notice to the Administrator of his or her election to purchase some or all of the Option Shares purchasable at the time of such notice. This notice shall specify the number of Option Shares to be purchased. 
 Payment of the purchase price for the Option Shares may be made by one or more of the following methods (i) in cash, by certified or bank check or other instrument acceptable to the Administrator (ii) through the delivery (or attestation to the ownership) of shares of Stock that have been purchased by the Optionee on the open market or that are beneficially owned by the Optionee and are not then subject to any restrictions under any Company plan and that otherwise satisfy any holding periods as may be required by the Administrator (iii) by the Optionee delivering to the Company a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company cash or a check payable and acceptable to the Company to pay the option purchase price, provided that in the event the Optionee chooses to pay the option purchase price as so provided, the Optionee and the broker shall comply with such procedures and enter into such agreements of indemnity and other agreements as the Administrator shall prescribe as a condition of such payment procedure (iv) by a net exercise arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the number of shares of Stock issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate exercise price or (v) a combination of (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above. Payment instruments will be received subject to collection. 
 The transfer to the Optionee on the records of the Company or of the transfer agent of the Option Shares will be contingent upon (i) the Company s receipt from the Optionee of the full purchase price for the Option Shares, as set forth above, (ii) the fulfillment of any other requirements contained herein or in the Plan or in any other agreement or provision of laws, and (iii) the receipt by the Company of any agreement, statement or other evidence that the Company may require to satisfy itself that the issuance of Stock to be purchased pursuant to the exercise of Stock Options under the Plan and any subsequent resale of the shares of Stock will be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In the event the Optionee chooses to pay the purchase price by previously-owned shares of Stock through the attestation method, the number of shares of Stock transferred to the Optionee upon the exercise of the Stock Option shall be net of the Shares attested to. 
 (b) The shares of Stock purchased upon exercise of this Stock Option shall be transferred to the Optionee on the records of the Company or of the transfer agent upon 
 3 

compliance to the satisfaction of the Administrator with all requirements under applicable laws or regulations in connection with such transfer and with the requirements hereof and of the Plan. The determination of the Administrator as to such compliance shall be final and binding on the Optionee.

Thereupon, the Optionee shall have full voting, dividend and other ownership rights with respect to such shares of Stock. 
 (c) The minimum number of shares with respect to which this Stock Option may be exercised at any one time shall be 100 shares, unless the number of shares with respect to which this Stock Option is being exercised is the total number of shares subject to exercise under this Stock Option at the time. 
 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof or of the Plan, no portion of this Stock Option shall be exercisable after the Expiration Date hereof. 
 3. Termination of Employment . If the Optionee s employment by the Company or a Subsidiary (as defined in the Plan) is terminated, the period within which to exercise the Stock Option may be subject to earlier termination as set forth below.

Any portion of this Stock Option that is not exercisable on the date of death shall terminate immediately and be of no further force or effect. 
 (b) Termination Due to Disability . If the Optionee s employment terminates by reason of the Optionee s disability (as determined by the Administrator), any portion of this Stock Option outstanding on such date, to the extent exercisable on the date of such termination of employment, may thereafter be exercised by the Optionee for a period of 12 months from the date of disability or until the Expiration Date, if earlier. Any portion of this Stock Option that is not exercisable on the date of disability shall terminate immediately and be of no further force or effect. 
 (c) Termination for Cause . If the Optionee s employment terminates for Cause, any portion of this Stock Option outstanding on such date shall terminate immediately and be of no further force and effect. For purposes hereof, Cause shall mean, unless otherwise provided in an employment agreement between the Company and the Optionee, a determination by the Administrator that the Optionee shall be dismissed as a result of (i) any material breach by the Optionee of any agreement between the Optionee and the Company (ii) the conviction of, indictment for or plea of nolo contendere by the Optionee to a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude or (iii) any material misconduct or willful and deliberate non-performance (other than by reason of disability) by the Optionee of the Optionee s duties to the Company. 
 4

If the Optionee s employment terminates for any reason other than the Optionee s death, the Optionee s disability or Cause, and unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, any portion of this Stock Option outstanding on such date may be exercised, to the extent exercisable on the date of termination, for a period of three months from the date of termination or until the Expiration Date, if earlier. Any portion of this Stock Option that is not exercisable on the date of termination shall terminate immediately and be of no further force or effect.

In this regard, the Grantee authorizes the Company and or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following (i) withholding from the Grantee s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Grantee by the Company and or the Employer (ii) withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Stock acquired upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Grantee s behalf pursuant to this authorization) (iii) withholding from shares of Stock to be issued to the Grantee upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, provided, however, that if the Grantee is a Section 16 officer of the Company under the Exchange Act, then the Company will withhold in shares of Stock upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, in which case, the obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (i) and (ii) above or (iv) any other method of withholding determined by the Company and permitted by applicable law. 
 (c) Depending on the withholding method, the Company and or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in the Grantee s jurisdiction(s), in which case the Grantee may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the equivalent amount in shares of Stock. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares of Stock, for tax purposes, the Grantee is deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Stock subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Stock are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. 
 (d) The Grantee agrees to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Grantee s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares of Stock, or the proceeds of the sale of shares of Stock, if the Grantee fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

Neither the Plan nor this Agreement shall interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the employment of the Grantee at any time. 
 9. Integration . This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to this Award and supersedes all prior agreements and discussions between the parties concerning such subject matter. 
 10. Data Privacy Consent . By accepting the Restricted Stock Units via the Company s acceptance procedure, the Grantee is declaring that he or she agrees with the data processing practices described herein and consents to the collection, processing and use of Personal Data (as defined below) by the Company and the transfer of Personal Data to the recipients mentioned herein, including recipients located in countries which do not adduce an adequate level of protection from a European (or other non-U.S.) data protection law perspective, for the purposes described herein. 
 (a) Declaration of Consent . The Grantee understands that he or she needs to review the following information about the processing of the Grantee s personal data by or on behalf of the Company, the Employer and or any Subsidiary as described in the Agreement and any other Restricted Stock Unit grant materials (the Personal Data and declare his or her consent.

 (b) Data Processing and Legal Basis . The Company collects, uses and otherwise processes Personal Data about the Grantee for the purposes of allocating shares of Stock and implementing, administering and managing the Plan. The Grantee understands that this Personal Data may include, without limitation, the Grantee s name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance number, passport number or other identification number (e.g., resident registration number), salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company or its Subsidiaries, details of all Restricted Stock Units or any other entitlement to shares of stock or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Grantee s favor. The legal basis for the processing of the Grantee s Personal Data will be the Grantee s consent. 
 (c) Stock Plan Administration Service Providers . The Grantee understands that the Company transfers the Grantee s Personal Data, or parts thereof, to E TRADE (and its affiliated companies), an independent service provider based in the United States which assists the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. 
 5 

In the future, the Company may select a different service provider and share the Grantee s Personal Data with such different service provider that serves the Company in a similar manner. The Grantee understands and acknowledges that the Company s service provider will open an account for the Grantee to receive and trade shares of Stock acquired under the Plan and that the Grantee will be asked to agree on separate terms and data processing practices with the service provider, which is a condition of the Grantee s ability to participate in the Plan. 
 (d) International Data Transfers. The Grantee understands that the Company and, as of the date hereof, any third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, such as the Company s service providers, are based in the United States. If the Grantee is located outside the United States, the Grantee understands and acknowledges that the Grantee s country has enacted data privacy laws that are different from the laws of the United States. For example, the European Commission has issued only a limited adequacy finding with respect to the United States that applies solely if and to the extent that companies self-certify and remain self-certified under the EU U.S. Privacy Shield program. Otherwise, transfers of personal data from the EU to the United States can be made on the basis of Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or other appropriate safeguards permissible under applicable law. If the Grantee is located in the EU or EEA, the Company may receive, process and transfer the Grantee s Personal Data onward to third-party service providers solely on the basis of appropriate data transfer agreements or other appropriate safeguards permissible under applicable law. If applicable, the Grantee understands that the Grantee can ask for a copy of the appropriate data processing agreements underlying the transfer of the Grantee s Personal Data by contacting the Grantee s local human resources representative. The Company s legal basis for the transfer of the Grantee s Personal Data is the Grantee s consent. 
 (e) Data Retention. The Grantee understands that the Company will use the Grantee s Personal Data only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Grantee s participation in the Plan, or to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including under tax and securities laws. In the latter case, the Grantee understands and acknowledges that the Company s legal basis for the processing of the Grantee s Personal Data would be compliance with the relevant laws or regulations or the pursuit by the Company of respective legitimate interests not outweighed by the Grantee s interests, rights or freedoms. When the Company no longer needs the Grantee s Personal Data for any of the above purposes, the Grantee understands the Company will remove it from its systems. 
 (f) Voluntariness and Consequences of Denial Withdrawal of Consent . The Grantee understands that the Grantee s participation in the Plan and the Grantee s consent is purely voluntary. The Grantee may deny or later withdraw the Grantee s consent at any time, with future effect and for any or no reason. If the Grantee denies or later withdraws the Grantee s consent, the Company can no longer offer the Grantee participation in the Plan or offer other awards to the Grantee or administer or maintain such awards and the Grantee would no longer be able to participate in the Plan. The Grantee further understands that denial or withdrawal of the Grantee s consent would not affect the Grantee s status or salary as an employee or the Grantee s career and that the Grantee would merely forfeit the opportunities associated with the Plan. 
 6 

(g) Data Subject Rights. The Grantee understands that data subject rights regarding the processing of personal data vary depending on the applicable law and that, depending on where the Grantee is based and subject to the conditions set out in the applicable law, the Grantee may have, without limitation, the rights to (i) inquire whether and what kind of Personal Data the Company holds about the Grantee and how it is processed, and to access or request copies of such Personal Data, (ii) request the correction or supplementation of Personal Data about the Grantee that is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date in light of the purposes underlying the processing, (iii) obtain the erasure of Personal Data no longer necessary for the purposes underlying the processing, processed based on withdrawn consent, processed for legitimate interests that, in the context of the Grantee s objection, do not prove to be compelling, or processed in non-compliance with applicable legal requirements, (iv) request the Company to restrict the processing of the Grantee s Personal Data in certain situations where the Grantee feels its processing is inappropriate, (v) object, in certain circumstances, to the processing of Personal Data for legitimate interests, and to (vi) request portability of the Grantee s Personal Data that the Grantee has actively or passively provided to the Company (which does not include data derived or inferred from the collected data), where the processing of such Personal Data is based on consent or the Grantee s employment and is carried out by automated means. In case of concerns, the Grantee understands that the Grantee may also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent local data protection authority. Further, to receive clarification of, or to exercise any of, the Grantee s rights the Grantee understands that the Grantee should contact the Grantee s local human resources representative. 
 (h) Alternate Basis and Additional Consents. Finally, the Grantee understands that the Company may rely on a different basis for the processing or transfer of Personal Data in the future and or request that the Grantee provide another data privacy consent. If applicable, the Grantee agrees that upon request of the Company or the Employer, the Grantee will provide an executed acknowledgement or data privacy consent form (or any other agreements or consents) that the Company and or the Employer may deem necessary to obtain from the Grantee for the purpose of administering the Grantee s participation in the Plan in compliance with the data privacy laws in the Grantee s country, either now or in the future.

 (j) unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Restricted Stock Units and the benefits evidenced by the Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Restricted Stock Units or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the shares of Stock of the Company and

 WARNING This is an offer of rights to receive shares of Stock underlying the Restricted Stock Units. The shares of Stock, if issued, give the Grantee a stake in the ownership of the Company. The Grantee may receive a return if dividends are paid on the shares of Stock. 
 
 If the Company runs into financial difficulties and is wound up, the Grantee will be paid only after all creditors and holders of preferred shares have been paid. The Grantee may lose some or all of his or her investment. 
 
 New Zealand law normally requires people who offer financial products to give information to investors before they invest. This information is designed to help investors to make an informed decision. The usual rules do not apply to this offer because it is made under an employee share scheme. As a result, the Grantee may not be given all the information usually required. The Grantee will also have fewer other legal protections for this investment. 
 
 The Grantee should ask questions, read all documents carefully, and seek independent financial advice before committing himself or herself. 
 
 The shares of Stock are quoted or approved for trading on the NYSE . This means that, if the Grantee vests in Restricted Stock Units and shares of Stock are issued to the Grantee, the Grantee can sell his or her investment on the NYSE if there are buyers for it. If the Grantee sells his or her investment, the price he or she receives may vary depending on factors such as the financial condition of the Company. The Grantee may receive less than the full amount that he or she paid for it, if anything. 
 
 For information on risk factors impacting the Company s business that may affect the value of the shares of Stock, the Grantee should refer to the risk factors discussion in the Company s annual and quarterly reports, which are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and are available online at www.sec.gov, as well as on the Company s intranet. 
 
 For more details on the terms and conditions of the Restricted Stock Units, please refer to the Agreement, the Plan and the prospectus which can be obtained free of charge on request via email to stock eventbrite.com.

In particular, and without limitation to the provisions of the Plan, the Grantee understands and agrees that any unvested portion of the Restricted Stock Units as of the date of the Grantee s termination of employment will be cancelled without entitlement to the underlying shares of Stock or to any amount as indemnification if the Grantee terminates employment by reason of, including, but not limited to, resignation, retirement, disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause, disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without cause i.e. , subject to a despido improcedente ), individual or collective dismissal on objective grounds, whether adjudged or recognized to be with or without cause, material modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers Statute, relocation under Article 40 of the Workers Statute, and or Article 50 of the Workers Statute, unilateral withdrawal by the Employer and under Article 10.3 of the Royal Decree 1382 1985. 
 
 Finally, the Grantee understands that this grant would not be made to the Grantee but for the assumptions and conditions referred to herein thus, the Grantee acknowledges and freely accepts that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then the grant of the Restricted Stock Units shall be null and void.
