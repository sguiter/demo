 As of September 30, 2024, we have commercial products authorized for use, our COVID-19 vaccine and our RSV vaccine. The RSV vaccine was approved by the FDA in May 2024 for adults aged 60 years and older and we commenced sales of our RSV vaccine in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Prior to the third quarter of 2023, we sold our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. Government, foreign governments and international organizations. The agreements and related amendments with these entities generally do not include variable consideration, such as discounts, rebates or returns. Certain of these agreements entitle us to upfront deposits for our COVID-19 vaccine supply, initially recorded as deferred revenue. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had deferred revenue of million and million, respectively, related to customer deposits for our COVID-19 vaccine. We expect million of our deferred revenue related to customer deposits as of September 30, 2024 to be realized in less than one year. Timing of product delivery and manufacturing, and receipt of marketing approval for the applicable COVID-19 vaccine will determine the period in which product sales are recognized. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2023, we commenced sales of our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. commercial market, in addition to continuing sales to foreign governments and international organizations. We also commenced sales of our RSV vaccine in the third quarter of 2024. In the U.S., our COVID-19 and RSV vaccines are sold primarily to wholesalers and distributors, and to a lesser extent, directly to retailers and healthcare providers. Wholesalers and distributors typically do not make upfront payments to us.

 Grant Revenue 
 
 In April 2020, we entered into an agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), for an award of up to million to accelerate development of mRNA-1273. The agreement has been subsequently amended to provide for additional commitments to support various late-stage clinical development efforts of our original COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, including a participant Phase 3 study, pediatric clinical trials, adolescent clinical trials and pharmacovigilance studies. The maximum award from BARDA, inclusive of all amendments, was approximately billion. All contract options have been exercised. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining available funding, net of revenue earned was million.

 million through the Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle (RRPV), funded by BARDA, to accelerate the development of mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines. The project award will support the late-stage development of an mRNA-based vaccine to enable the licensure of a pre-pandemic vaccine against the H5 influenza virus. This subtype of the influenza virus causes a highly infectious and severe disease in birds known as avian influenza and poses a risk of spillover into the human population. The agreement also includes additional options to prepare for and accelerate responses to future public health threats. We had not recognized any revenue under this agreement as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Licensing and Royalty Revenue 
 
 In April 2024, we entered a non-exclusive out-licensing agreement with a pharmaceutical company based in Japan for mRNA COVID-19-related intellectual property for the territory of Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of million, which included a million prepayment creditable against future royalties. Additionally, we are entitled to receive low double-digit royalties on the net sales of the company s COVID-19 product. 
 
 million of the upfront payment as other revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. The remaining million was recorded as deferred revenue in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. In the third quarter of 2024, we began recognizing royalty revenue by amortizing the deferred revenue as the underlying sales occurred. 

million. Following this exercise, the Merck Participation Term commenced. Pursuant to the agreement, we and Merck have agreed to collaborate on further development and commercialization of INT, with costs and any profits or losses to be shared equally on a worldwide basis. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized expenses, net of Merck's reimbursements, of million and million , respectively, related to the INT collaboration under the Merck Participation Term . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , these expenses were million and million , respectively . 
 
 Additionally, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the net cost recovery for capital expenditures was million and million , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the net cost recovery for capital expenditures was million and million , respectively. These amounts were applied to reduce the capitalized cost of the assets. 
 
 We have other collaborative and licensing arrangements that we do not consider to be individually significant to our business at this time. Pursuant to these agreements, we may be required to make upfront payments and payments upon achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones, which in the aggregate could be significant. Future milestone payments, if any, will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements when the corresponding events have occurred. In addition, we may be required to pay significant royalties on future sales if products related to these arrangements are commercialized. 
 
 Development and Commercialization Funding Arrangement with Blackstone Life Sciences (Blackstone) 
 
 In March 2024, we entered into a development and commercialization funding arrangement with Blackstone, under which Blackstone has committed to providing up to million in funding to us. This funding supports the development of our investigational mRNA-based influenza vaccine. Contingent upon regulatory approval in the U.S. and only if the approval is dependent on data from the funded activities, Blackstone will be entitled to receive low single-digit percentage royalties and up to million in sales milestone payments. These payments are based on net sales of our future influenza and combination vaccines, with sales milestone payments contingent upon achieving specified cumulative net sales targets.

 In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments in investment grade securities with high credit quality issuers, and generally limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We evaluate securities for impairment at the end of each reporting period. Impairment is evaluated considering numerous factors, and their relative significance varies depending on the situation. Factors considered include whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to credit-related factors or non-credit-related factors, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value. Any impairment that is not credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. A credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. We did t recognize any impairment charges related to available-for-sale securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We did t record any credit-related allowance for available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

We neither intend to sell these investments, nor do we believe that we are more-likely-than-not to conclude we will have to sell them before recovery of their carrying values. We also believe that we will be able to collect both principal and interest amounts due to us at maturity. 
 
 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
 
 The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used to value the assets and liabilities: 
 
 Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 
 Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; or 
 Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).

main campuses in Massachusetts, our Cambridge campus and our Moderna Technology Center (MTC), an industrial technology center located in Norwood. We also lease various parcels of land, as well as office, lab, and manufacturing spaces across the globe for our business operations. 
 
 Cambridge Campus 
 
 Our Cambridge campus consists of multiple leased properties, including office and research laboratory spaces totaling approximately square feet, including the Moderna Science Center. 
 
 Moderna Science Center 
 
 In September 2021, we entered into a lease agreement for a building in Cambridge, Massachusetts, comprising approximately square feet. This facility, which includes our principal executive offices along with additional office and laboratory spaces, is referred to as the Moderna Science Center (MSC). After an approximately building project, the lease term is years, with options for additional extensions. During the third quarter of 2023, we commenced the lease and recognized the related right-of-use asset and lease liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Following the commencement of the MSC lease, we amended the expiration dates of our existing leases at Technology Square in the fourth quarter of 2023. Originally scheduled to expire ranging from 2024 to 2029, these leases have been adjusted to conclude by early 2025. All our Cambridge leases are classified as operating leases. 
 
 Moderna Technology Center 
 
 Our MTC is composed of buildings, MTC South, MTC North and MTC East, totaling approximately square feet. Our MTC leases expire in 2042 and we have the option to extend the term for extension periods of each. All of our MTC leases are classified as finance leases. 
 
 In September 2024, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the properties we currently lease in Norwood, Massachusetts, where the MTC is located. The total purchase price for the properties is approximately million. In October 2024, we made a nonrefundable deposit of million as part of the transaction. The closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, with an anticipated closing date in December 2024.

 t experienced any material losses related to these indemnification obligations, and material claims were outstanding. We do not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and, consequently, concluded that the fair value of these obligations is negligible, and related reserves were established. 
 
 Purchase Commitments and Purchase Orders We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with vendors and contract manufacturing organizations for raw materials and manufacturing services and with vendors for preclinical research studies, clinical trials and other goods or services. As of September 30, 2024, we had billion of non-cancelable purchase commitments related to raw materials and manufacturing agreements, which are expected to be paid through 2029. As of September 30, 2024, we had million o f non-c ancelable purchase commitments related to research and development and other goods and services which are expected to be paid through 2031. These amounts represent our minimum contractual obligations, including termination fees. 
 
 In addition to purchase commitments, we have agreements with third parties for various goods and services, including services related to clinical operations and support and contract manufacturing, for which we are not contractually able to terminate for convenience and avoid any and all future obligations to the vendors. Certain agreements provide for termination rights subject to termination fees or winddown costs. Under such agreements, we are contractually obligated to make certain payments to vendors, mainly, to reimburse them for their unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. As of September 30, 2024, we had cancelable open purchase orders of billion in total under such agreements for our significant clinical operations and support and contract manufacturing. These amounts represent only our estimate of those items for which we had a contractual commitment to pay as of September 30, 2024, assuming we would not cancel these agreements. The actual amounts we pay in the future to the vendors under such agreements may differ from the purchase order amounts. 
 Licenses to Patented Technology 
 
 We have patent license agreements with Cellscript, LLC and its affiliate, mRNA RiboTherapeutics, Inc., and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Under these agreements, we are required to pay royalties and certain milestone payments. For further information on our licensing and royalty payments, please refer to our 2023 Form 10-K under the heading Business Intellectual Property In-licensed intellectual property and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained therein. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized million and million, respectively, of royalty expenses associated with our product sales. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized million and million, respectively, of royalty expenses associated with our product sales. These royalty expenses were recorded to cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Additionally, we have other in-license agreements with third parties which require us to make future development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and sales-based royalties for specified products associated with the agreements. The achievement of these milestones have not yet occurred as of September 30, 2024.

) ) ) Provision for income taxes Effective tax rate ) ) ) 
 
 The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the statutory rate, primarily due to our global valuation allowance, which limits our ability to recognize tax benefits from the loss. The higher effective tax rate was also due to certain of our foreign subsidiaries that have taxable income, while we incurred a net loss before income taxes in other jurisdictions. The decrease in our effective tax rate, compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily attributable to the establishment of a billion valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2023. This valuation allowance has been applied consistently since its initial recognition in the third quarter of 2023. For additional details regarding our deferred tax assets and the policies governing our valuation allowance, please refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited financial information and related notes included in this Form 10-Q and our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on February 23, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K). 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a biotechnology company advancing a new class of medicines made of messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA medicines are designed to direct the body s cells to produce intracellular, membrane or secreted proteins that have a therapeutic or preventive benefit with the potential to address a broad spectrum of diseases. Our platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mRNA science, delivery technology and manufacturing, providing us the capability to pursue in parallel a robust pipeline of new development candidates. We are developing therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases and autoimmune diseases, independently and with our strategic collaborators. 
 
 Since our founding in 2010, we have transformed from a research-stage company advancing programs in the field of mRNA to a commercial enterprise with a diverse clinical portfolio of vaccines and therapeutics across several modalities, a broad intellectual property portfolio and integrated manufacturing capabilities that allow for rapid clinical and commercial production at scale. We have a diverse and extensive development pipeline of 36 development candidates across our 45 development programs, of which 42 are in clinical studies currently. 
 
 Our COVID-19 vaccine is our first commercial product and is marketed, where approved, under the name Spikevax . Our original vaccine, mRNA-1273, targeted the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain, and we have leveraged our mRNA platform to rapidly adapt our vaccine to emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains to provide protection as the virus evolves and regulatory guidance is updated. In May 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval for mRESVIA (mRNA-1345), our mRNA vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), to protect adults aged 60 and older from lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV infection. This marks our second approved mRNA product and underscores our ongoing commitment to delivering solutions for patients by addressing global public health threats related to infectious diseases. 
 
 Business Highlights 
 
 COVID-19 
 
 Consistent with guidance from regulators, we updated our COVID-19 vaccine to target the KP.2 and JN.1 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the 2024-2025 season. During the third quarter of 2024, our vaccine targeting the KP.2 strain received approval from the FDA and Health Canada, while our vaccine targeting the JN.1 strain was approved by regulatory authorities in the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, Japan, Taiwan and other jurisdictions. We have since commenced the supply of these vaccines to customers. 
 
 RSV 
 
 In May 2024, the FDA approved mRESVIA to protect adults aged 60 years and older from lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV infection. The approval was granted under a breakthrough therapy designation. Subsequently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued a recommendation for all unvaccinated people 75 years of age and older and unvaccinated people ages 60-74 who are at increased risk. In August 2024, the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for mRESVIA to protect adults aged 60 years and older from lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV infection. The authorization is valid in all 27 EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. We have also filed for mRNA-1345 approval with regulators in multiple markets worldwide and commenced sales in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Moderna's Canadian Manufacturing Facility 
 
 In September 2024, our manufacturing facility in Laval, Quebec, received a Drug Establishment License (DEL) from Health Canada, certifying the site s compliance with the required safety and quality standards to produce drug substance. This certification marked a significant step in enabling our Canadian facility to become fully operational, supporting domestic manufacturing of mRNA vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, with production expected to begin in 2025. 
 
 Net Product Sales and Net Loss Per Share 
 
 For the third quarter of 2024, we recognized net product sales of 1.8 billion from sales of our COVID-19 and RSV vaccines,

 compared to 1.8 billion for the third quarter of 2023. Earnings per share was 0.03 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to loss per share of (9.53) for the third quarter of 2023. 

Recent Program Developments 
 
 Respiratory Virus Vaccines 
 
 RSV . In September 2024, we announced positive Phase 3 results for our RSV vaccine (mRNA-1345) for high-risk adults aged 18 to 59. In the trial, mRNA-1345 met all primary immunogenicity endpoints and the 50 g dose, which is the same for the currently approved mRESVIA vaccine for adults 60 years and above, was well tolerated with no safety concerns identified. 
 
 Next-generation COVID-19 . In September 2024, we shared positive Phase 3 vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity data for our next-generation COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1283). 
 
 Flu . In September 2024, we announced that we are no longer pursuing an accelerated approval pathway for the regulatory submission of our standalone flu vaccine, mRNA-1010, to focus our resources on the submission of a potentially more impactful Flu+COVID combination vaccine, mRNA-1083. In September 2024, we initiated a Phase 3 efficacy study (P304) for mRNA-1010, funded by previously announced project financing through Blackstone Life Sciences. 
 
 We intend to file in 2024 for approval of our next-generation COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1283) and our RSV vaccine (mRNA-1345) for high-risk adults ages 18 to 59. We intend to use priority review vouchers for those programs. For our Flu+COVID combination vaccine (mRNA-1083), we intend to file in 2024, subject to ongoing discussions with the FDA, and we have decided not to use a priority review voucher. 
 
 Latent and Other Virus Vaccines 
 
 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) . We expect to have accrued the 81 cases necessary to trigger the first interim analysis of the Phase 3 vaccine efficacy study of our CMV vaccine candidate (mRNA-1647) by the end of 2024. 
 
 Norovirus . In September 2024, we announced that the first participant in the U.S. had been dosed in the pivotal Phase 3 trial of our investigational mRNA trivalent norovirus vaccine, mRNA-1403. We had previously announced that an interim analysis had shown that a single dose of mRNA-1403 elicited a robust immune response across all dose levels evaluated with a clinically acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile. Additionally, robust histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) blocking antibody titers were observed against vaccine-matched norovirus genogroup I and II selected strains across all dose levels evaluated. Similar mRNA-1403-induced HBGA-blocking antibody titers were observed in younger adult and older adult age groups. 
 
 Oncology Therapeutics 
 
 Individualized neoantigen therapy (INT) . In October 2024, we and Merck initiated a Phase 3 study evaluating adjuvant INT (mRNA-4157) in combination with KEYTRUDA after neoadjuvant KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy in patients with certain types of resected non-small cell lung cancer. This is the third Phase 3 trial for the investigational INT focused on earlier stages of cancer. 
 
 Discontinued Programs 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we announced that five programs in our pipeline have been discontinued due to our strategic prioritization efforts: 
 
 Endemic HCoV (mRNA-1287): The preclinical program will not advance into Phase 1. 
 RSV infants (seronegative,

 As of September 30, 2024, we have two commercial products authorized for use, our COVID-19 vaccine and our RSV vaccine. The RSV vaccine was approved by the FDA in May 2024 for adults aged 60 years and older. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2023, we commenced sales of our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. commercial market, in addition to continuing sales to foreign governments and international organizations. We also commenced sales of our RSV vaccine in the third quarter of 2024. In the U.S., our COVID-19 and RSV vaccines are sold primarily to wholesalers and distributors, and to a lesser extent, directly to retailers and healthcare providers. Net product sales are recognized net of estimated wholesaler chargebacks, invoice discounts for prompt payments and pre-orders, provisions for sales returns and government rebates, and other related deductions.

 _______ 
 (1) Includes an adjustment of approximately 140 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting a reduction in prior period provision estimates, primarily related to returns for the previous COVID-19 vaccine season that closed during the quarter. 
 
 Prior to the third quarter of 2023, we sold our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. Government, foreign governments and international organizations. The agreements and related amendments with these entities generally do not include variable consideration, such as discounts, rebates or returns. Certain of these agreements entitle us to upfront deposits for our COVID-19 vaccine supply, initially recorded as deferred revenue. As of September 30, 2024, we had deferred revenue of 443 million associated with customer deposits received or billable under supply agreements, with the majority of our COVID-19 vaccine deliveries scheduled in 2024. 
 
 Other revenue 
 
 Other revenue comprises grant revenue, collaboration revenue, and licensing and royalty revenue. 
 
 Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 remained relatively flat compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue decreased by 1.8 billion, or 44 , compared to the same period in 2023, mainly due to lower net product sales of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
 
 Net product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 63 million, or 4 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by higher sales in the U.S. market following the earlier launch of our updated COVID-19 vaccine for the season, and an approximately 140 million adjustment related to the reduction in prior period sales provision estimates. With FDA approval granted three weeks earlier than in the previous year, we were able to meet demand more effectively. This increase was partially offset by lower international sales, which in 2023 had benefited from the fulfillment of orders deferred from 2022. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net product sales decreased by 1.7 billion, or 44 , compared to the same period in 2023. This decline reflects the transition of the COVID-19 vaccine market from pandemic-driven demand to a more seasonal commercial pattern, with sales in 2024 exhibiting greater seasonality and reduced overall demand. 
 
 We expect higher demand for our COVID-19 and RSV vaccines in the fall and winter seasons each year across both hemispheres, as countries prepare for seasonal vaccination campaigns. For the full year of 2024, we anticipate further reductions in net product sales 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 for our COVID-19 vaccine compared to 2023 as the market continues to evolve into a seasonal commercial model. Although we commenced sales of our RSV vaccine in the third quarter of 2024, these sales are not expected to have a significant impact on our overall product sales for the year. 
 
 Other revenue decreased by 32 million, or 43 , and 60 million, or 38 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease for the three and nine months ended was mainly due to a reduction in grant revenue under our agreement with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the development of our COVID-19 vaccine, partially offset by an increase in licensing and royalty revenue. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 
 Cost of sales 
 
 Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 514 million, which included third-party royalties of 92 million, inventory write-downs of 214 million, unutilized manufacturing capacity and wind-down costs of 27 million. Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 725 million, which included third-party royalties of 110 million, inventory write-downs of 302 million, primarily related to our finished and semi-finished COVID-19 vaccine inventory and certain raw materials, unutilized manufacturing capacity and wind-down costs of 109 million, and a 57 million benefit from the sale of previously written-down zero-cost inventory. Please refer to Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for inventory related charges. These charges in 2024, other than royalties, were largely driven by customer demand forecast adjustments and commitments related to manufacturing capacity. 
 
 Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.7 billion, or 77 , compared to the same period in 2023. Cost of sales as a percentage of net product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 28 , compared to 128 for the same period in 2023. Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 3.0 billion, or 81 , compared to the same period in 2023. Cost of sales as a percentage of net product sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 33 , compared to 97 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in cost of sales for both the three- and nine-month periods in 2024 was primarily driven by reduced inventory write-downs, unutilized manufacturing capacity, and purchase commitment related cancellation fees. In addition, the reduction reflects the impact of a strategic cost initiative launched in the third quarter of 2023 to optimize our COVID-19 business by resizing manufacturing operations in response to the shift toward an endemic seasonal market. This initiative, which incurred 1.4 billion in charges during the third quarter of 2023, helped drive improved manufacturing efficiency and cost reductions in 2024. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net product sales for both the three- and nine-month periods in 2024 was mainly driven by reduced costs, while the decrease for the nine-month period was partially offset by the lower sales volume, reflecting a decline in product demand and increased seasonality. 
 
 We anticipate that the full year cost of sales as a percentage of net product sales for 2024 will be lower than the 70 experienced in 2023. This expectation is based on projected improvements in our manufacturing efficiency and expected reductions in inventory write-downs. However, due to the strong seasonality of our business, we expect this percentage to be higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter anticipated to be higher than the third quarter. 
 
 Research and development expenses 
 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 23 million, or 2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This reduction was primarily due to decreases in clinical trial expenses of 182 million and clinical manufacturing expenses of 92 million. These decreases were partially offset by the purchase of a priority review voucher, along with a 38 million increase in personnel-related costs and stock-based compensation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses decreased by 18 million, or 1 , compared to the same period in 2023. This reflects a 332 million reduction in clinical trial expenses, a 150 million reduction in clinical manufacturing expenses, and an 85 million reduction in upfront license payments. These reductions were offset by a 193 million increase in personnel-related costs and stock-based compensation, as well as the purchase of two priority review vouchers. The increase in personnel-related costs and stock-based compensation for both periods was driven by higher headcount to support our continued research and development efforts. The decrease in clinical trial expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was mainly due to reduced spending on our COVID-19 and RSV programs. For the nine-month period, the decrease was largely attributable to reduced spending on our COVID-19, RSV and seasonal flu programs, in line with our planned trial schedules. 
 
 We anticipate a modest reduction in research and development expenses in 2024 compared to 2023 levels. We continue to develop our pipeline and advance our product candidates into later-stage development, particularly our ongoing Phase 3 studies. These include our next-generation COVID-19, seasonal flu, CMV, norovirus and combination vaccine programs, as well as our INT program.

Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 161 million, or 36 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction of 105 million in consulting and outside services across all functions, as well as a 36 million reduction in commercial and marketing related expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 256 million, or 24 , compared to the same period in 2023. The decline for the nine-month period was mainly due to a 250 million reduction in consulting and outside services across all functions, along with a 51 million reduction in commercial and marketing related expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a 48 million increase in personnel-related costs and stock-based compensation, primarily driven by an expanded headcount in digital, medical affairs and commercial functions to support our digital and artificial intelligence initiatives, as well as our marketed products. The decrease in both periods reflects cost discipline and efficiencies gained by reducing reliance on external consultants and bringing more functions in-house. 
 
 We anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses in 2024 will be lower than the levels experienced in 2023. This reflects our ongoing commitment to efficiency as we expand our global commercial, regulatory, sales and marketing infrastructure, while continuing to invest in digital capabilities and leverage artificial intelligence technologies. These efforts align with our strategic focus on advancing our program development and enhancing our overall business processes. 
 
 Interest income 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income decreased by 2 million, or 2 , compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income increased by 16 million, or 5 , compared to the same period in 2023. Overall, interest income from our investments in marketable securities remained relatively flat across both periods. The decrease in the three-month period was primarily due to lower average investment balances, while the increase for the nine-month period was driven by the overall higher interest rate environment. 
 
 Other expense, net 
 
 The following tables summarize other expense, net for the periods presented (in millions):

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total other expense, net decreased by 39 million and 27 million, or 76 and 32 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in total other expense, net for the three-month period was primarily driven by a reduction in losses on equity investments. For the nine-month period, the decrease was mainly due to lower losses on available-for-sale debt securities and reduced interest expense, partially offset by an increase in losses on equity investments. Our interest expense is primarily related to our finance leases. Please refer to Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

 Income taxes 
 
 Provision for income taxes decreased by 1.7 billion and 901 million, or 100 and 98 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to the establishment of a 1.7 billion valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2023. This valuation allowance has been applied consistently since its initial recognition in the third quarter of 2023. As a result, we are unable to recognize tax benefits from the loss due to our global valuation allowance. Consequently, the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not comparable to the same periods in the prior year. Please refer to Note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, investments and working capital as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in millions): 
 September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents 1,644 2,907 Investments 5,223 5,697 Investments, non-current 2,335 4,677 Total 9,202 13,281 Working capital: Current assets 9,666 10,325 Current liabilities 2,201 3,015 Total 7,465 7,310 
 
 Our cash, cash equivalents and investments are invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. Investments, consisting primarily of government and corporate debt securities, are stated at fair value. Cash, cash equivalents and investments as of September 30, 2024 decreased by 4.1 billion, or 31 , compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and investments was primarily due to a net cash outflow from operating activities of 3.8 billion and purchases of property and equipment of 529 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Working capital, which is current assets less current liabilities, as of September 30, 2024 increased by 155 million, compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of 672 million, mainly due to timing of collections, a decrease in accrued liabilities and accounts payable of 569 million, driven by lower spend during the period, and an increase in inventory of 210 million, driven by manufacturing of COVID-19 product, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 1.3 billion. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than those obligations and commitments disclosed herein. 
 
 Cash flow 
 
 The following table summarizes the primary sources and uses of cash for each period presented (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by:

 Operating activities 
 
 We derive cash flows from operations primarily from cash collected from customer deposits and accounts receivable related to our product sales, as well as certain government-sponsored and private organizations, strategic alliances and funding arrangements. Our 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our use of cash for operating expenses and working capital to support the business. 
 
 Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, we entered into supply agreements with the U.S. Government, foreign governments and international organizations for the supply of our COVID-19 vaccine and received upfront deposits. In the third quarter of 2023, we commenced sales of our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. commercial market, in addition to continuing sales to foreign governments and international organizations. In the U.S., our COVID-19 vaccine is sold primarily to wholesalers and distributors, and to a lesser extent, directly to retailers and healthcare providers. We also commenced sales of our RSV vaccine in the third quarter of 2024. Wholesalers and distributors typically do not make upfront payments to us. As of September 30, 2024, we had 443 million in deferred revenue related to customer deposits received or billable. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.8 billion and consisted of net loss of 2.4 billion, non-cash adjustments of 427 million and a net change in assets and liabilities of 1.8 billion. Non-cash items primarily included stock-based compensation of 325 million, and depreciation and amortization of 129 million. The net change in assets and liabilities was mainly due to an increase in accounts receivable of 672 million driven by timing of invoicing, a decrease in accrued liabilities and accounts payable of 518 million, driven by overall lower spend in the period, an increase in inventory of 208 million, driven by manufacturing of COVID-19 products, and a decrease in deferred revenue of 177 million due to revenue recognized in excess of customer deposits received. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities increased by 89 million, or 2 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily attributable to a change in deferred income taxes of 934 million driven by an increase in valuation allowance, a change in prepaid expense and other assets of 919 million mainly related to prepayment of clinical studies and contract manufacturing organization activities, a change in inventory of 670 million driven by less inventory write-downs, partially offset by a decrease in net loss of 2.5 billion. 
 
 Investing activities 
 
 Our primary investing activities consist of purchases, sales, and maturities of our investments, capital expenditures for land, building, leasehold improvements, manufacturing, laboratory, computer equipment and software, and business development. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.5 billion, which primarily included proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of 7.7 billion, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of 4.6 billion, and purchases of property and equipment of 529 million. 
 
 Net investing cash flows decreased by 2.3 billion, or 48 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in purchases of marketable securities of 2.5 billion. 
 
 Financing activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 59 million, primarily due to proceeds from issuance of common stock through equity plans of 55 million. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased by 1.3 billion, or 105 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, mainly due to a decrease in repurchases of common stock of 1.2 billion. 
 
 Operation and funding requirements 
 
 Our principal sources of funding as of September 30, 2024 consisted of cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash we may generate from operations. We generated net income of 8.4 billion and 12.2 billion for the years ended in 2022 and 2021, respectively, following the authorization of our first commercial product in December 2020. From our inception to the end of 2020, we incurred significant losses from operations due to our significant research and development expenses. We also incurred a net loss of 2.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a net loss of 4.7 billion for the year ended 2023. We have retained earnings of 11.2 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We have significant future capital requirements including expected operating expenses to conduct research and development activities, operate our organization, and meet capital expenditure needs. We anticipate maintaining substantial expenses across all areas of our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue research and development of our development candidates and clinical activities for our investigational medicines. This also extends to our manufacturing costs, including our arrangements with our supply and manufacturing partners. Our ongoing work on our RSV, seasonal flu, CMV and norovirus vaccine candidates, individualized neoantigen therapy, next generation COVID-19 vaccine, combination vaccines, late-stage clinical development, investments in digital 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 capabilities and artificial intelligence technologies, and buildout of global commercial, regulatory, sales and marketing infrastructure and manufacturing facilities will require significant cash outflows in future periods, most of which will not be reimbursed or otherwise paid for by our partners or collaborators. In addition, we have substantial facility, lease and purchase obligations (refer to Note 10 and Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements). We have entered into various collaboration and licensing agreements, as well as a research and development funding arrangement with third parties. These arrangements collectively encompass the funding of specific research and development activities, with the distinction that under the research and development funding arrangement, we receive funding. However, for all these arrangements, we may be obligated to make potential future milestone and royalty payments. 
 
 We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of September 30, 2024, together with cash expected to be generated from product sales, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our projected operations and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. We are subject to all the risks related to the development and commercialization of novel medicines, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors, which may adversely affect our business. For example, we experienced a decline in customer demand for our COVID-19 vaccine in 2023, and this trend continued into 2024, reflecting the market's ongoing transition to a seasonal commercial pattern in the endemic COVID-19 vaccine market. We foresee that our commitment to investing in our business for future product launches may lead to continued negative cash flows from operations in upcoming periods. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. 
 
 Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 
 
 There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, other than disclosed within Note 5 , Note 10 and Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments from those described under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Our market risks, and the way we manage them, are summarized in Part II, Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our market risk or to our management of such risks for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Except for a change in our logistics provider to support vaccine distribution and order management, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by the collusion of two or more people or by a management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

PART II 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered ordinary course in our business, including the intellectual property litigation described in our 2023 Form 10-K under the heading Legal Proceedings. Most of the issues raised by these claims are highly complex and subject to substantial uncertainties. For a description of risks relating to these and other legal proceedings we face, see Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, of our 2023 Form 10-K, including the discussion under the headings entitled Risks related to our intellectual property and Risks related to the manufacturing of our commercial products and product candidates. The outcome of any such proceedings, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain; therefore, assessing the likelihood of loss and any estimated damages is difficult and subject to considerable judgment. 
 
 Proceedings Related to Patents Owned by Alnylam 
 
 As previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K, in May 2023, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting three U.S. patents concerning cationic lipids. In November 2023, the District Court entered an order of partial dismissal with respect to two of the patents at issue. Subsequently, in October 2024, the District Court entered a final judgment of non-infringement in our favor with respect to the third patent at issue. The decision is subject to appeal. 
 
 Proceedings Related to Patents Owned by GSK 
 
 COVID-19 Vaccines

Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, an Offering will begin on the first business day occurring on or after each January 1 st and July 1 st and will end on the last business day occurring on or before the following May 31 st and November 30 th , respectively. The Administrator may, in its discretion, designate a different period for any Offering, provided that no Offering shall exceed 27 months in duration or overlap any other Offering. 
 
 3. Eligibility . All individuals classified as employees on the payroll records of the Company and each Designated Company are eligible to participate in any one or more of the Offerings under the Plan, provided that as of the first day of the applicable Offering (the Offering Date they are customarily employed by the Company or a Designated Company for 20 hours or more a week, unless the exclusion of employees who do not meet this requirement is not permissible under applicable law, and have completed at least 30 days of employment. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, individuals who are not contemporaneously classified as employees of the Company or a Designated Company for purposes of the Company s or applicable Designated Company s payroll system are not considered to be eligible employees of the Company or any Designated Company and shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan. In the event any such individuals are reclassified as employees of the Company or a Designated Company for any purpose, including, without limitation, common law or statutory employees, by any action of any third party, including, without limitation, any government agency, or as a result of any private lawsuit, action or administrative proceeding, such individuals shall, notwithstanding such reclassification, remain ineligible for participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive means for individuals who are not contemporaneously classified as employees of the Company or a Designated Company on the Company s or 

Designated Company s payroll system to become eligible to participate in a plan which is equivalent to this Plan is through the adoption of a subplan, which specifically renders such individuals eligible to participate therein. 
 
 4. Participation . 
 (a) Participants . An eligible employee who is not a Participant in any prior Offering may participate in a subsequent Offering by submitting (either in electronic or written form, according to procedures established by the Company) an enrollment form to his or her appropriate payroll location at least 5 business days before the Offering Date (or by such other deadline as shall be established by the Administrator for the Offering). 
 (b) Enrollment . The enrollment form will (a) state a whole percentage to be contributed from an eligible employee s Compensation (as defined in Section 11) per pay period, (b) authorize the purchase of Common Stock in each Offering in accordance with the terms of the Plan and (c) specify the exact name or names in which shares of Common Stock purchased for such individual are to be issued or transferred pursuant to Section 10. An employee who does not enroll in accordance with these procedures will be deemed to have waived the right to participate. Unless a Participant submits (either in electronic or written form, according to procedures established by the Company) a new enrollment form or withdraws from the Plan, such Participant s contributions and purchases will continue at the same percentage of Compensation for future Offerings, provided he or she remains eligible. 
 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, participation in the Plan will neither be permitted nor be denied contrary to the requirements of the Code and any applicable law. 
 5. Employee Contributions . Each eligible employee may authorize payroll deductions at a minimum of 1 percent up to a maximum of 15 percent of such employee s Compensation for each pay period provided, however, that if payroll deductions are not permitted or problematic under applicable law or for administrative reasons, the Company, in its discretion, may allow eligible employees to contribute to the Plan by other means. The Company will maintain book accounts showing the amount of payroll deductions or other contributions made by each Participant for each Offering. No interest will accrue or be paid on payroll deductions or other contributions, unless required under applicable law. 
 
 6. Contribution Changes . Except as may be determined by the Administrator in advance of an Offering, a Participant may not increase his or her contributions during any Offering and may only decrease his or her contributions once during any Offering. However, during an Offering, a Participant may increase or decrease his or her contributions with respect to the next Offering (subject to the limitations of Section 5) by submitting (either in electronic or written form, according to procedures established by the Company) a new enrollment form at least 5 business days before the next Offering Date (or by such other deadline as shall be established by the Administrator for the Offering). The Administrator may, in advance of any Offering, establish rules permitting a Participant to increase, decrease or terminate his or her contributions during an Offering. 
 7. Withdrawal . A Participant may withdraw from participation in the Plan by submitting a notice of withdrawal to his or her appropriate payroll location (either in electronic or written form, according to procedures established by the Company). The Participant s withdrawal will be effective if submitted at least 10 business days prior to the end of the Offering period. Following a Participant s withdrawal, the Company will promptly refund such individual s entire account balance under the Plan to him or her (after payment for any Common Stock purchased before the effective date of withdrawal). Partial withdrawals are not permitted. Such an employee may not begin participation again during the remainder of the Offering, but may enroll in a subsequent Offering in accordance with Section 4. 
 
 8. Grant of Options . On each Offering Date, the Company will grant to each eligible employee who is then a Participant in the Plan an option Option to purchase on the last day of such Offering (the Exercise Date ), at the Option Price hereinafter provided for, the lowest of (a) a number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing such Participant s accumulated contributions on such Exercise Date by the lower of (i) 85 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Offering Date, or (ii) 85 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Exercise Date, (b) 3,000 shares or (c) such other lesser maximum number of shares as shall have been established by the Administrator in advance of the Offering provided, however, that such Option shall be subject to the limitations set forth below. Each Participant s Option shall be exercisable only to the extent of such Participant s accumulated payroll deductions and or other contributions on the Exercise Date. The purchase price for 
 2 

each share purchased under each Option (the Option Price will be 85 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Offering Date or the Exercise Date, whichever is less. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Participant may be granted an Option hereunder if such Participant, immediately after the Option was granted, would be treated as owning stock possessing 5 percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary (as defined in Section 11). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply in determining the stock ownership of a Participant, and all stock which the Participant has a contractual right to purchase shall be treated as stock owned by the Participant. In addition, no Participant may be granted an Option which permits his or her rights to purchase stock under the Plan, and any other employee stock purchase plan of the Company and its Parents and Subsidiaries, to accrue at a rate which exceeds 25,000 of the fair market value of such stock (determined on the Option grant date or dates) for each calendar year in which the Option is outstanding at any time. The purpose of the limitation in the preceding sentence is to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and shall be applied taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted. 
 
 9. Exercise of Option and Purchase of Shares . Each employee who continues to be a Participant in the Plan on the Exercise Date shall be deemed to have exercised his or her Option on such date and shall acquire from the Company such number of whole shares of Common Stock reserved for the purpose of the Plan as his or her accumulated contributions on such date will purchase at the Option Price, subject to any other limitations contained in the Plan. Any amount remaining in a Participant s account at the end of an Offering solely by reason of the inability to purchase a fractional share will be carried forward to the next Offering any other balance remaining in a Participant s account at the end of an Offering will be refunded to the Participant promptly. 
 If a Participant has more than one Option outstanding under the Plan, unless he or she otherwise indicates in agreements or notices delivered hereunder (i) each agreement or notice delivered by that Participant shall be deemed to apply to all of his or her Options under the Plan and (ii) an Option with a lower Option Price (or an earlier granted Option, if different Options have identical Option Prices) shall be exercised to the fullest possible extent before an Option with a higher Option Price (or a later granted Option if different Options have identical Option Prices) shall be exercised. 
 10. Issuance of Certificates . Certificates, or book entries for uncertificated shares, representing shares of Common Stock purchased under the Plan may be issued only in the name of the employee or, if permitted by the Administrator, in the name of the employee and another person of legal age as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, or in the name of a broker authorized by the employee to be his, her or their, nominee for such purpose.

An employee will not be deemed to have terminated employment for this purpose, if the employee is on an approved leave of absence for military service or sickness or for any other purpose approved by the Company, if the employee s right to reemployment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was granted or if the Administrator otherwise provides in writing. 
 13. Special Rules . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrator may adopt special rules applicable to the employees of a particular Designated Company, whenever the Administrator determines that such rules are necessary or appropriate for the implementation of the Plan in a jurisdiction where such Designated Company has employees provided that if such rules are inconsistent with the requirements of Section 423(b) of the Code, these employees will participate in the Non-423 Component.

 19. Insufficient Shares .

 20. Termination of the Plan . The Plan may be terminated at any time by the Board. Upon termination of the Plan, all amounts in the accounts of Participants shall be promptly refunded.

The Company s obligation to sell and deliver Common Stock under the Plan is subject to completion of any registration or qualification of the Common Stock under any U.S. or non-U.S. local, state or federal securities or exchange control law or under rulings or regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC or of any other governmental regulatory body, and to obtaining any approval or other clearance from any U.S. and non-U.S. local, state or federal governmental agency, which registration, qualification or approval the Company shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable. The Company is under no obligation to register or qualify the Common Stock with the SEC or any other U.S. or non-U.S. securities commission or to seek approval or clearance from any governmental authority for the issuance or sale of such stock. 
 22. Governing Law . This Plan and all Options and actions taken thereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as to matters within the scope thereof, and as to all other matters shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, applied without regard to conflict of law principles.

 (a) make a payment to the Company, or otherwise as the Company directs, of an amount equal to the Company s estimate of the amount of the Tax Liability or 
 (b) enter into arrangements acceptable to the Company to secure that such payment is made (whether by surrender of shares of Common Stock, net share issuance, the sale of shares of Common Stock or otherwise). 
 For these purposes, Tax Liability shall mean any amount of U.S. or non-U.S. federal, state or local income tax, social security (or similar) contributions, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account and or other tax-related items related to the participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Participant, which the Company and or an Affiliate or Subsidiary become liable to pay on the Participant s behalf to the relevant authorities in any jurisdiction. 
 25. Notification Upon Sale of Shares . Each Participant who is subject to tax in the United States with respect to his or her participation in the Plan agrees, by entering the Plan, to give the Company prompt notice of any disposition of shares purchased under the Plan where such disposition occurs within two years after the date of grant of the Option pursuant to which such shares were purchased or within one year after the date such shares were purchased. 
 26. Effective Date and Approval of Shareholders . The Plan shall take effect on the date immediately preceding the date of the Company s Initial Public Offering, subject to approval by the holders of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present or by written consent of the stockholders.
