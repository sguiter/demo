Closing balance at September 30, 2024 

In relation to the acquisition of QGP Qu mica Geral S.A. QGP in December 2023, the fair value of the acquired net assets was revised in the second quarter of 2024. As a result of the remeasurement period adjustments, there was an increase of million in the fair value of the net assets acquired, with a corresponding decrease to the acquired goodwill. The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed ends as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available but does not exceed twelve months. We completed our alignment of the accounting policies and fair value adjustments in the second quarter and are not expecting further changes at this time. The exchange effect for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million relating to our Performance Chemicals segment.

The amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million (nine months ended September 30, 2023 million). In relation to the acquisition of QGP in December 2023, management finalized the valuation of customer lists which has increased the intangible asset capitalized by million in the second quarter of 2024. Management also revised the expected useful life of the customer lists from years to years. In 2024, we have capitalized million in relation to our internally developed software for a new Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system covering our EMEA and ASPAC regions. The expenses capitalized include the acquisition costs for the software as well as the external and internal costs of the development.

million of historical costs which the Company had incurred in relation to the UK Plan. The recovered costs have been included within the service credit in the table below. The Company also maintains an unfunded defined benefit pension plan covering certain current and former employees in Germany (the German plan ).

The amortization of prior service cost and actuarial net gains are a reclassification out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into other income and expense. In addition, we have obligations for post-employment benefits in some of our other European businesses. As at September 30, 2024, we have recorded a liability of million (December 31, 2023 million).

All of the million of unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties would impact our effective tax rate if recognized. In 2021 a non-U.S. subsidiary, Innospec Limited, entered into a review by the U.K. tax authorities under the U.K. s Profit Diversion Compliance Facility PDCF in relation to the period 2017 to 2020 inclusive . The Company has determined that additional tax, interest and penalties totaling million will arise as a consequence of the review. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company and the U.K. tax authorities reached agreement on this position, and the liability was settled. The liability which was agreed on ultimate settlement was consistent with the amount recorded as a liability, and this item has been released from unrecognized tax benefits and recognized in income taxes. In 2018 the Company recorded an unrecognized tax benefit in relation to a potential adjustment that could arise as a consequence of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 Tax Act ), but for which retrospective adjustment to the filed 2017 U.S. federal income tax returns was not permissible. The Company has determined that additional tax, interest and penalties totaling million may arise in relation to this item. This includes an increase in interest accrued of million in the nine months to September 30, 2024. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that there will be a decrease of million unrecognized tax benefits during the fourth quarter of 2024 in relation to this item due to a lapse of the statute of limitations. A non-U.S. subsidiary, Innospec Performance Chemicals Italia Srl, has been subject to an ongoing tax audit in relation to the period 2011 to 2014 inclusive. The Company had determined that additional tax, interest and penalties totaling million will arise as a consequence of the tax audit. As any additional tax arising as a consequence of the tax audit is to be reimbursed by the previous owner under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, an indemnification asset of the same amount is recorded in the financial statements to reflect this arrangement. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company submitted documentation to the tax authorities confirming its acceptance of the previously disputed position, and due to imminent settlement, this item was released from unrecognized tax benefits and recognized in accrued income taxes in that quarter. As of September 30, 2024, the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries remain open to examination by the IRS for certain elements of 2017 year and for years 2020 onwards under the statute of limitations . The Company s subsidiaries in foreign tax jurisdictions are open to examination including Brazil (2019 onwards), Germany (2019 onwards), and the U.K. (2022 onwards).

t drawn down on its revolving credit facility. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the Company did t draw down or repay any borrowing on its revolving credit facility. The Company continues to have available a million multicurrency revolving credit facility (the "Facility") until . The Facility contains an accordion feature whereby the Company may elect to increase the total available borrowings by an aggregate amount of up to million. Effective as of May 20, 2024, the termination date of the Facility was extended from May 30, 2027 to in accordance with the terms of the Company s multicurrency revolving facility agreement (the Facility Agreement ). No other terms of the Facility Agreement or the Facility were modified. The Company paid a customary extension fee in connection with the extension of the Facility as contemplated by the Facility Agreement. As at September 30, 2024, the deferred finance costs of million (December 31, 2023 - million) related to the arrangement of the credit facility, are included within other current and non-current assets at the balance sheet dates.

Acquisition-related contingent consideration 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Emissions Trading Scheme credits: The fair value is determined by the open market pricing at the end of the reporting period. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: The fair value of derivatives relating to foreign currency forward exchange contracts are derived from current settlement prices and comparable contracts using current assumptions. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily relate to contracts entered into to hedge future known transactions or hedge balance sheet net cash positions. The movements in the carrying amounts and fair values of these contracts are largely due to changes in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Acquisition-related contingent consideration: Contingent consideration payable in cash is discounted to its fair value at each balance sheet date. Where contingent consideration is dependent upon pre-determined financial targets, an estimate of the fair value of the likely consideration payable is made at each balance sheet date. The contingent consideration payable has been calculated based on the latest forecast.

million (December 31, 2023 - million). The remaining terms of the fixed maturity guarantees are up to years, with some further guarantees having no fixed expiry date. Under the terms of the guarantee arrangements, generally the Company would be required to perform the obligations should the affiliated company fail to fulfill its obligations under the arrangements. In some cases, the guarantee arrangements have recourse provisions that would enable the Company to recover any payments made under the terms of the guarantees from securities held of the guaranteed parties assets. The Company and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Company.

million and million, respectively. The compensation cost recorded for stock equivalent units for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. The compensation cost recorded for stock options for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was million and 5 million, respectively. The compensation cost recorded for stock equivalent units for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively.

Nonvested at September 30, 2024 

For the awards granted with market conditions, a Monte Carlo model has been used to calculate the grant-date fair value. For all other awards granted, a fair market value methodology has been used to calculate the grant-date fair value. The awards granted with market conditions include a performance measure for Innospec's total shareholder return as compared to a peer group of companies. This measure can result in a maximum vesting for the number of stock options granted. The maximum potential vesting has been reflected in the grant-date fair value calculation, but not reflected for the number of awards granted, as shown in the table above. All other awards granted in the quarter have similar vesting conditions to those granted in the previous periods. As of September 30, 2024, there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years.

Higher sales volumes for all our regions were driven by increased demand for our personal care and home care products resulting from higher consumer demand, in particular for lower priced higher volume products. The acquisition of the QGP business has also delivered increased volumes year over year. All our regions recorded an adverse price and product mix due to lower selling prices, driven by lower raw material costs, together with the greater demand from consumers for lower priced products. 
 Gross margin: the year over year increase of 1.2 percentage points was due to margins returning to a more normalized level when compared to the depressed margins in the prior year. Margins have benefited from raw materials pricing reductions in the current year, combining with the favorable impact for our manufacturing efficiency due to the higher production volumes. 
 20 

Operating expenses: increased 2.7 million year over year due to higher selling expenses, increased amortization for the acquired intangible assets relating to our QGP acquisition and higher performance-related remuneration accruals.

Sales volumes in all our regions have increased year over year due to increased demand from customers. Price and product mix was adverse in all our regions, with a favorable sales mix being offset by lower pricing resulting from lower raw material costs. AvGas volumes were lower than the prior year due to variations in the demand from customers. 
 Gross margin : the year over year increase of 2.3 percentage points was driven by an improved sales mix from increased sales of higher margin products, together with the easing of raw material and other inflationary pressures. 
 Operating expenses: the year over year decrease of 0.6 million was primarily due to lower provisions for doubtful debts. 
 Oilfield Services 
 Net sales: have decreased year over year by 35.6 million, or 24 percent, with the majority of our customer activity concentrated in the Americas region. Sales volumes were adversely impacted by significantly lower production chemical activity in 2024. Management expects to see lower sales volumes continuing in production chemicals for the remainder of 2024, with the potential for demand to recover over the near-term, combined with the potential for growth opportunities for our other oilfield markets. 
 Gross margin: the year over year decrease of 7.7 percentage points was due to an unfavorable sales mix as customer demand has weakened. 
 Operating expenses: the year over year decrease of 12.3 million was driven by the lower customer service costs and commissions related to the reduced demand from certain customers. 
 Other Income Statement Captions 
 Corporate costs: the year over year decrease of 7.2 million was primarily due to the 8.4 million recovery of historical costs which the Company incurred relating to our defined benefit pension scheme in the U.K., being partly offset by higher performance-related remuneration accruals.

Interest income/(expense), net: in the third quarter of 2024 was 2.7 million of income compared to 0.8 million of income in the third quarter of 2023, driven by the higher interest income being earned in 2024 for our increasing cash balances. 
 
 Income taxes: the effective tax rate was 25.4 and 17.5 in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The adjusted effective tax rate, once adjusted for the items set out in the following table, was 24.6 in 2024 compared with 17.6 in 2023. The 7.0 percentage points increase in the adjusted effective rate was primarily due to the geographical mix of profits and the prior year comparatives being significantly impacted by foreign currency fluctuations. The Company believes that this adjusted effective tax rate, a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors and may assist them in evaluating the Company s underlying performance and identifying operating trends. In addition, management uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally to evaluate the performance of the Company s operations and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods.

Sales volumes in all our regions have increased year over year due to increased demand from customers. Price and product mix was adverse in all our regions, with a favorable sales mix being offset by lower pricing resulting from lower raw material costs. AvGas volumes were higher than the prior year due to variations in the demand from customers, together with a favorable price and product mix due to a higher proportion of sales being made to higher margin customers. 
 Gross margin : the year over year increase of 3.9 percentage points was driven by an improved sales mix from increased sales of higher margin products, together with the easing of raw material and other inflationary pressures and the adverse impact of the Brazil inventory misappropriation and associated costs of exiting the trading relationship in the prior year.

Interest income/(expense), net: in the first nine months of 2024 was 6.9 million of income, compared to 0.8 million of income in the first nine months of 2023. Interest income from our cash balances has increased over recent periods due to higher central bank interest rates together with the increases in our cash balances. 
 
 Income taxes: the effective tax rate was 26.3 and 21.5 in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The adjusted effective tax rate, once adjusted for the items set out in the following table, was 25.7 in 2024 compared with 21.4 in 2023.

LIQUIDI TY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Working Capital 
 In the first nine months of 2024 our working capital increased by 78.3 million, while our adjusted working capital decreased by 12.0 million. The difference is primarily due to the exclusion of the increases for cash and cash equivalents, together with the changes for prepaid income taxes and the current portion of accrued income taxes. 
 The Company believes that adjusted working capital, a non-GAAP financial measure (defined by the Company as trade and other accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued liabilities rather than total current assets less total current liabilities) provides useful information to investors in evaluating the Company s underlying performance and identifying operating trends. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of the Company s operations. Items excluded from working capital in the adjusted working capital calculation are listed in the table below and represent factors which do not fluctuate in line with the day to day working capital needs of the business.

We had a 32.2 million decrease in trade and other accounts receivable driven by positive cash collections and lower sales in our Oilfield segment. Days sales outstanding decreased in our Performance Chemicals segment from 64 days to 61 days; increased from 55 days to 57 days in our Fuel Specialties segment; and increased from 55 days to 70 days in our Oilfield Services segment. 
 We had a 19.2 million increase in inventories, including a 6.8 million increase in allowances, driven primarily by higher levels of raw materials together with higher levels of finished goods in advance of the expected sales increases in the fourth quarter. The Company continues to maintain inventory levels necessary to manage the risk of potential supply chain disruption for certain key raw materials, especially in our Fuel Specialties segment. Days sales in inventory in our Performance Chemicals segment increased from 62 days to 64 days; increased from 121 days to 149 days in our Fuel Specialties segment; and increased from 48 days to 64 days in our Oilfield Services segment. 
 Prepaid expenses decreased 9.5 million, from 18.7 million to 9.2 million, primarily due to the normal expensing of prepaid invoices. 
 We had a 10.5 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, which was dependent on the timing of payments for each of our reporting segments and combined with the lower sales in our Oilfield segment. Creditor days (including goods received not invoiced) have increased in our Performance Chemicals segment from 45 days to 48 days; increased from 41 days to 57 days in our Fuel Specialties segment; and increased from 48 days to 55 days in our Oilfield Services segment. The increases for creditor days have been impacted by the timing of sales and cost of sales in the quarter, when using a countback methodology. 
 
 26 

Operating Cash Flows 
 We generated cash from operating activities of 158.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 134.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was related to increased operating income and favorable income tax changes year over year, being partly offset by less favorable working capital cash flows primarily related to the increased inventory levels needed to secure the supply of certain raw materials. 
 Cash 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 303.8 million and 203.7 million, respectively, of which 128.2 million and 59.8 million, respectively, were held by non-U.S. subsidiaries principally in the United Kingdom. 
 The increase in cash and cash equivalents of 100.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 was driven by our positive trading cash flow, being partly offset by our continued investments in capital projects and the payment of our semi-annual dividend. 
 Debt 
 We continue to have available a 250.0 million multicurrency revolving credit facility (the Facility ), which contains an accordion feature whereby we may elect to increase the total available borrowings by an aggregate amount of up to 125.0 million. Effective as of May 20, 2024, the termination date of the Facility was extended from May 30, 2027 to May 31, 2028 in accordance with the terms of our multicurrency revolving facility agreement (the Facility Agreement ). No other terms of the Facility Agreement or the Facility were modified. We paid a customary extension fee in connection with the extension of the Facility as contemplated by the Facility Agreement. 
 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had no debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility and no obligations were outstanding under finance leases. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Item 3 Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures about Market Risk 
 The Company uses floating rate debt to finance its global operations. The Company is subject to business risks inherent in non-U.S. activities, including political and economic uncertainty, import and export limitations, and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The political and economic risks are mitigated by the stability of the major countries in which the Company s largest operations are located. Credit limits, ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures are used to minimize bad debt risk. Collateral is not generally required. 
 From time to time, the Company uses derivatives, including interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts, in the normal course of business to manage market risks. The derivatives used in hedging activities are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes. In addition, the Company enters into derivative instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage the exposure to non-performance of such instruments. The Company s objective in managing the exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. The Company s objective in managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with such changes. 
 The Company offers fixed prices for some long-term sales contracts. As manufacturing and raw material costs are subject to variability, the Company, from time to time, uses commodity swaps to hedge the cost of some raw materials thus reducing volatility on earnings and cash flows. The derivatives are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes. The Company s objective is to manage its exposure to fluctuating costs of raw materials. 
 The Company s exposure to market risk has been discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K and there have been no significant changes since that time.

Item 4 Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Based on an evaluation carried out as of the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The Company is continuously seeking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations and of its internal control over financial reporting. This is intended to result in refinements to processes throughout the Company. 
 As previously disclosed, we are continuing with the development of a new, company-wide, information system platform which began in 2022. The new platform provider is well established in the market. The implementation is a phased, risk-managed, site deployment following a multistage user acceptance program with the existing platform providing a fallback position. We implemented the new platform for a number of our sites across EMEA and ASPAC in the third quarter of 2024. In connection with this implementation, the Company has updated its internal controls over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to its business processes and accounting procedures. 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting which were identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER IN FORMATION 
 Item 1 Legal Pr oceedings 
 Le g al matters 
 We are involved from time to time in claims and legal proceedings that result from, and are incidental to, the conduct of our business including business and commercial litigation, employee and product liability claims. 
 As reported in the 2023 Form 10-K, we have incurred financial losses and lodged a civil and criminal legal claim related to a misappropriation of inventory in Brazil. As at the time of filing, there have been no significant developments to report in relation to the claims being made. Consistent with prior quarters, a corresponding asset for the potential legal or insurance recoveries has not been recorded for the resulting financial losses arising from this matter. 
 In addition, unrelated to the Brazil matter, in the unlikely event there are an unexpectedly large number of individual claims or proceedings with an adverse resolution, this could in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the results of operations for a particular year or quarter. 
 Item 1A Risk F actors 
 Information regarding risk factors that could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition are described under Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of our 2023 Form 10-K. In management s view, there have been no material changes in the risk factors facing the Company as disclosed in those SEC filings. 
 Item 2 Unregistered Sale s of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 There have been no unregistered sales of equity securities. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not purchase any of its common stock as part of its share repurchase program announced on February 15, 2022. The repurchase program allows for up to 50 million of the Company s common stock to be repurchased in the open market over a three-year period commencing on February 16, 2022. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the company did not repurchase its common stock in connection with the exercising of stock options by directors and employees. 
 Item 3 Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 None. 
 Item 4 Mine Saf ety Disclosures
