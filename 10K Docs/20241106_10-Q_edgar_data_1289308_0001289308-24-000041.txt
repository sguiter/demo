 Allowance for doubtful accounts Accounts receivable, net 
 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a Receivables Purchase Agreement (RPA), under which the Company continuously sells its interest in designated pools of trade accounts receivables, at a discount, to a special purpose entity, which in turn sells certain of the receivables to an unaffiliated financial institution ("unaffiliated financial institution") on a monthly basis. The Company may sell certain US-originated accounts receivable balances up to a maximum amount of . In return for these sales, the Company receives a cash payment equal to the face value of the receivables and is charged a fee of Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus basis points against the sold receivable balance. The program is conducted through EnerSys Finance LLC ("EnerSys Finance"), an entity structured to be bankruptcy remote, and matures in December 2025. The Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of EnerSys Finance as the Company has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity from the transfer of the trade accounts receivables into the special purpose entity. Accordingly, EnerSys Finance is included in the Company s Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 Receivables sold to unaffiliated financial institutions under the program are excluded from Accounts receivable, net on the Company s Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets, and cash receipts are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows. The purchase price is received in cash when the receivables are sold, and fees charged relating to this balance are recorded to other (income) expense. Certain unsold receivables held by EnerSys Finance serve as collateral to unaffiliated financial institutions. These unsold receivables are included in Accounts receivable, net in the Company s Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. The Company continues servicing the receivables which were sold and in exchange receives a servicing fee from EnerSys Finance under the program. 
 
 During the second quarter and the six months of fiscal 2025, the Company sold and , respectively, of accounts receivables for approximately and , respectively, in proceeds to an unaffiliated financial institution, of which and , respectively, were collected as of September 29, 2024.

 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
 
 The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of the Company s foreign currency exposures for lead, as well as other foreign currency exposures so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the underlying foreign currency denominated exposures. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. As of September 29, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company had entered into a total of and , respectively, of such contracts. 
 
 Interest Rate Swap Agreements 
 
 The Company is exposed to changes in variable interest rates on borrowings under our credit agreement. On a selective basis, from time to time, it enters into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt. At September 29, 2024 and March 31, 2024 such agreements effectively convert of our variable-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis, utilizing the one-month term SOFR, as a floating rate reference. Fluctuations in SOFR and fixed rates affect both our net financial investment position and the amount of cash to be paid or received by us under these agreements.

, maturing on December 15, 2027. Additionally, on July 2, 2024, the Company entered into cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of , maturing on January 15, 2029. The cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts qualify for hedge accounting as a net investment hedging instrument, which allows for them to be remeasured to foreign currency translation adjustment within AOCI Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income to offset the translation risk from those investments. Balances in the foreign currency translation adjustment accounts remain until the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity, upon which they are recognized as a component of other income (expense). 
 
 Impact of Hedging Instruments on AOCI 
 
 In the coming twelve months, the Company anticipates that of pretax loss relating to lead, foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges will be reclassified from AOCI as part of cost of goods sold and interest expense. This amount represents the current net unrealized impact of hedging lead, foreign exchange rates and interest rates, which will change as market rates change in the future. This amount will ultimately be realized in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income as an offset to the corresponding actual changes in lead, foreign exchange rates and interest costs resulting from variable lead cost, foreign exchange and interest rates hedged. 
 
 Derivatives not Designated in Hedging Relationships 
 
 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
 
 The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany loans and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. These are not designated as hedging instruments and changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded directly in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income. As of September 29, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the notional amount of these contracts was and , respectively.

The financial results contributed from this business are reported within our Specialty line of business. 
 
 Economic Climate 
 
 Global economic conditions are mixed with the impacts of elevated interest rates and heightened geopolitical tensions having various levels of impacts in North America, China and EMEA. The war in Ukraine continues to have widespread economic repercussions, particularly in Europe. The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict is disrupting stability in the Middle East, raising significant concerns about the potential for further escalation across the region. Inflation in North America, China and EMEA, while somewhat more controlled compared to the sharp increases in 2023, remains a challenge with some signs of cooling in the U.S. and Europe. Interest rate cuts of 50 basis points by the Federal Reserve in September are expected to be followed by further rate cuts at the end of the calendar year. The European Central Bank (ECB) cut its main interest rate by 25 basis points in September following its initial rate cut in June. China s economy saw some bright spots entering calendar year 2024 as a result of increasing travel and consumer spending due to relaxed COVID policies, but the region faces ongoing challenges from a weakened real estate market and declining exports. 
 
 The supply chain has been stabilizing since the second quarter of calendar year 2023. While some supply chain challenges and elevated costs remain, particularly for materials like copper and plastics, other costs, such as transportation, have returned to pre-COVID levels. However, the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict have periodically disrupted some shipments in the Red Sea. As a result, some ocean freight costs and transit times may temporarily increase until shipping in the region returns to normal. Generally, our mitigation efforts and ongoing lean initiatives have tempered the impact of broad market challenges. The market demand in our Motive Power segment remains healthy, but we saw a decrease in demand in the Class 8 truck market in the first half of our fiscal year, which impacted the Specialty segment. The cyclical capex pauses in the communication networks market has decreased demand in the Energy Systems segment since our second quarter fiscal 2024, but we saw some improved order rates in the second quarter fiscal 2025. 
 
 Volatility of Commodities and Foreign Currencies 
 36 

Table of Contents 

Our most significant commodity and foreign currency exposures are related to lead and the Euro, respectively. Historically, volatility of commodity costs and foreign currency exchange rates have caused large swings in our production costs. In the fiscal year 2025, we have experienced a range in lead prices from approximately 1.05 per pound to 0.90 per pound. Costs in some of our other raw materials such as steel, acid, separator paper and electronics have moderated since the middle of fiscal year 2024, but we have seen some price increases in other raw materials such as copper since the beginning of fiscal year 2025. 
 
 Customer Pricing 
 
 Our selling prices fluctuated during the last several years to offset the volatile cost of commodities. Approximately 25 of our revenue is now subject to agreements that adjust pricing to a market-based index for lead. Customer pricing changes generally lag movements in lead prices and other costs by approximately six to nine months. In fiscal 2024 and 2025, customer pricing has increased due to certain commodity prices and other costs having increased throughout the year. 
 
 Based on current commodity markets, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether commodity prices will be higher or lower in fiscal 2025 versus fiscal 2024. However, given the lag related to increasing our selling prices for inflationary cost increase, on average our selling prices should be higher in fiscal 2025 versus fiscal 2024. As we concentrate more on energy systems and non-lead chemistries, the emphasis on lead is expected to continue to decline. 
 
 Primary Operating Capital 
 
 As part of managing the performance of our business, we monitor the level of primary operating capital, and its ratio to net sales. We define primary operating capital as accounts receivable, plus inventories, minus accounts payable. The resulting net amount is divided by the trailing three-month net sales (annualized) to derive a primary operating capital percentage. We believe these three elements included in primary operating capital are most operationally driven, and this performance measure provides us with information about the asset intensity and operating efficiency of the business on a company-wide basis that management can monitor and analyze trends over time. Primary operating capital was 978.8 million (yielding a primary operating capital percentage of 27.7 at September 29, 2024, 852.9 million (yielding a primary operating capital percentage of 23.4 at March 31, 2024 and 990.2 million at October 1, 2023 (yielding a primary operating capital percentage of 27.5 ). The primary operating capital percentage of 27.7 at September 29, 2024 increased by 430 basis points compared to March 31, 2024 and increased 20 basis points compared to October 1, 2023. The increase in primary operating capital percentage at September 29, 2024 compared to March 31, 2024 was primarily due to the addition of Bren-Tronics balances as well as increases to inventory for strategic build up and decreases to accounts payable levels due to timing of payments this quarter. Accounts receivable amounts increased comparatively mainly due to longer termed collections from customers compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of the prior fiscal year. The slight increase in primary operating capital percentage at September 29, 2024 compared to October 1, 2023 was increases from Bren-Tronics offset by reduction in accounts receivable due to higher collections and inventory due to improved inventory management actions and easing of supply chain constraints compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Primary operating capital and primary operating capital percentages at September 29, 2024, March 31, 2024 and October 1, 2023 are computed as follows:

 A substantial majority of the Company s cash and investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and expected to be utilized to fund local operating activities, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions. The Company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic and foreign liquidity. 
 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into a second amendment to the Amended Credit Facility (as amended, the Second Amended Credit Facility ). As a result, the Second Amended Credit Facility, now scheduled to mature on September 30, 2026, consists of a 130.0 million senior secured term loan and a CAD 106.4 million 84.2 million) term loan (the Second Amended Term Loan and an 850.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Second Amended Revolver ). This amendment resulted in a decrease of the Amended Term Loan by 150.0 million and an increase of the Amended Revolver by 150.0 million. 
 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a third amendment to the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the Third Amended Credit Facility ). The Third Amended Credit Facility provided a new incremental delayed-draw senior secured term loan up to 300 million (the Third Amended Term Loan ), which was available to draw until March 15, 2023. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company drew 300 million in the form of the Third Amended Term Loan. The funds will mature on September 30, 2026, the same as the Company's Second Amended Term Loan and Second Amended Revolver. In connection with the agreement, the Company incurred 1.2 million in third party administrative and legal fees recognized in interest expense and capitalized 1.1 million in charges from existing lenders as a deferred asset. Additionally, the Company derecognized the capitalized deferred asset and recognized the 1.1 million as deferred financing costs. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a fourth amendment to the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the Fourth Amended Credit Facility ). The Fourth Amended Credit Facility replaces the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR in the calculation of interest for both the Second Amended Revolver and the Second Amended Term Loan. 
 
 On January 11, 2024, we issued 300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.625 Senior Notes due 2032 (the 2032 Notes ). Proceeds from this offering, net of debt issuance costs, were 297.0 million and were utilized to pay down the Fourth Amended Credit Facility. 
 
 During the six months of fiscal 2025, we purchased 780,849 shares for 75.2 million. 
 
 We believe that our strong capital structure and liquidity affords us access to capital for future acquisitions, capital investments, stock repurchase opportunities and continued dividend payments.

 Operating earnings increased 10.8 million or 12.2 and increased 12.7 million or 7.1 in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2024. Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, increased 140 basis points and 120 basis points in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2024. 
 
 The Energy Systems operating earnings, as a percentage of sales, increased 30 basis points and decreased 70 basis points in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2024. The increase for the quarter was primarily as a result of lower commodity costs as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales on lower volumes partially offset by unfavorable product mix; and the decrease for the six months was a result of continued lower volumes and unfavorable mix from lower high margin power electronics sales, partially offset by lower operating costs. 
 
 The Motive Power operating earnings, as a percentage of sales, increased 70 basis points and 80 basis points in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2024. These increases were driven by continued volume growth in addition to favorable lead costs.

The Specialty operating earnings, as a percentage of sales, increased 90 basis points and decreased 130 basis points in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2024. The increase for the quarter is a result of the accretive Bren-Tronics acquisition combined with robust Aerospace and Defense volumes, partially offset by declines in transportation OEM volume. The decrease for the six months is a result of the volume declines from the transportation OEM customers which outweighed the improvements from the Bren-Tronics acquisition.

 Interest expense of 12.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (net of interest income of 0.7 million) was 0.3 million higher than the interest expense of 12.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (net of interest income of 0.5 million). 
 
 Interest expense of 23.5 million in the six months of fiscal 2025 (net of interest income of 1.8 million) was 3.9 million lower than the interest expense of 27.4 million in the six months of fiscal 2024 (net of interest income of 1.2 million). 
 
 The increase in interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and the decrease in the six months of fiscal 2025 is primarily due to higher borrowing levels in the quarter where the six months benefited from lower average borrowing levels. Our average debt outstanding was 1,126.9 million and 1,009.2 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2025, compared to 990.3 million and 1,030.3 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Included in interest expense are non-cash charges for deferred financing fees of 0.5 million and 1.0 million for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2025 and 0.4 million and 0.8 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2024.

 The Company s income tax provision consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. The tax provision for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was based on the estimated effective tax rates applicable for the full years ending March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively, after giving effect to items specifically related to the interim periods. Our effective income tax rate with respect to any period may be volatile based on the mix of income in the tax jurisdictions, in which we operate, changes in tax laws and the amount of our consolidated earnings before taxes. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has a global minimum corporate tax of 15 for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds (referred to as Pillar 2), with certain aspects of Pillar 2 effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2023. While it is uncertain whether the U.S. will enact legislation to adopt Pillar 2, certain countries in which we operate have adopted legislation, and other countries are in the process of introducing legislation to implement Pillar 2. On August 26, 2024, the U.S. Tax Court issued a ruling in Varian. The ruling related to the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition tax of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (our fiscal 2018). The impact of the enacted legislation and ruling is included below. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate as new legislation and guidance is issued. 
 
 The consolidated effective income tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 were 2.3 and 11.2 and for the six months of fiscal 2025 and 2024 were 6.8 and 10.2 . The rate decrease in the second quarter compared to the prior year period is primarily due to a discrete tax benefit as a result of Varian , offset by the impact of Pillar 2. The rate decrease in the six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year periods are primarily due to a discrete tax benefit as a result of Varian , offset primarily by a discrete foreign exchange tax benefit related to undistributed earnings in first quarter of fiscal 2024, impact of Pillar 2, and mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. 
 
 Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 53 for fiscal 2025 compared to 56 for fiscal 2024. The foreign effective tax rates for the six months of fiscal 2025 and 2024 were 15 and 13 , respectively. The foreign effective tax rate increase in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of the prior year is primarily due to the impact of Pillar 2. Income from the Company's Swiss subsidiary comprised a substantial portion of the Company's overall foreign mix of income for both fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 and were taxed at an effective income tax rate of approximately 11 and 9 , respectively.

 Cash Flow and Financing Activities 
 
 Operating activities provided cash of 44.0 million in the six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 185.7 million of cash provided in the six months of fiscal 2024, with the decrease in operating cash resulting mainly due to activity in accounts receivable, inventory, accrued expenses and accounts payable. Inventory increased or used cash of 12.4 million, and accounts receivable increased or used cash of 9.3 million. Additionally, accounts payable decreased or used cash of 40.1 million. In the six months of fiscal 2025, net earnings were 152.4 million, depreciation and amortization 48.8 million, stock-based compensation 12.2 million, allowance for doubtful debts of 1.1 million, non-cash interest of 1.0 million and, non-cash charges relating to exit charges 0.2 million. Prepaid and other current assets were a use of funds of 26.2 million, primarily from an increase of 19.4 million in contract assets, 7.6 million in other prepaid expenses, and 1.6 million in prepaid insurance, partially offset by a decrease of 2.4 million in prepaid taxes. Accrued expenses were a use of funds of 83.9 million primarily from decrease in tax accruals of 81.8 million, interest payments net of accruals of 31.6 million, other miscellaneous accruals of 3.9 million, sales related accruals of 5.0 million, and payroll related payments of 0.5 million net of accruals, partially offset by 36.4 million in accrued interest, warranty accruals of 1.6 million, and 0.9 million in contract liabilities.

In the six months of fiscal 2024, operating activities provided cash of 185.7 million, with the increase in operating cash resulting mainly due to net earnings. Accounts receivable decreased or provided cash of 93.4 million due to lower sales in the current quarter compared to the previous quarter. Inventory decreased or provided cash of 10.5 million due to lower inventory turns as compared to the previous quarter.

 Investing activities used cash of 282.5 million in the six months of fiscal 2025, which primarily consisted of the Bren-Tronics acquisition of 205.3 million, capital expenditures of 66.5 million relating to plant improvements and 10.9 million relating to investment in equity securities. 
 
 Investing activities used cash of 42.1 million in the six months of fiscal 2024, which primarily consisted of capital expenditures of 35.9 million relating to plant improvements and 8.3 million relating to the purchase of a business partially offset by 2.0 million in proceeds from sale of disposal property, plant, and equipment. 
 
 Financing activities provided cash of 305.3 million in the six months of fiscal 2025. During the six months of fiscal 2025, we borrowed 476.6 million under the Second Amended Revolver and repaid 76.7 million of the Second Amended Revolver. Net repayments on short-term debt were 0.4 million. We purchased treasury stock totaling 75.2 million, paid cash dividends to our stockholders totaling 18.6 million, and received proceeds from stock options of 7.4 million. Payments for financing costs for debt modification were 0.4 million. We paid 8.0 million for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards. 
 
 Financing activities used cash of 153.5 million in the six months of fiscal 2024. During the six months of fiscal 2024, we borrowed 172.5 million under the Second Amended Revolver and repaid 252.5 million of the Second Amended Revolver. We repaid 12.7 million of the Second Amended Term Loan, and net repayments on short-term debt were 0.1 million. We purchased treasury stock totaling 47.3 million, paid cash dividends to our stockholders totaling 16.3 million and received proceeds from stock options of 9.7 million. 
 
 Currency translation had a positive impact of 7.8 million on our cash balance in the six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the negative impact of 9.1 million in the six months of fiscal 2024. In the six months of fiscal 2025, principal currencies in which we do business such as the Euro, Polish zloty, Swiss Franc and British pound strengthened versus the U.S. dollar. 
 
 As a result of the above, total cash and cash equivalents increased by 74.6 million to 407.9 million, in the six months of fiscal 2025 compared to a decrease of 18.9 million to 327.8 million, in the six months of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Compliance with Debt Covenants 
 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into a second amendment to the Amended Credit Facility (as amended, the Second Amended Credit Facility ). As a result, the Second Amended Credit Facility, now scheduled to mature on September 30, 2026, consists of a 130.0 million senior secured term loan (the Second Amended Term Loan ), a CAD 106.4 million 84.2 million) term loan and an 850.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Second Amended Revolver ). This amendment resulted in a decrease of the Amended Term Loan by 150.0 million and an increase of the Amended Revolver by 150.0 million.

Table of Contents 

During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a third amendment to the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the Third Amended Credit Facility ). The Third Amended Credit Facility provided a new incremental delayed-draw senior secured term loan up to 300 million (the Third Amended Term Loan ), which was available to draw until March 15, 2023. During the fourth quarter, the Company drew 300 million in the form of the Third Amended Term Loan. The funds will mature on September 30, 2026, the same as the Company's Second Amended Term Loan and Second Amended Revolver. In connection with the agreement, the Company incurred 1.2 million in third party administrative and legal fees recognized in interest expense and capitalized 1.1 million in charges from existing lenders as a deferred asset. Additionally, the Company derecognized the capitalized deferred asset and recognized the 1.1 million as deferred financing costs. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a fourth amendment to the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the Fourth Amended Credit Facility ). The Fourth Amended Credit Facility replaces the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR in the calculation of interest for both the Second Amended Revolver and the Second Amended Term Loan. 
 
 All obligations under our Fourth Amended Credit Facility are secured by, among other things, substantially all of our U.S. assets. The Fourth Amended Credit Facility contains various covenants which, absent prepayment in full of the indebtedness and other obligations, or the receipt of waivers, limit our ability to conduct certain specified business transactions, buy or sell assets out of the ordinary course of business, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends and take certain other actions. There are no prepayment penalties on loans under this credit facility. 
 
 We are in compliance with all covenants and conditions under our Fourth Amended Credit Facility and Senior Notes. We believe that we will continue to comply with the financial covenants and conditions, and that we have the financial resources and the capital available to fund the foreseeable organic growth in our business and to remain active in pursuing further acquisition opportunities. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2024 Annual Report and Note 13 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a detailed description of our debt. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
 
 A table of our obligations is contained in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations of our 2024 Annual Report. As of September 29, 2024, we had no significant changes to our contractual obligations table contained in our 2024 Annual Report. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market Risks 
 
 Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in raw material costs, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed. 
 
 Counterparty Risks 
 
 We have entered into lead forward purchase contracts, foreign exchange forward and purchased option contracts, interest rate swaps, and cross currency fixed interest rate swaps to manage the risk associated with our exposures to fluctuations resulting from changes in raw material costs, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company s agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. Those contracts that result in a liability position at September 29, 2024 are 20.2 million (pre-tax). Those contracts that result in an asset position at September 29, 2024 are 5.2 million (pre-tax). The impact on the Company due to nonperformance by the counterparties has been evaluated and not deemed material.

Table of Contents 

 We hedge our net investments in foreign operations against future volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Euro. On September 29, 2022, we terminated our cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 300 million and executed cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 150 million, maturing on December 15, 2027. Additionally, on July 2, 2024,we entered into cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 150 million, maturing on January 15, 2029. Depending on the movement in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Euro at maturity, the Company may owe the counterparties an amount that is different from the notional amount of 300 million. 
 
 Excluding our cross currency fixed interest rate swap agreements, the vast majority of these contracts will settle within one year. 
 
 Interest Rate Risks 
 
 We are exposed to changes in variable U.S. interest rates on borrowings under our credit agreements, as well as short-term borrowings in our foreign subsidiaries. On a selective basis, from time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt. At September 29, 2024 and March 31, 2024 such agreements effectively convert 200.0 million of our variable-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis, utilizing the one-month Term SOFR, as a floating rate reference. 
 
 A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased annual interest expense by approximately 4.4 million on the variable rate portions of our debt. 
 
 Commodity Cost Risks Lead Contracts 
 
 We have a significant risk in our exposure to certain raw materials. Our largest single raw material cost is for lead, for which the cost remains volatile. In order to hedge against increases in our lead cost, we have entered into forward contracts with financial institutions to fix the price of lead. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. We had the following contracts outstanding at the dates shown below: 
 
 Date s Under Contract (in millions) # Pounds Purchased (in millions) Average Cost/Pound Approximate 
 of Lead 
 Requirements (1) 
 September 29, 2024 59.4 62.5 0.95 8 March 31, 2024 50.0 53.0 0.94 8 October 1, 2023 58.2 59.0 0.99 8 
 (1) Based on the fiscal year lead requirements for the periods then ended. 
 
 For the remaining quarter of this fiscal year, we believe approximately 68 of the cost of our lead requirements is known. This takes into account the hedge contracts in place at September 29, 2024, lead purchased by September 29, 2024 that will be reflected in future costs under our FIFO accounting policy, and the benefit from our lead tolling program. 
 
 We estimate that a 10 increase in our cost of lead would have increased our cost of goods sold by approximately 35.0 million in the second quarter. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks 
 
 We manufacture and assemble our products globally in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Approximately 40 of our sales and related expenses are transacted in foreign currencies. Our sales revenue, production costs, profit margins and competitive position are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we manufacture or purchase goods relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold. Additionally, as we report our financial statements in U.S. dollars, our financial results are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar. The principal foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the Euro, Swiss franc, British pound, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. 
 
 We quantify and monitor our global foreign currency exposures. Our largest foreign currency exposure is from the purchase and conversion of U.S. dollar-based lead costs into local currencies in Europe. Additionally, we have currency exposures from intercompany financing and intercompany and third-party trade transactions. On a selective basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and purchase option contracts to reduce the impact from the volatility of currency movements; however, we cannot be certain that foreign currency fluctuations will not impact our operations in the future. 
 50 

Table of Contents 

At a point in time, we hedge approximately 5 - 10 of the nominal amount of our known annual foreign exchange transactional exposures. We primarily enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of the variation of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. 
 
 Gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged. The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items. We also selectively hedge anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure, primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with Topic 815 - Derivatives and Hedging. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we also entered into cross-currency fixed interest rate swap agreements, to hedge our net investments in foreign operations against future volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Euro. 
 
 At September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, we estimate that an unfavorable 10 movement in the exchange rates would have adversely changed our hedge valuations by approximately 48.8 million and 27.1 million, respectively. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 (b) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) and determined that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We completed the Bren-Tronics acquisition on July 26, 2024 and are in the process, but have not yet concluded our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting including this recent acquisition. Accordingly, pursuant to the SEC's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of an assessment in the year of acquisition, the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures does not include Bren-Tronics. For the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2025, Bren-Tronics accounted for less than 2 of sales and as of September 29, 2024 less than 5 of total assets.

 During the quarter ended September 29, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408(a) and (c) of Regulation S-K) except as follows: 
 
 On August 26, 2024, David M. Shaffer, President and Chief Executive Officer and member of the board of directors, entered into a trading plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act (a "10b5-1 Plan"). Mr. Shaffer s 10b5-1 Plan provides for the potential sale of up to 20,000 shares of EnerSys common stock, subject to certain conditions, the 10b5-1 Plan expires on August 22, 2025. 
 
 Item 8.01 Other Events. 
 
 On November 6, 2024, EnerSys's Board of Directors authorized a new 200 million stock repurchase program. The authorized repurchases shall be made from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing, volume and nature of share repurchases will be at the sole discretion of management, dependent on market conditions, applicable securities laws, and other factors, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. No assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased. All or part of the repurchases may be implemented under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which would allow repurchases under pre-set terms at times when EnerSys might otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed blackout periods. This repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time.
