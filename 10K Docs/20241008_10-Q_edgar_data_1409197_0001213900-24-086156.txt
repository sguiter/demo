Potential fluctuation in quarterly results; 

Rapid and significant changes in markets; and 

Insufficient revenues to cover operating costs. 

The following discussion should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto which are included in this report. 

Overview 

Through
our wholly-owned subsidiary, Bespoke Extracts Colorado, LLC, we operate a marijuana infused products manufacturing facility in Colorado. 

In
November 2021, new management of the Company was appointed and the Company began to focus on other complimentary lines of business to
its CBD offerings. Under our new management team, we plan to expand the Company s focus to regulated cannabis markets in the United
States. 

On
December 2, 2021, Bespoke Extracts Colorado, LLC, a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into an asset purchase
agreement with WonderLeaf, and on December 7, 2021, Bespoke Colorado and WonderLeaf entered into an amendment to such asset purchase agreement
(as amended, the WonderLeaf Purchase Agreement ). Pursuant to the Wonderleaf Purchase Agreement, Bespoke Colorado agreed
to purchase from WonderLeaf, and WonderLeaf agreed to sell to Bespoke Colorado, certain assets of WonderLeaf, including a license to manufacture
marijuana-infused products, existing inventory, and extraction equipment and ancillary items, all as further set forth in the WonderLeaf
Purchase Agreement, for a purchase price of 50,000, to be paid in shares of common stock of the Company. The Company issued a total of
222,223 shares of common stock 0.225 per share), the fair market value on the date of issuance.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

As of June 30, 2024, we had cash of 24,791. Net cash used in operating
activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 125,316. Our current liabilities as of June 30, 2024 were 1,573,439 and consisted
of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 1,329,393, current portion of lease liability of 64,330 and advances payable related
party of 61,872. As of June 30, 2023, we had cash of 1,947. Net cash used in operating activities
for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was 402,440. Our current liabilities as of June 30, 2023 were 758,064 and consisted of accounts
payable and accrued liabilities of 647,884, deferred revenue of 9,896, current portion of lease liability of 64,330 and notes payable
related party of 35,954. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2024 the Company borrowed an additional
 8,500 from a related party. During the six months ended June 30, 2023 the Company borrowed an additional 469,954 from a related party
and repaid 90,000 owed for an inventory earnout . 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared assuming a continuation of the Company
as a going concern. The Company had negative cash flows from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and the year ended December
31, 2023 and had a working capital deficit at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. 

We
have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. Our primary source of capital has been from the sale of equity and convertible
debt securities. Our primary use of capital has been for professional fees and selling, general and administrative costs. We have no committed
sources of capital and will need to raise additional capital to continue and expand our operations. Additional capital may not be available
on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

In
addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations, including by limiting access to our facilities, customers, management,
and professional advisors, and by causing delays and constraints in manufacturing and shipping of our products. These factors, in turn,
may negatively impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our products, and our ability to raise capital on acceptable
terms, or at all. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no significant off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management of the Company
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule
13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of
the period covered by this report. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based on this evaluation,
our management has concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective since the following
material weaknesses exist: 

Our chief executive officer also functions as our principal financial officer. As a result, our officer may not be able to identify errors and irregularities in the financial statements and reports; 

We were unable to maintain full segregation of duties within our financial operations due to our reliance on limited personnel in the finance function. While this control deficiency did not result in any audit adjustments to our financial statements, it could have resulted in a material misstatement that might have been prevented or detected by a segregation of duties; and 

Documentation of all proper accounting procedures is not yet complete. 

To the extent reasonably possible
given our limited resources, we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned weaknesses, including, but not limited to, increasing
the capacity of our qualified financial personnel to ensure that accounting policies and procedures are consistent across the organization
and that we have adequate control over financial statement disclosures. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
