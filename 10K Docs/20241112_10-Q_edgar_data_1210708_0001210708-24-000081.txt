 We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that such rights to consideration are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. A contract liability for deferred revenue is recorded when consideration is received, or is unconditionally due, from a client prior to transferring control of services to the client under the terms of a contract. Deferred revenue balances typically result from advance payments received from clients prior to transferring control of services. Other than deferred revenue, we do not have any material contract assets or liabilities as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, deferred revenue was and , respectively. 
 
 Payment terms vary by client and the services being provided to the client. We consider payment terms that exceed one year to be extended payment terms. Substantially all of the Company s contracts include payment terms of 90 days or less, and we do not extend payment terms beyond one year. 
 
 We primarily record revenue on a gross basis in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income based upon the following key factors: 
 
 We maintain the direct contractual relationship with the client and are responsible for fulfilling the service promised to the client. 
 
 We maintain control over our contractors while the services to the client are being performed, including our contractors billing rates, and are ultimately responsible for paying them. 
 
 RPO. We provide complete recruitment outsourcing, project-based outsourcing, and recruitment consulting services for clients permanent staff hires. We recognize revenue for our RPO over time in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to and have an enforceable right to payment in exchange for our services. The client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services as they are provided. The transaction prices contain both fixed fees and variable consideration. Variable consideration is constrained by candidates accepting offers of permanent employment. We recognize revenue on fixed fees as the performance obligations are satisfied and variable fees as the constraint is lifted. We do not incur incremental costs to obtain our RPO contracts. The costs to fulfill these contracts are expensed as incurred. 
 
 We recognize permanent placement revenue when employment candidates accept offers of permanent employment. We have a substantial history of estimating the financial impact of permanent placement candidates who do not remain with our clients through a guarantee period. Fees to clients are generally calculated as a percentage of the new employee s annual compensation. No fees for permanent placement services are charged to employment candidates. 
 
 Contracting. We provide clients with a range of outsourced professional contract staffing services and managed service provider services, sometimes offered on a standalone basis and sometimes offered as part of a blended total talent solution. We recognize revenue for our contracting services over time as services are performed in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to and have an enforceable right to payment in exchange for our services, which is generally calculated as hours worked multiplied by the agreed-upon hourly bill rate. The client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services as they are provided. We do not incur incremental costs to obtain our contracts for

The Company records accounts receivable when its right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditioned on satisfaction of future performance obligations. Accounts receivable, net, are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect, which is net of estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. 
 
 The Company generally establishes customer credit limits and estimates the allowance for credit losses on a country or geographic basis. Customer credit limits are based upon an initial evaluation of the customer s credit quality and we adjust that limit accordingly based upon ongoing credit assessments of the customer, including payment history and changes in credit quality. Consistent with our adoption of ASU 2016-13, effective January 1, 2023 (refer to Note 3 Accounting Pronouncements), the allowance for expected credit losses is determined based on an assessment of past collection experience as well as consideration of current and future economic conditions and changes in our customer collection trends.

 , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, which if recognized in the future, would lower the Company s effective income tax rate. 
 The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of the provision for income taxes. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had and , respectively, of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits. 
 The statute of limitations for capital gains taxes on the transfer of shares in Spain lapsed in January 2023. The FIN48 reserve for Spain capital gains taxes, interest, and penalties of approximately was released as a tax benefit in the first quarter of 2023. 
 Based on information available as of September 30, 2024, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by over the next 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of global tax examinations and controversies and potential expirations of the applicable statutes of limitations. 
 In many cases, the Company s unrecognized tax benefits are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. Tax years with net operating losses NOLs remain open until such losses expire or until the statutes of limitations for those years when the NOLs are used expire. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s open tax years, which remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities, are between 2016 and 2023 depending on the jurisdiction. 
 
 The Company believes that its unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 are appropriately reflected for all years subject to examination above. 
 
 Net Operating Losses NOLs ), Capital Losses, and Valuation Allowance 
 
 The Company recorded a valuation allowance against all of our consolidated US deferred tax assets for NOLs and Capital Losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets for NOLs until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances in the future.

The terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement, dated as of October 15, 2018 (as amended, the Rights Agreement ), by and between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent (the Rights Agent ). The Company s stockholders approved the Rights Agreement at the Company s 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 6, 2019.

 . Each fractional share of Series B Preferred Stock would give the stockholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as does share of common stock. Prior to exercise, however, a Right does not give its holder any dividend, voting or liquidation rights. 
 
 The Board entered into the Rights Agreement in an effort to preserve the value of the Company s significant U.S. NOLs and other tax benefits. The Company s ability to utilize its NOLs may be substantially limited if the Company experiences an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). In general, an ownership change would occur if the percentage of the Company s ownership by one or more 5-percent shareholders (as defined in the Code) increases by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage owned by such stockholders at any time during the prior three years. The Rights Agreement is designed to preserve the Company s tax benefits by deterring transfers of common stock that could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. In general terms, the Rights Agreement imposes a significant penalty upon any person or group that acquires beneficial ownership (as defined under the Rights Agreement) of or more of the outstanding common stock without the prior approval of the Board (an Acquiring Person ). Any Rights held by an Acquiring Person are void and may not be exercised. 
 
 The Company also has a provision in its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Charter Provision which generally prohibits transfers of its common stock that could result in an ownership change. 
 
 The Rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i) days after a public announcement by the Company that a person or group has become an Acquiring Person; and (ii) business days (or a later date determined by the Board) after a person or group begins a tender or an exchange offer that, if completed, would result in that person or group becoming an Acquiring Person. 
 
 Until the date that the Rights become exercisable (the Distribution Date ), common stock certificates will also evidence the Rights and will contain a notation to that effect. Any transfer of shares of common stock prior to the Distribution Date will constitute a transfer of the associated Rights. After the Distribution Date, the Rights will separate from the common stock and be evidenced by Right certificates, which the Company will mail to all holders of Rights that have not become void. After the Distribution Date, if a person or group already is or becomes an Acquiring Person, all holders of Rights, except the Acquiring Person, may exercise their Rights upon payment of the purchase price to purchase shares of common stock (or other securities or assets as determined by the Board) with a market value of times the purchase price (a Flip-in Event ). After the Distribution Date, if a Flip-in Event has already occurred and the Company is acquired in a merger or similar transaction, all holders of Rights, except the Acquiring Person, may exercise their Rights upon payment of the purchase price, to purchase shares of the acquiring or other appropriate entity with a market value of times the purchase price of the Rights. Rights may be exercised to purchase Series B Preferred Stock only after the Distribution Date occurs and prior to the occurrence of a Flip-in Event as described above. A Distribution Date resulting from the commencement of a tender offer or an exchange offer as described in the second bullet point above could precede the occurrence of a Flip-in Event, in which case the Rights could be exercised to purchase Series B Preferred Stock. A Distribution Date resulting from any occurrence described in the first bullet point above would necessarily follow the occurrence of a Flip-in Event, in which case the Rights could be exercised to purchase shares of common stock (or other securities or assets) as described above. 
 
 The Rights will expire on the earliest of (i) the Close of Business on October 15, 2027, or such earlier date as of which the Board determines that this Agreement is no longer necessary for the preservation of Tax Benefits, (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed as provided in Section 23, (iii) the time at which all exercisable Rights are exchanged as provided in Section 24, (iv) the Close of Business on the effective date of the repeal of Section 382 of the Code or any successor or replacement provision if the Board determines that this Agreement is no longer necessary for the preservation of Tax Benefits, and (v) the Close of Business on the first day of a taxable year of the Company to which the Board determines that no Tax Benefits may be carried forward. 
 
 The Board may redeem all (but not less than all) of the Rights for a redemption price of per Right at any time before the later of the Distribution Date and the date of the first public announcement or disclosure by the Company that a person or group has become an Acquiring Person. Once the Rights are redeemed, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate, and the only right of the holders of such Rights will be to receive the redemption price.

We continue to explore all strategic alternatives to maximize value for the Company s stockholders, including without limitation, improving the market position and profitability of our services in the marketplace, and enhancing our valuation. We may pursue our goals through organic growth, strategic initiatives, or other alternatives. Additionally, we will continue to monitor capital markets for opportunities to repurchase shares, and consider other actions designed to enhance value to our stockholders, as well as review information regarding potential acquisitions or combinations, both within the RPO business line as well as other businesses, and provide information to third parties regarding potential dispositions of assets or business lines, from time to time. 
 
 This MD A discusses the results of the Company s business for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Current Market Conditions 
 
 Our clients demands for RPO and contracting services largely depend on the market conditions and the strength of the labor markets in the countries where we operate. In the third quarter of 2024, the market conditions remained challenging due to persistent inflation, higher interest rates, and decreased demand for labor in certain markets. We anticipate that these challenging market conditions will continue into the final quarter of 2024. 
 
 Economic conditions in most of the world s major markets continued to slow down throughout 2023 and into the third quarter of 2024. Higher than expected inflation in most markets and rising interest rates have led to significant market disruption, including further wage inflation, increased operating costs, staffing challenges, reduced consumer confidence, and limited capital market accessibility that impact our business. In addition, in connection with the challenging business environment, some of our customers have reduced demand, and certain other customers have eliminated our services on a temporary or permanent basis. These conditions and expected future inflation and potential interest rate increases could have material adverse impacts on various aspects of our business in the future. 
 
 The continued economic uncertainty has also resulted in volatility in global currencies. Stronger foreign currencies in other markets compared to the U.S. dollar during a reporting period cause local currency results of the Company s foreign operations to be translated into more U.S. dollars. 
 
 The following is a summary of the Company s financial performance highlights for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This summary should be considered in the context of the additional disclosures in this MD A which further highlight Company results by segment.

 Revenue was 36.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 39.4 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 2.5 million, or 6.5 . The decrease in revenue was principally driven by declines in Australia. 
 On a constant currency basis, the Company s revenue decreased 3.2 million, or 8.1 , primarily due to declines in contracting revenue of 1.7 million, or 8.0 , and in RPO revenue of 1.5 million, or 8.1 , compared to the same period in 2023.

Index 

 EBITDA loss was 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to EBITDA of 1.2 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease in EBITDA of 1.5 million. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA decreased 1.6 million. 
 Net loss was 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 0.5 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease in net income of 1.4 million. On a constant currency basis, net income also decreased 1.4 million. 
 Summary of Financial Performance Highlights for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Revenue was 106.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 127.4 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 20.9 million, or 16.4 . The decrease in revenue was principally driven by a decline in Australia. 
 On a constant currency basis, the Company s revenue decreased 20.6 million, or 16.2 , due to a decrease in RPO revenue of 11.2 million, or 18.0 , coupled with a decrease in contracting revenue of 9.4 million, or 14.6 , compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Adjusted net revenue was 52.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 63.7 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 11.2 million, or 17.5 . 
 On a constant currency basis, adjusted net revenue decreased 11.2 million, or 17.6 , due to a decrease in RPO adjusted net revenue of 10.9 million, or 17.9 , while contracting revenue decreased by 0.4 million, or 12.1 , compared to the same period in 2023 . 
 SG A and Non-Op was 55.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 60.3 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 4.8 million, or 8.0 . 
 On a constant currency basis, SG A and Non-Op decreased 4.8 million, or 8.0 , as compared to the same period in 2023. SG A and Non-Op as a percentage of revenue was 52.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 47.5 for the same period in 2023. 
 EBITDA loss was 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to EBITDA of 3.4 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease in EBITDA of 6.4 million. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA also decreased 6.4 million. 
 Net loss was 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 1.5 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease in net income of 5.7 million. On a constant currency basis, net income also decreased 5.7 million. 
 Constant Currency (Non-GAAP Financial Measure) 
 The Company operates on a global basis, with the majority of its revenue generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the Company s results of operations. For the discussion of reportable segment results of operations, the Company uses constant currency information. Constant currency compares financial results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The Company defines the term constant currency to mean that financial data for a previously reported period is translated into U.S. dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate financial data for the current period. Constant currency metrics should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the U.S. The Company s management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currency and believes these results better represent the Company s underlying business trends. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates generally impact only reported earnings. 
 Changes in revenue, adjusted net revenue, SG A and Non-Op, operating income (loss), net income (loss), and EBITDA (loss) include the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The tables below summarize the impact of foreign currency exchange adjustments on the Company s operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Use of EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure) 
 Management believes EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of the Company s performance that provides useful information to investors regarding the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Management considers EBITDA to be the best indicator of operating performance and most comparable measure across the regions in which the Company operates. Management uses this measure to evaluate capital needs and working capital requirements. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, or net income prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as a measure of the Company s profitability. EBITDA is derived from net income adjusted for the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, interest expense (income), and depreciation and amortization.

 Corporate expenses were 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.4 million for the same period in 2023, representing an increase of 0.6 million. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expenses and staff costs, as well as lower corporate allocations. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, corporate expenses were 3.2 million compared to 2.2 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 1.1 million. The increase was primarily due to lower corporate allocations, partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses.

The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were negative 12 and positive 44 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rates differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to pretax losses for which no tax benefit can be recognized, foreign tax rate differences, and non-deductible expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effective tax rates differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to a discrete tax benefit recognized following the lapse of certain statutes of limitations related to Spain, recognition of a portion of a deferred tax asset in Canada, state income taxes, changes in valuation allowances in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions which reduces or eliminates the effective tax rate on current year profits or losses, foreign tax rate differences, taxes on repatriations or deemed repatriation of foreign profits, and non-deductible expenses.

Basic and diluted loss per share were 1.39 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of 0.48 and 0.47, respectively, for the same period in 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 16.5 million, compared to 23.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The following table summarizes the Company s cash flow activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, in millions 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (4.8) (3.0) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 1.1 (0.1) Net cash used in financing activities (3.0) (2.2) Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 0.1 (0.2) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (6.7) (5.5) 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 4.8 million, compared to 3.0 million of net cash used in operating activities for the same period in 2023, resulting in a 1.8 million increase in net cash used. The increase in net cash used was principally driven by the Company s lower net income in 2024, partially offset by more favorable working capital comparisons to the prior year. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 1.1 million compared to 0.1 million of net cash used in investing activities in 2023. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2024 reflects cash received from benefit payouts of 1.1 million. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 3.0 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 2.2 million in 2023. The increase in net cash used was attributed to repurchases of shares of common stock of 2.8 million in 2024, including cash paid for tax withholdings, compared to the previous year.

 Invoice Finance Credit Facility 
 
 On April 8, 2019, the Company s Australian subsidiary Australian Borrower entered into an invoice finance credit facility agreement (the NAB Facility Agreement with National Australia Bank Limited NAB ). The NAB Facility Agreement provides the Australian Borrower with the ability to borrow funds based on a percentage of eligible trade receivables up to a maximum of 4 million Australian dollars. No receivables have terms greater than 90 days, and any risk of loss is retained by the Australian Borrower. The interest rate is calculated as the variable receivable finance indicator rate, plus a margin of 1.60 per annum. Borrowings under this facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Australian Borrower. The NAB Facility Agreement does not have a stated maturity date and can be terminated by either the Australian Borrower or NAB upon 90 days written notice. As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the NAB Facility Agreement. Interest expense and fees incurred on the NAB Facility Agreement were 4 and 13 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 4 and 13 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Australian Borrower was in compliance with all financial covenants under the NAB Facility Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 On May 25, 2022, Hudson Global Resources (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. Singapore Borrower ), which the Company acquired on October 31, 2023 (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited HSBC ), entered into an invoice finance credit facility agreement (the HSBC Facility Agreement ). The HSBC Facility Agreement allows the Singapore Borrower to borrow funds up to a maximum of 1 million Singapore dollars, based on a percentage of eligible trade receivables. All receivables have a term of no more than 60 days, and any risk of loss is borne by the Singapore Borrower. The interest rate is calculated as the bank s external cost of capital, plus a margin of 3.5 per annum. The Company ended the HSBC Facility Agreement in May 2024. Interest expense and fees incurred on the HSBC Facility Agreement were 6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents on hand of 15.8 million. The Company also has the capability to borrow an additional 4 million Australian dollars under the NAB Facility Agreement. Other than as described above, the Company has no financial guarantees, outstanding debt or other lease agreements or arrangements that could trigger a requirement for an early payment or that could change the value of our assets. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its needs through at least the next 12 months, based on the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2024. The Company s near-term cash requirements during 2024 are primarily related to the funding of the Company s operations. For the full year 2024, the Company expects to make capital expenditures of less than 0.5 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 7.1 million of the Company s cash and cash equivalents noted above were held in the U.S. and the remainder were held outside the U.S., primarily in Australia 3.6 million), Philippines 0.9 million), Singapore 0.7 million), Belgium 0.7 million), the U.K. 0.7 million), Hong Kong 0.7 million), and India 0.5 million). The majority of the Company s offshore cash is available to it as a source of funds, net of any tax obligations or assessments. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 
 Contingencies 
 From time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to compliance audits by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign government regulatory, tax, and other authorities relating to a variety of regulations, including wage and hour laws, unemployment taxes, workers' compensation, immigration, and income, value-added, and sales taxes. The Company is also subject to, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, various claims, lawsuits, and other complaints from, for example, clients, candidates, suppliers, landlords for both leased and subleased properties, former and current employees, and regulators or tax authorities. Periodic events and management actions such as business reorganization initiatives can change the number and types of audits, claims, lawsuits, contract disputes, or complaints asserted against the Company. Such events can also change the likelihood of assertion and the behavior of third parties to reach resolution regarding such matters. 
 The economic conditions in the recent past have given rise to many news reports and bulletins from clients, tax authorities, and other parties about changes in their procedures for audits, payment, plans to challenge existing contracts, and other such matters aimed at being more aggressive in the resolution of such matters in their own favor. The Company believes 
 - 40 - 

Index 

 that it has appropriate procedures in place for identifying and communicating any matters of this type, whether asserted or likely to be asserted, and it evaluates its liabilities in light of the prevailing circumstances. Changes in the behavior of third parties could cause the Company to change its view of the likelihood of a claim and what might constitute a trend. Employment laws vary in the markets in which we operate, and in some cases, employees and former employees have extended periods during which they may bring claims against the Company. 
 For matters that reach the threshold of probable and estimable, the Company establishes reserves for legal, regulatory, and other contingent liabilities. The Company did not have any reserves as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be determined, the Company believes that none of the currently pending matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
