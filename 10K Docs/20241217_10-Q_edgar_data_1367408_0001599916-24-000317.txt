ITEM 2 
 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

Certain
statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives,
and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements. 

These
forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, 
 anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, 
 will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar
expressions. 

Forward-looking
statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results
to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies
is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not
limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and
generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements
and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. 

Company
Overview 

Sino American Oil Company is a prospective investor
in the upstream oil and gas sector. The company aims to identify high-quality, income-producing oil and gas assets with a significant
portion of proved developed producing reserves, with the intent of providing risk-adjusted returns. 

Currently, the Company s plans are speculative
and largely undefined. There is a substantial risk that any investments we may make could be unsuccessful or may not yield the anticipated
outcomes. Additionally, it is important to note that we do not have the available cash or resources to finalize any investments without
outside financing or the use of our common stock as payment. Currently, the Company does not have immediate plans for securing financing. 

Potential Opportunities 

Sino American Oil Co. is exploring potential business
opportunities and investments in sectors such as: 

Recycling and energy recovery from waste 

 Waste management 

 Catalytic technologies 

 Energy efficiency improvements 

 Innovative energy storage for renewables 

 Resource recovery from waste heaps 

 Sludge management 

 Cleaning
contaminated metal ores 

 Exploitation of low-calorific natural gas deposits

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
cash balance was 369 as of June 30, 2023, and 0 as of September 30, 2022. We have been utilizing funds from our former and present
officers and directors to fund our operations and we intend to rely on our sole officer, and/or related parties, for funding going
forward. 

Our
sole officer and director, Mr. Aleksandrov has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the
company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve-month period, we may require further funding. Being a
start-up stage company, we have very limited operating history. After a twelve-month period we may need additional financing but
currently do not have any arrangements for such financing. 

If
we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash we need, or cease operations
entirely. 

Revenues 

We
have not recorded any revenue to date. 

Net
Loss 

We
recorded a net loss of 554 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, and 47,526 for the three months ended June 30, 2022. 

We
recorded a net loss of 5,814 for the nine months ended June 30, 2023, and 309,686 for the nine months ended June 30, 2022. 

The
net loss for the above periods is primarily comprised of general and administrative expenses, and specifically for the nine months ended
June 30, 2022 we also incurred significant consulting expenses. 

Cash
flow 

For
the nine months ended June 30, 2023, we had positive cash flows from operating activities in the amount of 18,770. Comparatively,
for the nine months ended June 30, 2022, we had negative cash flows from operating activities in the amount of 74,935. The variance
is attributable to a larger net loss incurred during the nine months ended June 30, 2022. 

For
the nine months ended June 30, 2023, we had net cash flows from financing activities in the amount of (18,401). Comparatively, for the
nine months ended June 30, 2022, we had net cash flows from financing activities in the amount of 71,848. The variance is primarily
attributable to proceeds from loans payable. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has no source of revenue, has suffered recurring losses
since inception and has no assurance of future profitability. The Company will continue to require financing from external sources to
finance its operating and investing activities until sufficient positive cash flows from operations can be generated. There is no assurance
that financing or profitability will be achieved, accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these
uncertainties.

ITEM 4 
 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Management s
Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our chief executive officer Boriss Aleksandrov, who is also our chief financial officer (who is acting as our principal executive
officer, principal financial officer and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
of June 30, 2023, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our chief executive officer, who is also our chief financial
officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The sole officer concluded that
the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report due to material weaknesses
identified below. 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: Due to our small size, we did not have sufficient personnel in our accounting and financial
reporting functions. As a result, we were not able to achieve adequate segregation of duties and were not able to provide for adequate
review of the financial statements. This control deficiency, which is pervasive in nature, results in a reasonable possibility that material
misstatements of the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis; and we lacked sufficient
written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of U.S. GAAP
and SEC disclosure requirements and the identification and approval of related party transactions. 

Inherent
limitations on effectiveness of controls 

Internal
control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for
advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization,
and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject
to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented
by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process
and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined
to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have occurred for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023,
that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
