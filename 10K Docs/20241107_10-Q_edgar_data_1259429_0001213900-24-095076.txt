		 , and adjusted pro rata for any share issuances, debt issuances, repurchases or redemptions during the current calendar quarter; provided, however, that no Base Fee is payable on the cash proceeds received by the Company in connection with any share or debt issuances until such proceeds have been invested in accordance with the Company s investment objectives. 

The Base Fee payable to Oxford Square Management as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was and , respectively. 
		 Incentive Fee 
		 The incentive fees are commonly referred to as the Income Incentive Fee and the Capital Gains Incentive Fee, with the first fee payable quarterly in arrears and the second fee payable in arrears at the end of each calendar year. 
		 Net Investment Income Incentive Fee 
		 The first fee (the Net Investment Income Incentive Fee ), is determined by reference to the Company s Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined below). Given that this incentive fee is payable without regard to any gain, loss or unrealized depreciation that may occur during the quarter, Oxford Square Management s incentive fee may be payable notwithstanding a decline in net asset value that quarter. 
		 Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Net Investment Income Incentive Fee is calculated based on the Company s Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. 
		 For this purpose, Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter minus the Company s operating expenses for the quarter (including the Base Fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
		 Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to one -fourth of an annual hurdle rate. The annual hurdle rate is determined as of the immediately preceding December 31 st by adding to the interest rate then payable on the most recently issued five -year U.S. Treasury Notes, up to a maximum annual hurdle rate of . The annual hurdle rates for the

		 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2024 (Unaudited) 
		 NOTE 7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (cont.) 
		 and respectively, under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Company s net investment income (to the extent not distributed to stockholders) used to calculate the Net Investment Income Incentive Fee was also included in the amount of gross assets used to calculate the Base Fee. 
		 a. The operation of the incentive fee with respect to the Company s Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for each quarter is as follows: 
		 i. no incentive fee is payable to Oxford Square Management in any calendar quarter in which the Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed one fourth of the annual hurdle rate for the 2024 calendar year). 
		 ii. of the amount of the Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds one -fourth of the annual hurdle rate for the 2024 calendar year) in any calendar quarter is payable to Oxford Square Management (i.e., once the hurdle rate is reached, of all Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income thereafter will be allocated to Oxford Square Management). 
		 Under the terms of the 2016 Fee Waiver, for the purpose of calculating the amount of total advisory fees (if any) to be waived during a particular calendar quarter, the Income Incentive Fee (as a portion of the total calculation) is calculated based on the amount by which (x) the Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined below) for the calendar quarter exceeds (y) the Preferred Return Amount (as defined below) for the calendar quarter. 
		 a. A Preferred Return Amount is calculated on a quarterly basis by multiplying by the Company s net asset value at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. 
		 b. The Net Investment Income Incentive Fee is then calculated as follows: 
		 (a) no Net Investment Income Incentive Fee is payable to Oxford Square Management in any calendar quarter in which the Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the Preferred Return Amount 
		 (b) of the Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such quarter, if any, that exceeds the Preferred Return Amount but is less than or equal to a Catch -Up Amount determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying by OXSQ s net asset value at the end of such calendar quarter; and 
		 (c) for any quarter in which the Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the Catch -Up Amount, the Net Investment Income Incentive Fee will be of the amount of the Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such quarter. 
		 c. There is no accumulation of amounts from quarter to quarter for the Preferred Return Amount, and accordingly there is no claw back of amounts previously paid to Oxford Square Management if the Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for subsequent quarters is below the quarterly Preferred Return Amount, and there is no delay of payment of incentive fees to Oxford Square Management if the Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for prior quarters is below the quarterly Preferred Return Amount for the quarter for which the calculation is being made. 
		 d. The calculation of the Company s Net Investment Income Incentive Fee is subject to a total return requirement that provides that a Net Investment Income Incentive Fee will not be payable to Oxford Square Management except to the extent of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations (which is the amount, if positive, of the sum of the Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment

There was no Net Investment Income Incentive Fee payable to Oxford Square Management as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
		 Capital Gains Incentive Fee 
		 The Capital Gains Incentive Fee, which is calculated identically under the Investment Advisory Agreement and under the 2016 Fee Waiver, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals of the Company s Incentive Fee Capital Gains, which consists of its realized capital gains for each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation for that calendar year. For accounting purposes only, in order to reflect the theoretical Capital Gains Incentive Fee that would be payable for a given period as if all unrealized gains were realized, the Company will accrue a Capital Gains Incentive Fee based upon net realized gains and unrealized depreciation for that calendar year (in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement), plus unrealized appreciation on investments held at the end of the period. It should be noted that a fee so calculated and accrued would not necessarily be payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and may never be paid based upon the computation of Capital Gains Incentive Fees in subsequent periods. Amounts paid under the Investment Advisory Agreement will be consistent with the formula reflected in the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
		 The amount of Capital Gains Incentive Fee expense related to the hypothetical liquidation of the portfolio (and assuming no other changes in realized or unrealized gains and losses) would only become payable to Oxford Square Management in the event of a complete liquidation of the Company s portfolio as of period end and the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement on such date. Also, it should be noted that the Capital Gains Incentive Fee expense fluctuates with the Company s overall investment results. 
		 There were no Capital Gains Incentive Fees based on hypothetical liquidation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There was no liability for Capital Gains Incentive Fees based on hypothetical liquidation as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

As of December 31, 2023, there were no accrued compensation expenses payable under the Administration Agreement. 
		 Co-Investment Exemptive Relief 
		 On June 14, 2017, the SEC issued an order permitting the Company and certain of its affiliates to complete negotiated co -investment transactions in portfolio companies, subject to certain conditions (the Order ). Subject to satisfaction of certain conditions to the Order, the Company and certain of its affiliates are permitted, together with any future BDCs, registered closed -end funds and certain private funds, each of whose investment adviser is Oxford Square Management or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Oxford Square Management, to co -invest in negotiated investment opportunities where doing so would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, providing the Company s stockholders with access to a broader array of investment opportunities. 
		 Pursuant to the Order, the Company is permitted to co -invest in such investment opportunities with its affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of its independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co -investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co -investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and its stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co -investment transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company s stockholders and is consistent with the Company s then -current investment objective and strategies.

of its annual investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code. The amount to be paid out as a distribution each quarter is determined by the Board and is based upon the annual taxable income estimated by the management of the Company. Income calculated in accordance with U.S. federal income tax regulations differs substantially from GAAP income. To the extent that the Company s cumulative undistributed taxable earnings fall below the amount of distributions declared, however, a portion of the total amount of the Company s distributions for the fiscal year may be deemed a return of capital for tax purposes to the Company s stockholders. 
		 The Company intends to comply with the applicable provisions of the Code pertaining to RICs to make distributions of taxable income sufficient to relieve it of substantially all federal income taxes. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a excise tax on such income. The Company will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income, if any, as required. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred approximately for final 2023 and estimated 2024 excise tax. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred approximately for estimated 2024 excise tax, which includes a net expense accrual adjustment of approximately ), for final 2023 excise tax. Those accrual adjustments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect reversals of previously overestimated excise tax. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred approximately and , respectively, for estimated 2022 and 2023 excise tax. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a liability of approximately of estimated excise tax payable. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a liability of approximately of estimated excise tax payable. This amount is included in Accrued Expenses on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. 
		 The Company has adopted an opt out distribution reinvestment plan for its common stockholders. As a result, if the Company makes a cash distribution, then stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, unless they specifically opt out of the distribution reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company issued and shares, respectively, of common stock for approximately and , respectively, to stockholders in connection with the distribution reinvestment plan.

During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as part of the Company s dividend reinvestment plan for its common stockholders, the Company s dividend reinvestment administrator did not purchase any shares of common stock in the open market to satisfy the reinvestment portion of the Company s dividends. On each of January 31, February 29, March 29, April 30, May 31, 2024, the Company paid monthly distributions of approximately million, or per share. On June 28, July 31, August 30, 2024, the Company paid monthly distributions of approximately million, or per share. On September 30, 2024, the Company paid monthly distributions of approximately million, or per share. 
		 Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the Act ), the Company is permitted to carry forward capital losses incurred in taxable years beginning after the date of enactment for an unlimited period. However, any losses incurred during those future taxable years will be required to be utilized prior to the losses incurred in pre -enactment taxable years, which carry an expiration date. As a result of this ordering rule, pre -enactment capital loss carryforwards may be more likely to expire unused. Additionally, post -enactment capital losses that are carried forward will retain their character as either short -term or long -term losses rather than being considered all short -term as under previous law. 
		 The tax character of distributions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, represented, on an estimated basis, per share from ordinary income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates (based on an average of the reported tax character historically) and are not being provided for U.S. federal income tax reporting purposes. The timing and character of distributions for U.S. federal income tax purposes (which are determined in accordance with the U.S. federal tax rules which may differ from GAAP) may be materially different than the historical information the Company used in providing the estimates herein. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2024 will be made after year -end and the amounts represented may be materially different from the amounts disclosed in the final Form 1099 -DIV notice. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Company s investment performance and may be subject to change based on tax regulations.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
		 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
		 This Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q contains forward -looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward -looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Oxford Square Capital Corp., our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward -looking statements. The forward -looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to: 
		 our future operating results, including our ability to achieve objectives; 
		 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 
		 the impact of investments that we expect to make; 
		 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
		 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; 
		 the ability of our portfolio companies and CLO investments to achieve their objectives; 
		 the valuation of our investments in portfolio companies and CLOs, particularly those having no liquid trading market; 
		 market conditions and our ability to access alternative debt markets and additional debt and equity capital; 
		 our expected financings and investments; 
		 the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; 
		 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies and CLO investments; and 
		 the ability of our investment adviser to locate suitable investments for us and monitor and administer our investments. 
		 These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward -looking statements, including without limitation: 
		 an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies and CLO investments ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies and CLO investments; 
		 a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair our lending and investment activities; 
		 interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly because we use leverage as part of our investment strategy; 
		 the elevated levels of inflation and its impact on our investment activities and the industries in which we invest; 
		 currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars;

the impact of information technology system failures, data security breaches, data privacy compliance, network disruptions and cybersecurity attacks; and 
		 the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in Item 1A. Risk Factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10 -K for the year ended December 31, 2023, elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q and in our other filings with the SEC. 
		 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward -looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward -looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward -looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in Item 1A. Risk Factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10 -K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q . You should not place undue reliance on these forward -looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q . Because we are an investment company, the forward -looking statements and projections contained in this quarterly report are excluded from the safe harbor protections provided by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act (the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995). 
		 Except where the context requires otherwise, the terms OXSQ, Company, we, us and our refer to Oxford Square Capital Corp.; Oxford Square Management refers to Oxford Square Management, LLC; and Oxford Funds refers to Oxford Funds, LLC. 
		 The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q . 
		 OVERVIEW 
		 
		 Our investment activities are managed by Oxford Square Management, LLC Oxford Square Management ), a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Oxford Square Management is owned by Oxford Funds, LLC Oxford Funds ), its managing member, and a related party, Charles M. Royce, a member of our Board of Directors Board who holds a minority, non -controlling interest in Oxford Square Management. Jonathan H. Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer, and Saul B. Rosenthal, our President, are the controlling members of Oxford Funds. Under an investment advisory agreement (the Investment Advisory Agreement ), we have agreed to pay Oxford Square Management an annual base management fee calculated on gross assets, and an incentive fee based upon our performance. Under an amended and restated administration agreement (the Administration Agreement ), we have agreed to pay or reimburse Oxford Funds, as administrator, for certain expenses incurred in operating the Company. Our executive officers and directors, and the executive officers of Oxford Square Management and Oxford Funds, serve or may serve as officers and directors of entities that operate in a line of business similar to our own. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. 
		 We generally expect to invest between 5 million and 50 million in each of our portfolio companies, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes and market conditions warrant. We expect that our investment portfolio will be diversified among a large number of investments with few investments, if any, exceeding 5.0 of the total portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, our debt investments had stated 

47 
		 Table of Contents 

interest rates (excluding stated interest rates on those investments on non -accrual status) of between 8.71 and 13.26 and maturity dates of between 0 and 76 months. In addition, our portfolio had a weighted average annualized yield on debt investments of approximately 14.50 as of September 30, 2024. 
		 The weighted average annualized yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our fees and expenses. The weighted average annualized yield was computed using the effective interest rates as of September 30, 2024, including accretion of original issue discount OID and excluding any debt investments on non -accrual status. There can be no assurance that the weighted average annualized yield will remain at its current level. 
		 We have borrowed funds to make investments and may continue to borrow funds to make investments. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of leverage, which may be considered a speculative investment technique. Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain and loss on amounts invested and therefore increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. In addition, the costs associated with our borrowings, including any increase in the management fees payable to Oxford Square Management, will be borne by our common stockholders. 
		 In addition, as a BDC under the 1940 Act, we are required to make available significant managerial assistance, for which we may receive fees, to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. These fees would be generally non -recurring , however in some instances they may have a recurring component. We have received no fee income for managerial assistance to date. 
		 To the extent possible, we will generally seek to invest in loans that are collateralized by a security interest in the borrower s assets or guaranteed by a principal to the transaction. Interest payments, if not deferred, are normally payable quarterly with most debt investments having scheduled principal payments on a monthly or quarterly basis. When we receive a warrant to purchase stock in a portfolio company, the warrant will typically have a nominal strike price, and will entitle us to purchase a modest percentage of the borrower s stock. 
		 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, U.S. loan market performance modestly improved versus the three months ended June 30, 2024. U.S. loan prices, as defined by the Morningstar/LSTA US Leveraged Loan Index, increased from 96.54 of par as of June 30, 2024 to 96.71 of par as of September 30, 2024. 
		 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors approved the fair value of the Company s investment portfolio of approximately 262.9 million in good faith in accordance with the Company s valuation procedures. 
		 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
		 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and (iii) revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Our critical accounting estimates, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with our risk factors as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10 -K for the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on our critical accounting policies. 
		 Investment Valuation 
		 Our Board of Directors determines the fair value of our investment portfolio in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure ASC 820 and Rule 2a -5 under the 1940 Act. Estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements include the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded. We believe that there is no single definitive method for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. 

48 
		 Table of Contents 

ASC 820 -10 clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC 820 -10 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 -10 also establishes a three -tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: 
		 Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
		 Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities in markets that are not active; and 
		 Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
		 We consider the attributes of current market conditions on an on -going basis and have determined that due to the general illiquidity of the market for our investment portfolio, whereby little or no market data exists, substantially all of our fair valued investments are measured based upon Level 3 inputs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
		 Our Board of Directors determines the value of our investment portfolio each quarter. In connection with that determination, members of Oxford Square Management s portfolio management team prepare a quarterly analysis of each portfolio investment using the most recent portfolio company financial statements, forecasts and other relevant financial and operational information. We may also engage a third -party valuation firm to provide assistance in valuing certain of our syndicated loans and bilateral investments, including related equity investments, although our Board of Directors ultimately determines the appropriate valuation of each such investment. Changes in fair value, as described above, are recorded in the statements of operations as net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation. 
		 Our corporate loan portfolio investments are valued using several valuation processes. The quantitative inputs and data points that determine which method to utilize to value any given investment include, but are not limited to: 
		 Bid/offer prices; 
		 Depth, which is defined as the number of securities firms that make a market in a respective corporate syndicated loan and contribute data on the corporate syndicated loan to market data providers; 
		 Liquidity score, which is a metric to help market participants ascertain their ability to exit a position within a given time frame and near a prevailing indicative price, which provides a benchmark of liquidity risk; 
		 Financial performance of the underlying portfolio company; 
		 Recent business developments; 
		 Covenant compliance; and 
		 Recent transactions. 
		 In instances where secondary market data is limited, we may engage a third -party valuation firm to independently determine an estimate of fair value. Currently, we have a single company valued via a third -party valuation firm. This valuation method employs a waterfall method whereby the enterprise value EV of the company is estimated based on company financial performance inputs, such as EBITDA, and publicly traded comparable company multiples. The EV is then attributed to each debt tranche, preferred equity tranche, and common equity, in order of seniority, to arrive at a valuation for our holdings. Generally speaking, as estimated EV increases, the fair value of our investments will also increase. As market multiples and EBITDA increase, estimated EV will also increase. 
		 In valuing our CLO debt and equity investments, we consider the indicative prices provided by a recognized industry pricing service as a primary source, and the implied yield of such prices, supplemented by actual trades executed in the market at or around period -end , as well as the indicative prices provided by brokers who arrange transactions in such investment vehicles. We also consider those instances in which the record date for an equity distribution payment falls on the last day of the period, and the likelihood that a prospective purchaser would require 

49 
		 Table of Contents 

a downward adjustment to the indicative price representing substantially all of the pending distribution. Additional factors include any available information on other relevant transactions including firm bids and offers in the market and information resulting from bids -wanted-in-competition . In addition, we consider the operating metrics of the specific investment vehicle, including compliance with collateralization tests, defaulted and restructured securities, and payment defaults, if any. We calculate the fair value of certain CLO equity investments based upon the net present value of expected contractual payment streams discounted using estimated market yields for the equity tranche of the respective CLO vehicle. Oxford Square Management or its Valuation Committee may request an additional analysis by a third -party firm to assist in the valuation process of CLO investment vehicles. All information is presented to our Board for its determination of fair value of these investments.

		 See Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the impact on our financial statements. 
		 PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY 
		 The total fair value of our investment portfolio was approximately 262.9 million and 266.9 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the value of investments during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, was due primarily to net realized losses of approximately 51.4 million, debt repayments of approximately 61.6 million, and sales of securities of approximately 4.8 million, partially offset by purchases of approximately 88.7 million and net unrealized appreciation on our investment portfolio of approximately 33.6 million (which incorporates reductions to CLO equity cost value of approximately 9.7 million). 
		 A reconciliation of the investment portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023 follows:

The decrease in total investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a decrease in interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
		 The total principal value of income producing debt investments as of September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 was approximately 209.6 million and 260.2 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, our debt investments had a range of stated interest rates (excluding stated interest rates on those investments on non -accrual status) of 8.71 and 13.26 and maturity dates of between 0 and 76 months compared to a range of stated interest rates of 9.18 to 17.00 and maturity dates between 0 and 77 months as of September 30, 2023. In addition, our total debt portfolio had a weighted average yield on debt investments of approximately 14.50 as of September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 13.10 as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, three debt investments in one portfolio company were on non -accrual status with a combined fair value of approximately 0.5 million and total principal amount of approximately 31.6 million. As of September 30, 2023, three debt investments in one portfolio company were on non -accrual status with a combined fair value of approximately 0.5 million and total principal amount of approximately 30.3 million. 
		 Income from securitization vehicles for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30 2023, was approximately 3.5 million and 4.1 million, respectively. Income from securitization vehicles for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was approximately 11.3 million and 12.8 million, respectively. The total principal outstanding on our investments in CLOs as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was approximately 354.4 million and 312.3 million, respectively. The weighted average yield on CLO equity investments as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was approximately 9.6 and 9.7 , respectively. 
		 Operating Expenses 
		 Total expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were approximately 4.2 million and 6.6 million, respectively. Total expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were approximately 12.0 million and 19.9 million, respectively. These amounts consisted of base management fees, interest expense, professional fees, compensation expense, general and administrative expenses, net investment income incentive fees, and excise tax. That decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower net investment income incentive fees and interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in base management fees. 
		 Expenses before incentive fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 4.2 million and 12.0 million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, expenses before incentive fees were approximately 5.4 million and 16.2 million respectively. 
		 The base management fee for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 1.1 million compared with 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The base management fee for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 3.1 million compared with 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Those decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were due largely to decreases in weighted average gross assets.

There were no net investment income incentive fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to the total return requirement. The net investment income incentive fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were approximately 1.2 million and 3.7 million respectively. 
		 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 2.0 million, which primarily relates to our 5.50 unsecured notes due 2028 (the 5.50 Unsecured Notes and 6.25 unsecured notes due 2026 (the 6.25 Unsecured Notes ). Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was approximately 2.5 million, which primarily relates to our 5.50 Unsecured Notes, 6.25 Unsecured Notes, and 6.50 unsecured notes due 2024. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 5.9 million, which primarily relates to our 5.50 Unsecured Notes and 6.25 Unsecured Notes. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was approximately 8.7 million, which primarily relates to our 5.50 Unsecured Notes, 6.25 Unsecured Notes, and 6.50 unsecured notes due 2024. The decreases in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to the full repayment of the 6.50 unsecured notes due 2024 throughout the year ended December 31, 2023. 
		 Professional fees, consisting of legal, consulting, valuation, audit and tax fees, were approximately 359,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 479,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Professional fees were approximately 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
		 Compensation expense was approximately 209,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 205,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Compensation expense was approximately 591,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 662,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Compensation expense reflects the allocation of compensation expenses for the services of our Chief Financial Officer, accounting personnel, and other administrative support staff. 
		 General and administrative expenses, consisting primarily of directors fees, insurance, listing fees, transfer agent and custodian fees, office supplies, facilities costs, and other expenses, were approximately 395,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 458,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses were approximately 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Office supplies, facilities costs and other expenses are allocated to us under the terms of the Administration Agreement. 
		 Excise tax was approximately 144,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 574,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excise tax was approximately 96,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 874,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
		 Incentive Fees 
		 There was no net investment income incentive fee Net Investment Income Incentive Fee recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Net Investment Income Incentive Fee recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 1.2 million and 3.7 million, respectively. The Net Investment Income Incentive Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the amount by which (x) the Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds (y) the Preferred Return Amount for the calendar quarter. For this purpose, Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income accrued during the calendar quarter minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the Base Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement with Oxford Funds, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Refer to Note 7. Related Party Transactions in the notes to our financial statements. 
		 The expense attributable to the capital gains incentive fee (the Capital Gains Incentive Fee ), as reported under GAAP, is calculated as if the Company s entire portfolio had been liquidated at period end, and therefore is calculated on the basis of net realized and unrealized gains and losses at the end of each period. That expense (or the reversal of such an expense) related to that hypothetical liquidation of the portfolio (and assuming no other changes in realized or unrealized gains and losses) would only become payable to our investment adviser

in the event of a complete liquidation of our portfolio as of period end and the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement on such date. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no accrual was required as a result of the impact of accumulated net unrealized depreciation and net realized losses on our portfolio. 
		 The amount of the Capital Gains Incentive Fee which will actually be payable is determined in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and is calculated as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement). The terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement state that the Capital Gains Incentive Fee calculation is based on net realized gains, if any, offset by gross unrealized depreciation for the calendar year. No effect is given to gross unrealized appreciation in this calculation. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, such an accrual was not required under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
		 Realized and Unrealized Gains/Losses on Investments 
		 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net realized losses on investments of approximately 12.9 million, which reflects the extinguishment upon a recapitalization of two senior secured loans in a single portfolio company. 
		 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net change in unrealized appreciation was approximately 5.8 million, composed of 6.2 million in gross unrealized appreciation, 12.2 million in gross unrealized depreciation and approximately 11.8 million relating to the reversal of prior period net unrealized depreciation as investment gains and losses were realized. This includes net unrealized appreciation of approximately 2.5 million resulting from reductions to the cost value of our CLO equity investments representing the difference between distributions received, or entitled to be received, on our investments held in CLO equity subordinated notes and fee notes, of approximately 6.0 million and the effective yield interest income recognized on our CLO equity subordinated notes and the amortized cost adjusted income on our CLO equity fee notes of approximately 3.5 million. The most significant components of the net change in unrealized appreciation during the three months ended September 30, 2024, were as follows (in millions):

Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Net Investment Income 
		 Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was approximately 6.2 million and 6.4 million, respectively. Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was approximately 20.4 million and 19.6 million, respectively. The decrease in net investment income for each of the three and nine month respective periods ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower interest income and income from securitization vehicles and investments, partially offset by a decrease in net investment income incentive fees and interest expense and an increase in other income. 
		 For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net increase in net assets resulting from net investment income per common share was 0.10 and 0.33 (basic and diluted), compared to the net increase in net assets resulting from net investment income per share of 0.11 and 0.37 (basic and diluted) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
		 Net Decrease/Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 
		 Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 0.9 million compared with a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately 6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
		 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 2.6 million compared with a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately 24.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
		 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net decrease in net assets resulting from operations per common share was 0.01 (basic and diluted), compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations per share of 0.12 (basic and diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations per common share was 0.04 (basic and diluted), compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations per share of 0.47 (basic and diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
		 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
		 As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were approximately 43.2 million as compared to approximately 5.7 million as of December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities for the period, consisting primarily of the items described in Results of Operations, was approximately 31.9 million, largely reflecting net realized losses from investments of approximately 51.4 million, proceeds from principal repayments and sales of investments of approximately 62.4 million, partially offset by purchases of investments of approximately 60.4 million and net change in unrealized appreciation of approximately 33.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 5.5 million, reflecting the payment of distributions of approximately 18.7 million, partially offset by the net proceeds of the issuance of common stock in connection with our at -the-market ATM program of approximately 24.3 million.

		 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
		 In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of undertakings containing a variety of warranties and indemnifications that may expose us to some risk of loss. The risk of future loss arising from such undertakings, while not quantifiable, is expected to be remote. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any commitments to purchase additional investments. 
		 Share Issuance and Repurchase Programs 
		 On August 22, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to that certain Equity Distribution Agreement dated August 1, 2019 with Ladenburg Thalmann Co. through which we may offer for sale, from time to time, up to 150.0 million of our common stock through an At -the-Market ATM offering. On August 16, 2024, we entered into an amended and restated equity distribution agreement, dated August 16, 2024 (the Amended and Restated Equity Distribution Agreement with Lucid Capital Markets, LLC and Ladenburg Thalmann Co. Inc., as the sales agents, to add Lucid Capital Markets, LLC as an additional sales agent to the Amended and Restated Equity Distribution Agreement. We issued a total of 5,069,789 and 8,326,819 shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM offering during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The total amount of capital raised net of underwriting fees and offering costs was approximately 14.5 million and 24.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
		 From time to time, the Board may authorize a share repurchase program under which shares are purchased in open market transactions. Since we are incorporated in Maryland, MGCL requires share repurchases to be accounted for as a share retirement. The cost of repurchased shares is charged against capital on the settlement date. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we were not authorized to repurchase any shares of outstanding common stock. 
		 Borrowings 
		 In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, as of September 30, 2024, we were only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, was at least 150 , immediately after such borrowing. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was approximately 226 and 219 , respectively. 
		 The weighted average stated interest rate and weighted average maturity on all of the Company s debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, were 5.77 and 3.0 years, respectively, and as of December 31, 2023, were 5.77 and 3.8 years, respectively. 
		 On April 3, 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of approximately 44.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6.25 Unsecured Notes. The 6.25 Unsecured Notes will mature on April 30, 2026, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after April 30, 2022. The 6.25 Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.25 per year payable quarterly on January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31 of each year. The 6.25 Unsecured Notes are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol OXSQZ.

On May 20, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering of approximately 80.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.50 Unsecured Notes.

		 Refer to Note 6. Borrowings in the notes to our financial statements. 
		 Distributions 
		 In order to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, and to avoid corporate level tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders, we are required, under Subchapter M of the Code, to distribute at least 90 of our ordinary income and short -term capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis. 
		 To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our taxable ordinary income or capital gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is taxable ordinary income or capital gains. The final determination of the nature of our distributions can only be made upon the filing of our tax return. We have until October 15, 2025, to file our federal income tax return for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
		 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of favorable regulated investment company tax treatment. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions.

		 As a result, certain conflicts of interest may arise with respect to the management of our portfolio by Messrs. Cohen and Rosenthal on the one hand, and the obligations of Messrs. Cohen and Rosenthal to manage Oxford Lane Capital Corp., Oxford Park Income Fund, Inc., Oxford Bridge II, LLC and the Oxford Gate Funds, respectively, on the other hand. 
		 Oxford Square Management, Oxford Lane Management, LLC, Oxford Park Management, LLC and Oxford Gate Management, LLC are subject to a written policy with respect to the allocation of investment opportunities among the Company, Oxford Lane Capital Corp., Oxford Park Income Fund, Inc., Oxford Bridge II, LLC and the Oxford Gate Funds. Where investments are suitable for more than one entity, the allocation policy generally provides that, depending on size and subject to current and anticipated cash availability, the absolute size of the investment as well as its relative size compared to the total assets of each entity, current and anticipated weighted average costs of capital, among other factors, an investment amount will be determined by the adviser to each entity. If the investment opportunity is sufficient for each entity to receive its investment amount, then each entity receives the investment amount; otherwise, the investment amount is reduced pro rata. On June 14, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order permitting the Company and certain of its affiliates to complete negotiated co -investment transactions in portfolio companies, subject to certain conditions (the Order ). Subject to satisfaction of certain conditions to the Order, the Company and certain of its affiliates are now permitted, together with any future BDCs, registered closed -end funds and certain private funds, each of whose investment adviser is the Company s investment adviser or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company s investment adviser, to co -invest in negotiated investment opportunities where doing so would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, providing the Company s stockholders with access to a broader array of investment opportunities. Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co -invest in such investment opportunities with our affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co -investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co -investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co -investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then -current investment objective and strategies.

		 Table of Contents 

In the ordinary course of business, we may enter into transactions with portfolio companies that may be considered related party transactions. In order to ensure that we do not engage in any prohibited transactions with any persons affiliated with us, we have implemented certain policies and procedures whereby our executive officers screen each of our transactions for any possible affiliations between the proposed portfolio investment, us, companies controlled by us and our employees and directors. We will not enter into any agreements unless and until we are satisfied that doing so will not raise concerns under the 1940 Act or, if such concerns exist, we have taken appropriate actions to seek board review and approval or exemptive relief for such transaction. Our Board reviews these procedures on an annual basis. 
		 We have also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which applies to our senior officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as all of our officers, directors and employees. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires that all employees and directors avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between an individual s personal interests and our interests. Pursuant to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, each employee and director must disclose any conflicts of interest, or actions or relationships that might give rise to a conflict. Our Audit Committee is charged with approving any waivers under our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. As required by the NASDAQ Global Select Market corporate governance listing standards, the Audit Committee of our Board is also required to review and approve any transactions with related parties (as such term is defined in Item 404 of Regulation S -K ).

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
		 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, all but three of our variable rate investments were income producing. The variable rates are generally based upon the five -year U.S. Department of Treasury note, the Prime rate, or SOFR, and, in the case of our bilateral investments, are generally reset annually, whereas our non -bilateral investments generally reset quarterly. We expect that future debt investments will generally be made at variable rates. Many of the variable rate investments contain interest rate floors. 
		 Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, including relative changes in different interest rates, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re -pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest -bearing debt and liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire leveraged loans, high yield bonds and other debt investments and the value of our investment portfolio. 
		 We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates. 
		 Based on our Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net investment income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates for our settled investments (considering interest rate floors for floating rate instruments), excluding CLO equity investments. The base interest rate case assumes the rates on our portfolio investments remain unchanged from the actual effective interest rates as of September 30, 2024. These hypothetical calculations are based on a model of the investments in our portfolio, held as of September 30, 2024, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates. Although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity, it does not adjust for changes in the credit quality, size and composition of our portfolio, and other business developments, including a change in the level of our borrowings, that could affect the net increase (or decrease) in net assets resulting from operations. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
		 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
		 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a -15 (e) and 15d -15 (e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,

as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost -benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
		 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
		 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a -15 (f) and 15d -15 (f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
		 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
		 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings, if any, cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 
		 Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities 
		 While we did not engage in unregistered sales of equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 93,639 shares of common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan. This issuance was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The aggregate value for the shares of common stock issued under the distribution reinvestment plan during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 261,000. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES. 
		 None. 
		 ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. 
		 Not applicable. 
		 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION. 
		 During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Exchange Act Rule 10b5 -1 (c) or any non -Rule 10b5 -1 trading arrangement.
