 AGREE REALTY CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2024 (Unaudited) common equity interest as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There is a one-for-one relationship between the limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership Operating Partnership Common Units owned by the Company and shares of Company common stock outstanding.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the non-controlling interest in the Operating Partnership consisted of a common ownership interest in the Operating Partnership held by the Company s founder and Executive Chairman. The Operating Partnership Common Units may, under certain circumstances, be exchanged for shares of common stock on a -for-one basis. The Company, as sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, has the option to settle exchanged Operating Partnership Common Units held by others for cash based on the current trading price of its shares. Assuming the exchange of all non-controlling Operating Partnership Common Units, there would have been shares of common stock outstanding at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned properties, with a total gross leasable area GLA of approximately million square feet. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s portfolio was approximately leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding extension options) of approximately years.

Major replacements and betterments, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. In-place lease intangible assets and the capitalized above- and below-market lease intangibles are amortized over the non-cancelable term of the lease as well as any option periods included in the estimated fair value. In-place lease intangible assets are amortized to amortization expense and above- and below-market lease intangibles are amortized as a net adjustment to rental income.

Cash held in escrow Total of cash and cash equivalents and cash held in escrow million and million, respectively. To the extent any of the tenants under these leases become unable to pay their contractual cash rents, the Company may be required to write down the straight-line rent receivable from those tenants, which would reduce rental income. The Company reviews the collectability of charges under its tenant operating leases on a regular basis, taking into consideration changes in factors such as the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area where the property is located. In the event that collectability with respect to any tenant changes, the Company recognizes an adjustment to rental revenue. The Company s review of collectability of charges under its operating leases also includes any accrued rental revenue related to the straight-line method of reporting rental revenue. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had leases across tenants where collection is not considered probable. For these tenants, the Company is recording rental income on a cash basis and has written off any outstanding receivables, including straight-line rent receivables. Adjustments to rental revenue related to tenants accounted for on the cash basis resulted in a reduction to rental income of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition to the tenant-specific collectability assessment performed, the Company may also recognize a general allowance, as a reduction to rental revenue, for its operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the potential for settlement of arrears. The Company had general allowance at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company s leases provide for reimbursement from tenants for common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. A portion of the Company s operating cost reimbursement revenue is estimated each period

As a result, all rentals and reimbursements pursuant to tenant leases are reflected as one-line, rental income, in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ). ASU 2023-09 requires annual disclosure of specific categories in the income tax rate reconciliation and provides additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold within the rate reconciliation. In addition, the amendments require annual disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions as well as individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis, however early adoption and retrospective adoption is permitted. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance and potential additional disclosures required. In March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC adopted climate-related reporting rules, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors (the SEC Climate Reporting Rules ). The SEC Climate Reporting Rules require disclosure of: Governance, strategy and risk management related to climate-related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company s business. Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Scope 1 GHG emissions are direct GHG emissions from operations owned or controlled by the entity and scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat or cooling that is consumed by operations owned or controlled by the entity. Expenditures and capitalized costs, excluding recoveries, incurred related to severe weather events and natural conditions, if such expenditures exceed defined disclosure thresholds. The SEC issued an order staying the SEC Climate Reporting Rules in April 2024. Prior to the stay, the required disclosures were to be phased-in for annual periods beginning in 2025 and 2026 annual filings. The Company continues to monitor the status of the SEC Climate Reporting Rules and is evaluating the additional disclosures required.

The Company attempts to maximize the amount it expects to derive from the underlying real estate property following the end of the lease, to the extent it is not extended. The Company maintains a proactive leasing program that, combined with the quality and locations of its properties, has made its properties attractive to tenants. The Company intends to continue to hold its properties for long-term investment and, accordingly, places a strong emphasis on the quality of construction and an on-going program of regular and preventative maintenance. The Company has elected the in ASC 842 on not separating non-lease components from associated lease components. The lease and non-lease components combined as a result of this election largely include tenant rentals and maintenance charges, respectively.

The Company s land leases do not include any variable lease payments. These leases typically provide multi-year renewal options to extend their term as lessee at the Company s option. Option periods are included in the calculation of the lease obligation liability only when options are reasonably certain to be exercised. Certain of the Company s land leases qualify as finance leases as a result of purchase options that are reasonably certain of being exercised or automatic transfer of title to the Company at the end of the lease term. Amortization of right of use assets for operating land leases is classified as land lease expense and was million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Derivative liabilities - interest rate swaps December 31, 2023 Derivative assets - interest rate swaps Derivative liabilities - interest rate swaps Other Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, cash held in escrow, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. The Company estimated the fair value of its debt based on its incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements with the same remaining maturity and on the discounted estimated future cash payments to be made for other debt. The discount rate used to calculate the fair value of debt approximates current lending rates for loans and assumes the debt is outstanding through maturity. Since such amounts are estimates that are based on limited available market information for similar transactions, there can be no assurance that the disclosed value of any financial instrument could be realized by immediate settlement of the instrument. The Company determined that the valuation of its Unsecured Term Loan, Senior Unsecured Notes and Revolving Credit Facility are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and its fixed rate mortgages are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Senior Unsecured Notes had carrying values of billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and had fair values of billion and billion, respectively. The Mortgage Notes Payable had carrying values of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and had fair values of million and million, respectively.

For performance units granted prior to 2023, vesting of the performance units following their issuance will occur ratably over a period, with the initial vesting occurring immediately following the conclusion of the performance period such that all units vest within of the original award date. Performance units granted in 2023 and 2024 vest following the conclusion of the performance period such that all units will vest from the original award date. The grant date fair value of these awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model. For the performance units granted prior to 2023, compensation expense is amortized on an attribution method over a period. For performance units granted in 2023 and 2024, compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period. Compensation expense related to performance units is determined at the grant date and is not adjusted throughout the measurement or vesting periods. The Monte Carlo simulation pricing model for issued grants utilizes the following assumptions: (i) expected term (equal to the remaining performance measurement period at the grant date); (ii) volatility (based on historical volatility); and (iii) risk-free rate (interpolated based on 2- and 3-year rates). The Company used for the forfeiture rate for determining the fair value of performance units.

 Overview The Company is a fully integrated REIT primarily focused on the ownership, acquisition, development and management of retail properties net leased to industry leading tenants. The Company was founded in 1971 by its current Executive Chairman, Richard Agree, and its common stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE in 1994. The Company s assets are held by, and all of its operations are conducted through, directly or indirectly, the Operating Partnership, of which the Company is the sole general partner and in which it held a 99.7 common interest as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 1 - Organization in the Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for further information on the ownership structure. Under the agreement of limited partnership of the Operating Partnership, the Company, as the sole general partner, has exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the Operating Partnership. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s portfolio consisted of 2,271 properties located in 49 states and totaling approximately 47.2 million square feet of GLA. The portfolio was approximately 99.6 leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 7.9 years. A significant majority of the Company s properties are leased to national tenants and approximately 67.5 of our annualized base rent was derived from tenants, or parent entities thereof, with an investment grade credit rating from S P Global Ratings, Moody s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Substantially all of our tenants are subject to net lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 1994. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and we intend to continue operating in such a manner. Results of Operations Overall The Company s real estate investment portfolio grew from approximately 6.61 billion in net investment amount representing 2,084 properties with 43.2 million square feet of GLA as of September 30, 2023 to approximately 7.13 billion in net investment amount representing 2,271 properties with 47.2 million square feet of GLA at September 30, 2024. The Company s real estate investments were made throughout and between the periods presented and were not all outstanding for the entire period; accordingly, a portion of the increase in rental income between periods is related to recognizing revenue in 2024 on acquisitions that were made during 2023. Similarly, the full rental income impact of acquisitions made during 2024 to date will not be seen until the remainder of 2024. Acquisitions During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company acquired 66 retail net lease assets for approximately 216.0 million, which includes acquisition and closing costs. These properties are located in 24 states and are leased to tenants operating in 17 diverse retail sectors for a weighted average lease term of approximately 9.8 years.

 Financing - Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by 572.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to: A 514.9 million decrease of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock; A 21.8 million increase in total dividends and distributions paid. The Company s annualized common stock dividend declared during the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 3.000 per common share, represents a 2.9 increase over the annualized dividend amount of 2.916 per common share declared in the same period in 2023; A 127.0 million increase of net repayments on the Revolving Credit Facility.

Table of Contents 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires the Company s management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. Management bases estimates on the best information available at the time, its experience, and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. If management s judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting principles would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. From time to time, the Company may re-evaluate its estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of the Company s critical accounting policies is included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 . The Company has not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Funds from Operations FFO or Nareit FFO FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. Nareit to mean net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate assets and/or changes in control, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and any impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of the Company s operating performance, or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. Further, while the Company adheres to the Nareit definition of FFO, its presentation of FFO is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs due to the fact that all REITs may not use the same definition. Core Funds from Operations Core FFO The Company defines Core FFO as Nareit FFO with the addback of (i) noncash amortization of acquisition purchase price related to above- and below- market lease intangibles and discount on assumed mortgage debt and (ii) certain infrequently occurring items that reduce or increase net income in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that its measure of Core FFO facilitates useful comparison of performance to its peers who predominantly transact in sale-leaseback transactions and are thereby not required by GAAP to allocate purchase price to lease intangibles. Unlike many of its peers, the Company has acquired the substantial majority of its net-leased properties through acquisitions of properties from third parties or in connection with the acquisitions of ground leases from third parties. Core FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of the Company s operating performance, or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. Further, the Company s presentation of Core FFO is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs due to the fact that all REITs may not use the same definition. Adjusted Funds from Operations AFFO AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry. AFFO further adjusts FFO and Core FFO for certain non-cash items that reduce or increase net income computed in accordance with GAAP. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental measure of the Company s performance; however, AFFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of its performance, or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. The Company s computation of AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating AFFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore may not be comparable to such other REITs.

 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowing activities. There is inherent roll-over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates. The extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and future financing requirements. The Company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal payments presented in thousands) and the weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt, by year of expected maturity, to evaluate the expected cash flow and sensitivity to interest rate changes. Interest rates shown reflect the impact of the swap agreements employed to fix interest rates. 

2024 (remaining) 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Mortgage Notes Payable 246 1,026 629 42,250 44,151 Average Interest Rate 6.27 6.27 6.27 3.63 Revolving Credit Facility (1) 49,000 49,000 Average Interest Rate 6.11 Unsecured Term Loan 350,000 350,000 Average Interest Rate (2) 4.52 Senior Unsecured Notes 50,000 50,000 410,000 1,750,000 2,260,000 Average Interest Rate 4.16 4.26 2.45 4.06 (1) The Revolving Credit Facility matures in August 2028 with options to extend the maturity date by six months up to two times, for a maximum maturity of August 2029. (2) The interest rate of the Unsecured Term Loan reflects the credit spread of 85 basis points, plus a 10 basis point SOFR adjustment and the impact of the interest rate swaps which convert 350.0 million of SOFR based interest to a fixed interest rate of 3.57 . 
 The table above incorporates those exposures that exist as of September 30, 2024; it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date. As a result, the Company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates. The Company seeks to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring its variable rate debt and converting such debt to fixed rates when the Company deems such conversion advantageous. From time to time, the Company may enter into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging contracts. While these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates, they also expose the Company to the risks that the other parties to the agreements will not perform. The Company could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, the agreements may be unenforceable or the underlying transactions fail to qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges under GAAP guidance. In June 2023, the Company entered into 350.0 million of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge against variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in SOFR. The swaps exchange variable SOFR rate interest on 350.0 million of SOFR indexed debt to a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.57 beginning August 1, 2023 through the maturity date of January 1, 2029. The swaps are designated to hedge the variable rate interest payments of the 2029 Unsecured Term Loan indexed to SOFR. As of September 30, 2024, these interest rate swaps were valued as a liability of approximately 4.8 million. In December 2023, the Company entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge against variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates from the trade date through the forecasted issuance date of 150.0 million of long-term debt. The Company hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for a forecasted 

 45 

Table of Contents 
 issuance of long-term debt over a maximum period ending December 2025. In May 2024, the Company entered into a 150.0 million US Treasury lock which fixed the US Treasury rate on 150.0 million notional amount at 4.51 to hedge against variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates. Upon completion of the underwritten public offering of the 2034 Senior Unsecured Public Notes in May 2024, the Company terminated the 150.0 million forward-starting interest rate swap agreements as well as the 150.0 million US Treasury lock, receiving 4.4 million, net upon termination. This settlement was included as a component of accumulated OCI, to be recognized as an adjustment to income over the term of the debt. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge against variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates from the trade date through the forecasted issuance date of 200 million of long-term debt. The Company hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for a forecasted issuance of long-term debt over a maximum period ending December 2025. As of September 30, 2024, these interest rate swaps are valued as a net liability of approximately 0.1 million. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and the Company did not have any other derivative instruments or hedging activities as of September 30, 2024. The fair value of the mortgage notes payable and senior unsecured notes is estimated to be 41.7 million and 2.14 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. The fair value of the Revolving Credit Facility and Unsecured Term Loan approximate their carrying values as they are variable rate debt. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act).

If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

(ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Effective Federal Funds Rate. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be prima facie evidence of the amount due. 
 (b) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent . If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Loans set forth in Article V are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
 (c) Obligations of Lenders Several . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 11.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under Section 11.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under Section 11.04(c) . 

(d) Funding Source . Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
 2.14 Sharing of Payments by Lenders . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff 

or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it resulting in such Lender s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them; provided that: 
 (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
 (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).
 Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation. 2.15 [Intentionally Omitted]. 2.16 Additional Loans. 
 (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time during the period beginning on the Closing Date to the Maturity Date to request additional Loans by providing written notice to the Administrative Agent (an Increase Request provided , however , that after giving effect to any such increases, the aggregate amount of the Loans shall not exceed 500,000,000 (as reduced by any payments of the principal amount of the Facility). Each such Increase Request must be an aggregate minimum amount of 5,000,000 and integral multiples of 5,000,000 in excess thereof. The Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower, shall manage all aspects of the syndication of such increase in the Loans, including decisions as to the selection of the existing Lenders and/or other banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders to be approached with respect to such increase, and the allocations of the increase, among such existing Lenders and/or other banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders. Promptly after delivery of the Increase Request to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall enter into an engagement letter with the Administrative Agent governing, among other things, the syndication of such increase, and which shall include, among other things, the fees of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent with respect to such Increase Request. Any additional Loans made pursuant to this Section shall be regarded as Loans hereunder and accordingly shall have the same maturity date as, bear interest at the same rates as, and otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions of the Loans outstanding hereunder at the time such additional Loans are made. No Lender shall be obligated in any way whatsoever to increase the principal amount of its Loans or provide a new Loan, as applicable, and any new Lender becoming a party to this Agreement in connection with any such requested increase must be an Eligible Assignee.

(b) Effecting the increase of the Loans under this Section is subject to the following conditions precedent: (x) no Default shall be in existence on the effective date of such increase or would result from such proposed increase or from the application of the proceeds thereof, (y) the representations and warranties of the Borrower and each other Loan Party contained in Article VI or any other Loan Document, or which are contained in any document furnished at any time under or in connection herewith or therewith, shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the effective date of such increase, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section, the representations and warranties contained in clauses (a) and (b) of Section 6.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) , respectively, of Section 7.01 , and (z) the Administrative Agent shall have received each of the following, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent: (i) if not previously delivered to the Administrative Agent, copies certified by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Borrower or 

Guarantor, as applicable, of (A) all corporate and other necessary action taken by the Borrower to authorize such increase and (B) all corporate and other necessary action taken by each Guarantor authorizing the guaranty of such increase; (ii) an opinion of counsel to the Borrower and the Guarantors, and addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders covering such matters as reasonably requested by the Required Lenders, in form and content similar to the opinion provided to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(v) or such other form acceptable to the Administrative Agent, and (iii) to the extent requested, new Notes executed by the Borrower, payable to any new Lenders and replacement Notes executed by the Borrower, payable to any existing Lenders increasing the principal amount of their Loans. Any Lender receiving such a replacement Note shall promptly return to the Borrower the Note that was replaced. In connection with any additional Loans made pursuant to this Section 2.16 , any Lender becoming a party hereto shall execute such documents and agreements as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request. The Borrower shall pay such fees to the Administrative Agent, for its own account and for the benefit of the Lenders providing such additional Loans, as determined at the time of such increase. 
 (c) This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.14 or 11.01 to the contrary. 2.17 [Intentionally Omitted]. 2.18 Defaulting Lenders. (a) Adjustments . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law: 
 (i) Waivers and Amendments . That Defaulting Lender s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 11.01 . 

(ii) Reallocation of Payments . Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article IX or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.08 ), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first , to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; fourth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth , to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.18(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 (iii) Certain Fees . No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Fee payable pursuant to Section 2.10(a) for any period during which such Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender). (b) Defaulting Lender Cure . If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders, whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided , further , that except to the extent otherwise expressly 

 agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. ARTICLE III. TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 3.01 Taxes. (a) Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes . (i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to the extent permitted by applicable Laws be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes. If, however, applicable Laws require the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to withhold or deduct any Tax, such Tax shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with such Laws as determined by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below. 

(ii) If the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. 
 (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower . Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws.
 (c) Tax Indemnifications . (i) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, the Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) withheld or deducted by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The Borrower shall also, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required by clause (ii) of this subsection. A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 (ii) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, each Lender shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, against any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by any Governmental Authority as a result of the failure by such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and expenses and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), as the case may be, to deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any documentation required to be delivered by such Lender to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (e) . Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii) . The agreements in this clause (ii) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 
 (d) Evidence of Payments . Upon request by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01 , the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the 

original, or if acceptable to the recipient a certified copy, of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be. 

(e) Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation . (i) Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable Laws or when reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Laws or by the taxing authorities of any jurisdiction and such other reasonably requested information as will permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine (A) whether or not payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document are subject to Taxes, (B) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction, and (C) such Lender s entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender s status for withholding tax purposes in the applicable jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in paragraphs (e)(ii)(A) and (ii)(B) of this Section 3.01) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, 
 (A) any Lender that is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and
 (B) each Foreign Lender that is entitled under the Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
 (I) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,
 (II) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,
 (III) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY and all required supporting documentation,

(IV) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or
 (V) executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. (iii) Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent make any withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. 

 (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds . Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f) , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 3.02 Illegality; Inability to Determine Rates . 

(a) If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate or the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate or the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the applicable interbank market (each an Affected SOFR Loan ), then (i) such Lender shall promptly give written notice of such circumstances to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, which notice shall be withdrawn whenever such circumstances no longer exist, (ii) the obligation of such Lender hereunder to make Affected SOFR Loans, continue Affected SOFR Loans as such and to convert a Base Rate Loan to an Affected SOFR Loan shall forthwith be cancelled and, until such time as it shall no longer be unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain such Affected SOFR Loans, such Lender shall then have a commitment only to make a Base Rate Loan when an Affected SOFR Loan is requested, and (iii) such Lender s Loans then outstanding as Affected SOFR Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans (A) with respect to any Term SOFR Loans, on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods or within such earlier period as required by Law and (B) with respect to any Daily Simple SOFR Loans, immediately. If any such conversion or prepayment of an Affected SOFR Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 3.05 . (b) If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a SOFR Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan or the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate with respect to a proposed Daily Simple SOFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain a SOFR Loans of the affected Type shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loan or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate, the utilization of the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans of the affected Type or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 3.03 Benchmark Replacement Setting . 
 (a) Benchmark Replacement . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document (and any Swap Contract shall be deemed not to be a Loan Document for purposes of this Section titled Benchmark Replacement Setting ), if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on 

the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. 
 (b) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes . In connection with the implementation and administration of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 

(c) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations . The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (A) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, (B) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (C) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes, (D) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to paragraph (iv) below and (E) the commencement of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section.
 (d) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (A) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate and either (I) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (II) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (B) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (A) above either (I) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (II) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
 (e) Benchmark Unavailability Period . Upon the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, (i) the Borrower may revoke any request for a Loan bearing interest based on the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate, conversion to or continuation of Loans bearing interest based on the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate, as applicable, to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Loan of or conversion to Loans bearing interest under the Base Rate and (ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans (A) with respect to any Term SOFR Loans, at the end of the applicable Interest Period and (B) with respect to any Daily Simple SOFR Loans, immediately. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Base Rate.
 3.04 Increased Costs. (a) Increased Costs Generally . If any Change in Law shall: 
 (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender;

(ii) subject any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any SOFR Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender); or 

(iii) impose on any Lender any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or SOFR Loans made by such Lender; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, maintaining, continuing or converting to any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided that such Lender shall not be entitled to submit a claim for compensation hereunder unless such Person shall have determined that the making of such claim is consistent with its general practices under similar circumstances in respect of similarly situated borrowers with credit agreements entitling it to make such claims (it being agreed that none of Lenders shall be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information in connection with such determination or the making of such claim). 
 (b) Capital Requirements . If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity ratios or requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 (c) Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 (d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

 (e) Limitations upon Participant Rights .

Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 11.09 Interest Rate Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate ).

Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.12 , if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.

(d) in the case of any such assignment under subsection (iii) above, the assignee assuming such obligations has agreed to vote in favor of such amendment, modification or waiver; and such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.
