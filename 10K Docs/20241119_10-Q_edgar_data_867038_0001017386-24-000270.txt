 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

. At the time of the sale, the
Company s unamortized full cost pool was approximately . 

Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X adopted the conveyance accounting requirements
in FASB Statement No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies (which has been codified in FASB 932,
Extractive Activities Oil and Gas), for all oil and gas entities, with certain modifications for entities applying the full cost
method. Under this standard, entities following the full cost method of accounting record sales of oil and gas properties, whether or
not being amortized currently as adjustments of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized, unless such adjustments would significantly
alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to a cost center. If a gain or loss is
recognized on such a sale, total capitalization costs within the cost center shall be allocated between reserves sold and reserves retained
on the same basis used to compute amortization, unless there are substantial economic differences between the properties sold and those
retained, in which case capitalized cost shall be allocated on the basis of the relative fair value of the properties. 

In accordance with the aforementioned accounting pronouncements, the Company
determined that an adjustment to capitalized costs for this sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs
and proved oil and gas reserves. As a result, the Company recorded a gain on the sale of the property in the amount of 104,000 related
to the sale. In determining the gain on the sale of the property, the Company considered that the Company s most recent reserve
report contained no reserves associated with the properties sold, and therefore, no adjustment to capitalized costs.

Item 2. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and 

 Results of Operations 

WARNING CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. 

This Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the caption Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements in this report, or which
management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on management s beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information
currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, expect, intend, 
 may, might, plan, estimate, project, 

 should, will, result and similar
expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are
subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown
risks, trends, uncertainties, and factors, that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize,
or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected.
We caution you that while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future
performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility
to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should
use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate
future results or trends. 

Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance
or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the factors
listed and described at Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which investors should review.
There have been changes to the risk factors previously described in the Company s Form 10-K. for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2023 (the Form 10-K ), including significant global economic and pandemic factors occurring during 2023 and continuing
into 2024 which are described in the following two paragraphs. 

Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely. Among the interrelated
factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are: 

the duration and economic and financial impact of epidemics,
pandemics or other public health issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; 

domestic and worldwide supplies of, and consumer and industrial/commercial
demand for oil and natural gas; 

domestic and international drilling activity; 

the actions of other oil producing and exporting nations,
including the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; 

worldwide economic conditions, geopolitical factors and political
conditions, including, but not limited to, the imposition of tariffs or trade or other economic sanctions, political instability or armed
conflict in oil and gas producing regions; 

the availability, proximity and capacity of appropriate transportation,
gathering, processing, compression, storage, and refining and export facilities; 

the price and availability of, and demand for, competing
energy sources, including alternative energy sources; 

the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures, alternative
fuel requirements and climate change-related legislation, policies, initiatives and developments. 

technological advances and consumer and industrial/commercial
behavior, preferences and attitudes, in each case affecting energy generation, transmission, storage and consumption: 

the nature and extent of governmental regulation, including
environmental and other climate change-related regulation, regulation of financial derivative transactions and hedging activities, tax
laws and regulations and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of oil, and natural gas and related commodities: 

the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets,
including trading by commodity price speculators and others; and 

natural disasters, weather conditions and changes in weather
patterns. 

11 

The above-described factors and the volatility of commodity prices make
it difficult to predict oil and natural gas prices during 2024 and thereafter. As a result, there can be no assurance that the prices
for oil and/or natural gas will sustain, or increase from, their current levels, nor can there be any assurance that the prices for oil
and/or natural gas will not decline. The Company continues to assess and monitor the impact of these factors and consequences on the Company
and its operations. 

Our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations depend to
a great extent on prevailing commodity prices. Accordingly, substantial and extended declines in commodity prices can materially and adversely
affect the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and operating costs; the terms on which we can access the
credit and capital markets; our results of operations; and our financial condition. As a result, the trading price of our common stock
may be materially and adversely affected. Lower commodity prices can also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce
economically. Substantial and extended declines in the prices of these commodities can render uneconomic a portion of our exploration
and development projects, resulting in our having to make downward adjustments to our estimated reserves and also possibly shut in or
plug and abandon certain wells. In addition, significant prolonged decreases in commodity prices may cause the expected future cash flows
from our properties to fall below their respective net book values, which would require us to write down the value of our properties.
Such reserve write-downs and asset impairments can materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and,
in turn, the trading price of our common stock. 

Rising inflation and other uncertainties regarding the global economy, financial
environment, and global conflict could lead to an extended national or global economic recession. A slowdown in economic activity caused
by a recession would likely reduce national and worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and result in lower commodity prices. Prolonged,
substantial decreases in oil and natural gas prices would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial
condition, and results of operations, and could further limit the Company's access to liquidity and credit and could hinder its ability
to satisfy its capital requirements. 

In the past several years, capital and credit markets have experienced volatility
and disruption. Given the levels of market volatility and disruption, the availability of funds from those markets may diminish substantially.
Further, arising from concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of borrowers specifically, the cost
of accessing the credit markets has increased as many lenders have raised interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, or altogether
ceased to provide funding to borrowers. 

Due to these potential capital and credit market conditions, the Company
cannot be certain that funding will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company. The Company is evaluating whether current
cash balances and cash flow from operations alone would be sufficient to provide working capital to fully fund the Company's operations.
Accordingly, the Company is evaluating alternatives, such as joint ventures with third parties , or sales of interest in one or
more of its properties. Such transactions, if undertaken, could result in a reduction in the Company's operating interests or require
the Company to relinquish the right to operate the property. There can be no assurance that any such transactions can be completed or
that such transactions will satisfy the Company's operating capital requirements. If the Company is not successful in obtaining sufficient
funding or completing an alternative transaction on a timely basis on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company would be required to
curtail its expenditures or restructure its operations, and the Company would be unable to continue its exploration, drilling, and recompletion
program, any of which would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

A negative shift in some of the public s attitudes
toward the oil and natural gas industry could adversely affect the Company s ability to raise debt and equity capital. Certain segments
of the investment community have developed negative sentiments about investing in the oil and natural gas industry. In addition, some
investors, including investment advisors and certain wealth funds, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated
policies to disinvest in the oil and natural gas sector based on their social and environmental considerations. Certain other stakeholders
have also pressured commercial and investment banks to halt financing oil and natural gas production and related infrastructure projects.
Such developments, including environmental, social and governance ESG activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate
change and reducing air pollution, could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and natural gas companies. The Company s
stock price could be adversely affected by these developments. This may also potentially result in a reduction of available capital funding
for potential development projects, impacting on the Company s future financial results. 

12 

The Company faces various risks associated with increased negative attitudes
toward oil and natural gas exploration and development activities. Opposition to oil and natural gas drilling and development activities
has been growing globally and is expanding in the United States. Companies in the oil and natural gas industry are often the target of
efforts from both individuals and nongovernmental organizations regarding safety, human rights, climate change, environmental matters,
sustainability, and business practices. Anti-development groups are working to reduce access to federal and state government lands and
delay or cancel certain operations such as drilling and development along with other activities. Opposition to oil and natural gas activities
could materially and adversely impact the Company s ability to operate our business and raise capital. 

There could be adverse legislation which if passed, would significantly
curtail our ability to attract investors and raise capital. Proposed changes in the Federal income tax laws which would eliminate or reduce
the percentage depletion deduction and the deduction for intangible drilling and development costs for small independent producers, will
significantly reduce the investment capital available to those in the industry as well as our Company. Lengthening the time to expense
seismic costs will also have an adverse effect on our ability to explore and find new reserves. 

Other factors that may affect the demand for oil and natural gas, and therefore
impact our results, include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns; increased competitiveness of,
or government policy support for, alternative energy sources; changes in technology that alter fuel choices, such as technological advances
in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power generation; changes in consumer preferences for our products, including
consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric transportation or alternatives to plastic products; and broad-based changes in personal
income levels. 

Commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors
affecting supply. For example, increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery
from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand. 

Other sections of this report may also include suggested factors that could
adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment.
New risks may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such matters; nor can we assess the impact
of all such matters on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and
current reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through
Forms 8-K or otherwise.

Results of Operations 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to nine months ended September
30, 2023 

Oil and gas revenues for the first nine months of 2024 were 2,600,000,
as compared to 3,459,000 for the same period in 2023 a decrease of approximately 859,000 or 24.8 , due primarily to lower oil and gas
production and natural gas prices. 

Oil sales for the first nine months of 2024 were approximately 1,699,000
compared to approximately 2,062,000 for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of approximately 363,000 or 17.6 . Oil sales volumes
for the first nine months of 2024 were approximately 20,325 bbls, compared to approximately 26,567 bbls during the same period in 2023,
a decrease of approximately 6,242 bbls, or 23.5 , 

Average oil prices received were 76.22 per bbl in the first nine months
of 2024 compared to 73.79 per bbl in the first nine months of 2023, an increase of approximately 2.43 per bbl or 3.3 . 

Natural gas revenue for the first nine months of 2024 was 901,000 compared
to 1,397,000 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of approximately 496,000 or 35.5 . Natural gas sales volumes for the first nine
months of 2024 were approximately 378,000 mcf compared to approximately 471,000 mcf during the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of
approximately 93,000 mcf or 19.8 . 

Average gross natural gas prices received were 2.37 per mcf in the first
nine months of 2024 as compared to 2.97 per mcf in the same time period in 2023, a decrease of approximately 0.60 per mcf or 20.2 . 

In general, revenues from oil and gas producing operations experienced a
significant decrease for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases resulted in part from decreased
volumes produced as well as decreases in gas prices. 

Revenues from lease operations were 127,000 in the first nine months of
2024 compared to 114,000 in the first nine months of 2023, an increase of approximately 13,000 or 11.4 . Revenues from lease operations
are derived from field supervision charged to operated leases along with operator overhead charged to operated leases. 

Revenues from gas gathering, compression and equipment rental for the first
nine months of 2024 were 74,000 compared to 78,000 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of approximately 4,000 or 5.13 . These revenues
are derived from gas volumes produced and transported through the Company owned gas gathering systems. 

Real estate revenue was approximately 187,000 during the first nine months
of 2024 compared to 204,000 for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of approximately 17,000, or 8.3 . 

Interest income was 721,000 during the first nine months of 2024 as compared
to 533,000 during the same period in 2023, an increase of approximately 188,000 or 35.3 . Interest income is due to the Company investing
its funds in both long-term and short-term certificates of deposit accounts paying higher rates of interest than those received in money
market accounts. 

Other revenues for the first nine months of 2024 were 37,000 as compared
to 40,000 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of approximately 3,000 or 7.5 . 

Lease operating expenses in the first nine months of 2024 were 1,283,000
as compared to 898,000 in the first nine months of 2023 a net increase of 385,000, or 42.87 . 

Production taxes, gathering and marketing expenses in the first nine months
of 2024 were approximately 451,000 as compared to 507,000 for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of approximately 56,000, or
11.1 . 

Pipeline and rental expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were 16,000
compared to 17,000 for the same time period in 2023, a decrease of approximately 1,000, or 5.9 . 

Real estate expenses in the first nine months of 2024 were approximately
 89,000 compared to 86,000 during the same period in 2023, an increase of approximately 3,000 or 3.5 .

of 2024 were 146,000 as compared to 77,000 for the same period in 2023. Amortization of the amount for the full cost pool for the first
nine months of 2024 was 74,000 compared to 23,000 for the same period of 2023. The Company re-evaluated its proved oil and natural gas
reserve quantities as of December 31, 2023. This re-evaluated reserve base was reduced for oil and gas reserves that were produced or
sold during the first nine months of 2024 and adjusted for newly acquired reserves or for changes in estimated production curves and future
price assumptions. A year-to-date depletion rate of 16.750 was applied to the Company s full cost pool of un-depleted capitalized
oil and natural gas properties compared to a year-to-date rate of 11.059 for the nine-month periods of 2024 and 2023 respectively. 

Asset Retirement Obligation ARO expense for the first nine
months of 2024 was approximately 100,000 as compared to approximately 572,000 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of approximately
 472,000 or 82.5 . The ARO expense is calculated to be the discounted present value of the estimated future cost to plug and abandon the
Company s producing wells. 

General and administrative expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were
approximately 1,724,000 as compared to approximately 1,755,000 for the same period of 2023, a decrease of approximately 31,000 or 1.8 . 

During the first quarter of 2023, the Company sold its interest in five
operated wells and associated leasehold acreage in various counties in the state of Arkansas for 104,000. At the time of the sale, the
Company s unamortized full cost pool was approximately 230,000. The Company determined that an adjustment to capitalized costs
for this sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved oil and gas reserves. As a result, the Company
recorded a gain on the sale of the property in the amount of 104,000 related to the sale. In determining the gain on the sale of the
property, the Company considered that the Company s most recent reserve report contained no reserves associated with the property
sold, and therefore, no adjustment to capitalized costs was necessary. 

Three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to three months ended
September 30, 2023 

Oil and natural gas revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
were 745,000, compared to 1,517,000 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of approximately 772,000, or 50.9 .

to approximately 1,033,000 for the same period of 2023, a decrease of approximately 548,000 or 53.1 . Oil volumes sold for the third
quarter of 2024 were approximately 6,631 bbls compared to approximately 9,792 bbls during the same period of 2023, a decrease of approximately
3,161 bbl or 32.3 . 

Average oil prices received were approximately 74.56 per bbl in the third
quarter of 2024 compared to 72.66 per bbl during the same period of 2023, an increase of approximately 1.90 per bbl, or 2.6 . 

Natural gas revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were 260,000 compared
to 484,000 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of approximately 224,000 or 46.3 . Natural gas volumes sold for the third quarter
of 2024 were approximately 140,000 mcf compared to approximately 194,000 mcf during the same period of 2023, a decrease of approximately
54,000 mcf, or 27.8 , 

Average gross natural gas prices received were approximately 2.24 per mcf
in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to approximately 2.49 per mcf during the same period in 2023 a decrease of approximately 0.25
or 10.0 . 

In general, revenues from oil and gas producing operations experienced a
significant decrease for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases resulted in part from decreased
gas prices as well as decreased production for both oil and gas. 

Revenues from lease operations for the third quarter of 2024 were approximately
 40,000 compared to approximately 39,000 for the same period in 2023, an increase of approximately 1,000 or 2.6 . Revenues from lease
operations are derived from field supervision charged to operated leases along with operator overhead charged to operated leases.

quarter of 2024 were approximately 29,000, compared to approximately 35,000 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of approximately
 6,000 or 17.1 . These revenues are derived from gas volumes produced and transported through our gas gathering systems. 

Real estate revenue was approximately 63,000 during the third quarter of
2024 compared to 68,000 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of approximately 5,000 or 7.4 .

as compared with approximately 209,000 for the same period in 2023, an increase of approximately 42,000 or 20.1 . Interest income is
derived from investments in both short-term and long-term certificates of deposit as well as money market accounts at banks. 

Other revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were approximately 11,000
as compared with approximately 15,000 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of approximately 4,000 or 26.7 . 

Lease operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were approximately
 354,000 as compared to 419,000 in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of approximately 65,000 or 15.5 . 

Production taxes, gathering, transportation and marketing expenses for the

 71,000 or 37.2 . 

Pipeline and rental expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were 6,000 compared
to 5,000 for the same period in 2023 an increase of approximately 1,000, or 20.0 . 

Real estate expenses during the third quarter 2024 were approximately 52,000
compared to approximately 25,000 for the same period in 2023, an increase of approximately 27,000 or 108.0 . 

Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expenses for the third quarter
of 2024 were 65,000 as compared to 31,000 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 34,000, or 109.7 . Amortization of the amount
for the full cost pool for the third quarter of 2024 was 41,000 compared to 13,000 for the same period of 2023. The Company re-evaluated
its proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities as of December 31, 2023. This re-evaluated reserve base was reduced for oil and gas
reserves that were produced or sold during the first nine months of 2024 and adjusted for newly acquired reserves or for changes in estimated
production curves and future price assumptions. 

ARO expense is calculated to be the discounted present value of the estimated
future cost to plug and abandon the Company s producing wells. No provision for ARO accretion expense was made for the third quarter
2024. 

General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were 484,000
compared to 533,000 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of approximately 49,000 or 9.2 . 

Financial Condition and Liquidity 

The Company's operating capital needs, as well as its capital spending program
are generally funded from cash flow generated by operations. Because future cash flow is subject to several variables, such as the level
of production and the sales price of oil and natural gas, the Company can provide no assurance that its operations will provide cash sufficient
to maintain current levels of capital spending. Accordingly, the Company may be required to seek additional financing from third parties
to fund its exploration and development programs. 

Item 4. - Controls and Procedures 

(a) As of the end of the period covered by this report, Spindletop Oil
