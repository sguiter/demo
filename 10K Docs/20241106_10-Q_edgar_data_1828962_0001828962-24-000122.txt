 million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The provision for income taxes varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a reduction in the unfavorable prior-period adjustments, increases in the foreign derived intangible income deduction, and a million decrease from discrete items related to stock-based compensation. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the income tax provision varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation difference attributable to the decrease in stock price upon vesting versus the stock price at the grant date and a decrease to the research and development credit. 
 The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for realization based upon historical taxable income, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and expected future taxable income. The Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets for any of the periods presented.

 , combining its Subscriptions and digital content businesses into one Platform segment, and its Connected Machines and Accessories and Materials businesses into one Product segment. Prior period segment results have been retrospectively recast to reflect the new reportable segments. 
 The CODM reviews revenue and gross profit for each of the reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue incurred by the segment. The Company considered the provisions of ASC 280-10-50 as it relates to the information provided to and used by the CODM for evaluating performance and allocating resources to operating segments. 
 The Company does not allocate assets at the reportable segment level as these are managed on an entity wide group basis. As of September 30, 2024, long-lived assets located outside the United States, primarily located in Malaysia and China, were million.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed, or incorporated by reference, in the sections titled Risk Factors and Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 
 Overview of Our Business and History 
 At Cricut, our mission is to help people lead creative lives. We have designed and built a creativity platform that enables our engaged and loyal community of nearly 5.9 million Active Users to turn ideas into professional-looking handmade goods. We define Active User as a registered user of at least one registered connected machine who has utilized their connected machine to create a project in the last 365 days. With our highly versatile Design Space Platform and our products, including our connected machines and accessories and materials, our users create everything from personalized birthday cards, mugs and T-shirts, to large-scale interior decorations. 
 Our users journeys typically begin with the purchase of a connected machine. We currently sell a portfolio of connected machines that cut, write, score and create other decorative effects using a wide variety of materials including paper, vinyl, iron-on vinyl, pens, and more. Our connected machines are designed for a wide range of uses and are available at a variety of price points (MSRP by machine family as of September 30, 2024): 
 Cricut Joy family for personalization, organization, and customization, 149.00 - 199.00 MSRP 
 Cricut Explore family for cutting, writing and scoring, 249.00 - 319.00 MSRP 
 22 

Cricut Maker family for cutting, writing, scoring and adding decorative effects to a wider range of materials, 399.00 - 429.00 MSRP 
 Cricut Venture for cutting, writing, and scoring large-format projects at professional speeds, 999.00 MSRP 
 Our platform integrates our design apps and connected machines, allowing our users to create and share seamlessly. Our software is cloud-based, meaning that users can access and work on their projects anywhere, at any time, across desktops or mobile devices. We enable our users to be inspired, to create and share projects with the Cricut community and to follow others doing the same. On our platform, users can find inspiration, purchase or upload content like fonts and images, design a project from scratch or find a vast array of ready-to-make projects. 
 Users can leverage the full power of our platform by using our connected machines together with our free design apps, in-app purchases and subscription offerings to design and complete projects. All users can access a select number of free images, fonts and projects from our design apps or upload their own. In addition, we offer a wider selection of images, fonts and projects for purchase la carte, including licensed content from partners with well-known brands and characters, like major motion picture studios. We also have two subscription offerings: 
 Cricut Access: Provides a subscription to images, fonts and projects as well as other member benefits, including exclusive software features and functionality, discounts, and priority Cricut Member Care. Cricut Access is billed monthly for 9.99 per month or annually for 95.88 per year. 
 Cricut Access Premium: Includes all of the benefits of Cricut Access as well as additional discounts and preferred shipping and is billed annually for 119.88 per year. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had over 2.8 million Paid Subscribers to Cricut Access and Cricut Access Premium. 
 We sell a broad range of accessories and materials that bring our users designs to life, from advanced tools like heat presses to Cricut-branded rulers, scoring tools, pens, paper and iron-on vinyl, all designed to work seamlessly with our connected machines. Designing and completing projects drives repeat purchases of Cricut-branded accessories and materials. 
 We design and develop our software and hardware products, and we work with third-party contract manufacturers to source components and finished goods and with third-party logistics companies to warehouse and distribute our products. 
 We sell our connected machines and accessories and materials through our brick-and-mortar and online retail partners, as well as through our website at cricut.com. Our partners include Amazon, Hobby Lobby, HSN, Jo-Ann, Michaels, Target, Walmart and many others. We also sell our products and subscriptions to Cricut Access and Cricut Access Premium on cricut.com. 
 Historically, we have experienced the highest revenue levels in the fourth quarter of the year, coinciding with the holiday shopping season in the United States. For example, in 2021, 2022 and 2023, our fourth quarter represented 30 , 32 and 30 of total revenue for the year, respectively. Our promotional discounting activity is higher in the fourth quarter as well, which negatively impacts gross margin during this period. For example, gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 42 , compared to gross margin of 45 for all of 2023. Additionally, sales of accessories and materials typically rise and fall with seasonal holiday crafting periods. The yearly seasonality patterns experienced in 2021, 2022, and 2023 are not representative of our typical historical patterns due to the unique aspects of the pandemic and condition of the global economy. For example, we experienced unusually high demand in the first and second quarters of 2021, which is inconsistent with normal seasonality patterns. In 2022, we experienced a deceleration of sales post-Q1 due to the global economic slowdown which drove a deviation from our typically expected seasonality. As the impact of the pandemic and global economic challenges on behaviors abate, we expect to return to a more normal seasonality pattern. As we continue to grow internationally, we expect we may experience seasonality in additional markets, which may differ from the seasonality experienced in the United States. 
 In January 2024, the Company reevaluated its operating segments in order to better align with how the CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources. The key factor evaluated by the Company resulted from the growth and expansion of Design Space, the Company s digital platform. Since its initial public offering, the Company s digital platform has evolved and grown considerably. Key enhancements to the platform include the size 
 23 

of its images, fonts, and projects library, the introduction of advanced design tools, the software support for several new cutting machines, and the creation of enhanced subscriptions offerings. In 2020, revenue and gross profit generated from the platform represented 12 and 31 of total, respectively. In 2023, revenue and gross profit generated from the platform represented 40 and 80 of total, respectively. Over this same time period, Paid Subscribers on the platform grew 115 from 1.3 million to nearly 2.8 million. The change in operating segments reflects the Company s strategy to focus on continuing to expand revenue and margin generated from its digital platform and Paid Subscribers. At the same time, a number of product related factors also contributed to this decision, including the relative importance of physical products to the platform, including bundles (comprised of several combinations of machines, accessories, and materials), and changes in our Accessories and Materials business. Based on these changes, the Company has determined that it was appropriate to reduce its reportable segments from three to two, combining its Subscriptions and digital content businesses into one Platform segment, and its Connected Machines and Accessories and Materials businesses into one Product segment. Prior period segment results have been retrospectively recast to reflect the new reportable segments.

 Key Business Metrics 
 In addition to the measures presented in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends and make strategic decisions. 
 As of September 30, 2024 2023 Active Users (in thousands) 5,894 5,929 90-Day Engaged Users (in thousands) 3,532 3,641 Paid Subscribers (in thousands) 2,838 2,699 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Platform ARPU 52.86 51.20 
 Active Users 
 We define Active Users as registered users of at least one registered connected machine who have utilized their connected machine to create a project in the last 365 days. One user may own multiple registered connected machines but is only counted once if that user registers those connected machines by using the same email address. If possession of a connected machine is transferred to a new owner and registered by that new owner, the new owner is added to the total Active Users and the prior owner is removed from the total Active Users if the prior owner does not own any other registered connected machines. Active Users is a key indicator of the health of our business, because changes in the number of Active Users excludes non-users to better represent opportunities for us to drive additional platform and accessories and materials revenue. 
 90-Day Engaged Users 
 We define 90-Day Engaged Users as registered users of at least one registered connected machine who have utilized their connected machine to create a project in the last 90 days. One user may own multiple registered connected machines but is only counted once if that user registers those connected machines by using the same email address. If possession of a connected machine is transferred to a new owner and registered by that new owner, the new owner is added to the total 90-Day Engaged Users and the prior owner is removed from the total 90-Day Engaged Users if the prior owner does not own any other registered connected machines. 90-Day Engaged Users excludes non-users to better represent opportunities for us to drive additional platform and accessories and materials revenue. 
 24 

Paid Subscribers 
 We define Paid Subscribers as the number of users with a subscription to Cricut Access or Cricut Access Premium, excluding cancelled, unpaid or free trial subscriptions, as of the end of a period. Paid Subscribers is a key metric to track growth in our Platform revenue and potential leverage in our gross margin. 
 Platform ARPU 
 We define Platform ARPU as Platform revenue in a 12-month period divided by Active Users. Platform ARPU allows us to forecast Platform revenue over time and is an indicator of our ability to expand with users and of user engagement with our subscription offerings. 
 
 Components of our Results of Operations 
 We operate and manage our business in two reportable segments: Platform and Products. We identify our reportable segments based on the information used by management to monitor performance and make operating decisions. See Note 16 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing for additional information regarding our reportable segments. 
 Revenue 
 Platform 
 We generate Platform revenue primarily from sales of subscriptions to Cricut Access and Cricut Access Premium, digital content, and a minimal amount of revenue allocated to the unspecified future upgrades and enhancements related to the essential software and access to our cloud-based services. For a monthly or annual subscription fee, Cricut Access includes a subscription to images, fonts and projects as well as other member benefits, including exclusive software features and functionality, discounts, and priority Cricut Member Care. For our annual subscription fee, Cricut Access Premium includes all the benefits of Cricut Access as well as additional discounts and preferred shipping. Digital content includes la carte digital content purchases, including fonts, images and projects. Platform revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over time, during the subscription term for subscriptions, and at the point in time when control is transferred for la carte digital content. 
 Products 
 We generate Products revenue from sales of connected machines and ancillary products, net of sales discounts, incentives and returns, and includes amounts allocated to the material right for discounts on materials and accessories available only to Paid Subscribers. Our connected machines portfolio consists of machines in four product families: Cricut Maker, which includes Maker and Maker 3; Cricut Explore, which includes Explore Air 2 and Explore 3; Cricut Joy, which includes Joy and Joy Xtra; and Cricut Venture. Our ancillary products include Cricut EasyPress, Cricut MugPress, hand tools, machine replacement tools and blades, and project materials such as vinyl and iron-on. Products revenue is recognized at the point in time when control is transferred, which is either upon shipment or delivery to the customer in accordance with the terms of each customer contract. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Platform 
 Cost of revenue related to Platform consists primarily of hosting fees, digital content costs, amortization of capitalized software development costs and software maintenance costs. We expect our cost of revenue related to Platform as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate in the near term as we expand our content offerings, including localized content for international target markets, and decrease over time as we drive greater scale and efficiency in our business. 
 Products 
 Cost of revenue related to Products consists of product costs, including costs of components, cost of contract manufacturers for production, inspecting and packaging, shipping, receiving, handling, warehousing and fulfillment, duties and other applicable importing costs, warranty replacement, excess and obsolete inventory write-downs, tooling and equipment depreciation and royalties. We expect our cost of revenue related to Products as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate in the near term as we continue selling through end of life machines, address 
 25 

global supply chain challenges and continue to invest in the growth of our business and decrease over the long term as we drive greater scale and efficiency in our business. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the development of our platform and products, including personnel-related expenses for engineering, product development and quality assurance, as well as prototype costs, service fees incurred by contracting with vendors and allocated overhead. We expect our research and development expenses to fluctuate in the near term as we refine our product roadmaps. We expect to produce gross savings of approximately 3.2 million during 2024 as a result of the Q1 2024 restructuring plan. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the advertising and marketing of our products, third-party payment processing fees, personnel-related expenses, including salaries and bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, as well as sales incentives, professional services, promotional items, and allocated overhead costs. We expect our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate in the near term. We expect to produce gross savings of approximately 2.5 million during 2024 as a result of the Q1 2024 restructuring plan. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses for our finance, legal, human resources and administrative personnel, including salaries and bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, as well as the costs of professional services, any allocated overhead, information technology, impairment charges of unused equipment, and other administrative expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to increase in the near term as we expand our operations, invest in systems enhancements, and incur expenses required of a public company. We expect to produce gross savings of approximately 0.6 million during 2024 as a result of the Q1 2024 restructuring plan. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net consists primarily of interest income from our investments in marketable securities, offset by interest expense associated with our debt financing arrangements and amortization of debt issuance costs. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes consists of income taxes in the United States and certain state and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have not recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.

 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 6.9 million, or 24 , to 35.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 28.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 5.7 million increase in advertising and other marketing costs and a 1.7 million increase in personnel-related expense, partially offset by a decrease in software and website subscriptions expense. 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 14.3 million, or 16 , to 101.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 87.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 11.2 million increase in advertising and other marketing costs and a 3.6 million increase in personnel-related expense, partially offset by a decrease in software and website subscriptions expense. 
 General and Administrative 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 (dollars in thousands) General and administrative 16,249 13,962 2,287 16 50,494 55,334 (4,840) (9) As a percentage of total revenue 10 8 10 10 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 2.3 million, or 16 , to 16.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 4.5 million net reversal of bad debt expense in Q3 2023. This was partially offset by a loss on foreign currency translation and decreases in impairment of unused equipment, software, and inventory. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 4.8 million, or 9 , to 50.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 55.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 2.8 million decrease in bad debt expense and a 1.6 million decrease in professional services.

 Other income, net increased by 1.7 million or 95 to 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest income due to an increase in maturities of marketable securities in 2024. 
 Other income, net increased by 2.2 million or 28 to 10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest income due to an increase in maturities of marketable securities in 2024.

Income Tax Expense 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 (dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes 2,674 8,290 (5,616) (68) 21,340 18,952 2,388 13 
 Provision for income taxes decreased by 5.6 million, or 68 , to 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in unfavorable prior-period adjustments due to the filing of the prior-year tax returns in Q3, increases in the foreign derived intangible income deduction, and a decrease from discrete items related to stock-based compensation. 
 Provision for income taxes increased by 2.4 million, or 13 , to 21.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation difference attributable to the decrease in stock price upon vesting versus the stock price at the grant date, and a decrease to the research and development credit. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our operations during the periods presented have been financed primarily through cash flow from operating activities. We believe our balances of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, which totaled 142.4 million and 104.6 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, along with forecasted cash expected to be generated by ongoing operations and 300.0 million in available borrowings and the option to increase the aggregate amount of our credit facility by up to an additional 150.0 million (see Note 7) will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond. Except for the dividends announced in May and November 2024 and the share repurchase program announced in May 2024, our cash requirements have not changed materially since our Annual Report. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid a dividend of 109.8 million and 293.8 million to holders of Class A and Class B common stock, respectively. 
 Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other growth initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations, and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital. The inability to raise capital would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash flows provided by operating activities 
 161,885 196,026 Net cash flows used in investing activities (14,436) (43,998) Net cash flows used in financing activities 
 (147,402) (304,324) 
 Operating Activities 
 The change in net cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in the provision for obsolete inventory, a smaller reduction in accounts receivable in 2024 compared to 2023, an increase in prepaid balances due to estimated tax payments made in 2024, and a decrease in accounts payable driven by a decrease in foreign 
 31 

trade payables due to lower inventory purchases in 2024, offset by a decrease in inventory from current year sales and the inventory replenishment rate decreasing as the Company works to reduce inventory levels and an increase in accrued liabilities related to income taxes payable. 
 Investing Activities 
 The change in net cash flows from investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to an increase in proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities in 2024. 
 Financing Activities 
 The change in net cash flows from financing a ctivities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to dividend payments of 293.8 million in 2023 compared to the dividend payment in 2024 of 109.8 million, offset by an increase in the repurchase of common stock in 2024 . 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The critical accounting policies that reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements include those described in Note 2 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements in the section titled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 For a discussion of the Company s market risk, please refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report. There have been no material changes to the Company s market risk during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control 
 32 

system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been or would be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are not presently a party to any material pending legal proceedings. We are, from time to time, subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the normal course of business activities, and an unfavorable resolution of any of these matters could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 Litigation may be necessary, among other things, to defend ourselves or our users by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party proprietary rights, to establish our proprietary rights, or to address royalty payments we make. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part II. Item 1A Risk Factors in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024, filed on May 7, 2024, which are hereby incorporated by reference. The risks and uncertainties described in such risk factors and elsewhere in this report have the potential to materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, projected results and future prospects. We do not believe that there have been any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our recent SEC filings, including our previously filed Form 10-Q, as referenced above, as updated by our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, filed on August 6, 2024.
