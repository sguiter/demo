 continued thereafter from year to year if approved annually by the Board of Directors or the Company s stockholders, including, in each case, a majority of the directors who are not interested persons as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the Independent Directors ). 
 On January 24, 2024, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser (as amended and restated, the Investment Advisory Agreement ). The Investment Advisory Agreement incorporates (i) a cumulative lookback provision and (ii) a cap on quarterly income incentive fee payments based on net realized capital loss, if any, during the applicable lookback period. The Investment Advisory Agreement will continue from year to year if approved annually the Board of Directors or the Company s stockholders, including, in each case, a majority of the Independent Directors. 
 The Company pays the Investment Adviser a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components: a base management fee (the Base Management Fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the Base Management Fee and the incentive fee are ultimately be borne by the stockholders. 
 Base Management Fee 
 The Base Management Fee is calculated at an annual rate of of the Company's average gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage but excluding cash and cash equivalents. 
 Pursuant to the Original Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser agreed to irrevocably waive the portion of the Base Management Fee in excess of of the Company s average gross assets calculated in accordance with the Original Investment Advisory Agreement prior to a listing of the Common Stock on a national securities exchange. 
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser has agreed to irrevocably waive any portion of the Base Management Fee in excess of of the Company's average gross assets calculated in accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement for the period from January 24, 2024 to January 24, 2025 (the Waiver Period ). 
 Base Management Fees waived during the Waiver Period are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Base Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears. Base Management Fees for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately pro-rated. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Base Management Fees were and , net of waiver, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Base Management Fees were and , net of waiver, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, were payable to the Investment Adviser relating to Base Management Fees. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee consists of two components that are determined independently of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. One component is based on income and the other component is based on capital gains. 
 i. Incentive Fee Based on Income 
 The first part is determined and paid quarterly based on the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income, and is subject to an Incentive Fee Cap (as defined below) pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. Pre-incentive fee net investment income is defined as interest income, dividend income and any other income accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter, including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below), any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. The Investment Adviser is not obligated to return any incentive fee it receives on PIK interest that is later determined to be uncollectible in cash. 
 Pursuant to the Original Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company paid its Adviser an income-based incentive fee with respect to the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows:

 annualized); 
 of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than annualized). This portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than is referred to as the catch-up . This catch-up portion is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if the catch up is achieved; and 
 of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the rate of return of annualized). 
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company pays its Adviser an incentive fee on its aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of (1) for the quarter ending March 31, 2024 (the First Calendar Quarter ), the First Calendar Quarter, and (2) commencing with the quarter ending June 30, 2024, the current calendar quarter and eleven preceding calendar quarters beginning with the calendar quarter commencing on April 1, 2024 (or the appropriate portion thereof in the case of any of our first eleven calendar quarters that commence on or after April 1, 2024) (in either case, the Trailing Twelve Quarters ). 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the First Calendar Quarter will be compared to a hurdle rate equal to annualized), and, if pre-incentive fee net investment income for the First Calendar Quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, the incentive fee will be of pre-incentive fee net investment income until the Adviser has received a catch up equal to , plus of pre-incentive fee net investment income above the catch up. 
 Commencing with the quarter ending June 30, 2024, pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters will be compared to a Hurdle Rate equal to the product of (i) the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized) and (ii) the sum of the Company's net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The incentive fee based on income for each calendar quarter will be determined as follows: 
 
 No incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income in any calendar quarter in which pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters does not exceed the Hurdle Rate; 
 of pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than in any calendar quarter annualized). This portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than is referred to as the catch-up. The catch-up is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately of the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 
 of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters that exceeds in any calendar quarter annualized), which reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income that exceeds the catch-up amount is paid to the Adviser. 
 
 Commencing with the quarter ending June 30, 2024, each income incentive fee will be subject to an incentive fee cap (the Incentive Fee Cap that in respect of any calendar quarter is an amount equal to of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined herein) during the Trailing Twelve Quarters less the aggregate incentive fees based on income that were paid to the Adviser in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. In the event the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value then no income incentive fee shall be payable and if the Incentive Fee Cap is less than the amount of incentive fee based on income that would otherwise be payable, the amount of incentive fee based on income shall be reduced to an amount equal to the Incentive Fee Cap. 
 
 Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (A) during the First Calendar Quarter, the sum of pre-incentive fee net investment income in the First Calendar Quarter and (B) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters, the sum of (x) pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters and (y) Adjusted Capital Returns (as defined below) in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any calendar quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company shall pay no income incentive fee to the Adviser in respect of that quarter. If, in any calendar quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is a positive value but is less than the incentive fee calculated as described above, the Company shall pay the Adviser the Income Incentive Fee Cap in respect of such quarter. If, in any calendar quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is equal to or greater than the incentive fee calculated as described above, the Company shall pay the Adviser the incentive fee in respect of such quarter. Adjusted Capital Returns in respect of a particular period means the sum of aggregate realized losses and aggregate realized capital gains in respect of such period.

 instead of and (2) a catch-up amount (as applicable) calculated using in place of . For periods in which the waiver described in this paragraph is in effect for less than a full quarter or calendar year, as applicable, the applicable incentive fee shall be calculated at a weighted rate during the applicable days in such period during the Waiver Period. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, income based incentive fees were and , net of waiver respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, income based incentive fees were and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, were payable to the Investment Adviser relating to income based incentive fees. 
 
 ii. Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains 
 
 The second part of the incentive fee is determined on realized capital gains calculated and payable in arrears in cash as of the end of each calendar year or upon the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement in an amount equal to of realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the date of the Company's election to be regulated as a BDC through the end of a given calendar year or upon the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees (the Cumulative Capital Gains ). For the purpose of computing the incentive fee on capital gains, the calculation methodology looks through derivative financial instruments or swaps as if the Company owned the reference assets directly. Therefore, realized gains and realized losses on the disposition of any reference assets, as well as unrealized depreciation on reference assets retained in the derivative financial instrument or swap, will be included on a cumulative basis in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee 
 
 For the calendar years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025, the Adviser has irrevocably waived any capital gains incentive fee in excess of amounts calculated as described above using instead of in the calculation of any such capital gains incentive fee solely with respect to the Waiver Period, such that the capital gains incentive fee shall be calculated at a weighted rate calculated based on this waiver being applicable only during the applicable days in such calendar year during the Waiver Period, based, in each case, on the number of days in the applicable year. 
 
 Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is required to accrue an incentive fee on capital gains, including unrealized capital appreciation even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not included in calculating the incentive fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then the Company records an incentive fee on capital gain incentive fee equal to (or during the Waiver Period) of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. If such amount is negative, no accrual is recorded for such period. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Investment Adviser accrued and capital gains incentive fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Investment Adviser accrued and capital gains incentive fees. The Investment Advisory Agreement does not permit unrealized capital appreciation for purposes of calculating the amount payable to the Investment Adviser. Amounts due related to unrealized capital appreciation, if any, will not be paid to the Investment Adviser until realized under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and determined based on the calculation. Incentive fees on Cumulative Capital Gains crystallize at calendar year-end. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, were payable to the Investment Adviser relating to capital gains incentive fees payable.

 The significant unobservable input used in yield analysis is discount rate based on comparable market yields. Significant increases in discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. The significant unobservable input used in the market approach is the comparable company multiple. The multiple is used to estimate the enterprise value of the underlying investment. An increase/decrease in the multiple would result in an increase/decrease, respectively, in the fair value. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the comparative yield or discount rate. The comparative yield and discount rate are used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment. An increase/decrease in the comparative yield or discount rate would result in a decrease/increase, respectively, in the fair value.

 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements.

 OVERVIEW 
 We are a non-diversified, externally managed specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. We are externally managed by our Adviser, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. We are not a subsidiary of, or consolidated with, Morgan Stanley. 
 Our investment objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns via current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by investing primarily in directly originated senior secured term loans issued by U.S. middle-market companies in which private equity sponsors have a controlling equity stake in the portfolio company. For the purposes of this Report, middle-market companies refers to companies that, in general, generate annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") in the range of approximately 15 million to 200 million, although not all of our portfolio companies will meet this criterion. 
 We invest primarily in directly originated senior secured term loans including first lien senior secured term loans (including unitranche loans) and second lien senior secured term loans, with the balance of our investments expected to be in higher-yielding assets such as mezzanine debt, unsecured debt, equity investments and other opportunistic asset purchases. Typical middle-market senior loans may be issued by middle-market companies in the context of leveraged buyouts ("LBOs"), acquisitions, debt refinancings, recapitalizations, and other similar transactions. We generally expect our debt investments to have a stated term of five to eight years and typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark (such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR). 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends or distributions of income on any direct equity investments, capital gains on the sale of loans and equity investments and various other loan origination and other fees, including commitment, origination, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. 
 Pursuant to the exemptive relief granted by the SEC to us and our Adviser (as amended, the "Order"), we are able to enter into certain negotiated co-investment transactions alongside certain Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds (each as defined in the Order) in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies, and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with the Order. Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our eligible directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies. 
 We have applied for a new exemptive relief order which, if granted, would supersede the Order with respect to negotiated co-investment transactions alongside certain Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds (each as defined in the application) . There can be no assurance that we will obtain such new exemptive relief from the SEC. 
 
 KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle-market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends or distributions of income on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of five to eight years and typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as SOFR, or historically LIBOR. Interest on these debt investments is generally paid quarterly. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we may receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. 
 We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees.

Weighted average EBITDA, net leverage through the tranche that the Company is a lender, interest coverage and loan to value exclude recurring revenue investments, which are investments in portfolio companies in which the Company lends based on a multiple of recurring revenue generated by the portfolio company and not based on a multiple of EBITDA. 
 2 Amounts were derived from investment due diligence information provided by the portfolio company. Such amounts have not been independently estimated by us, and accordingly, we take no responsibility for such numbers and make no representation or warranty in respect of this information. 
 3 Computed as (a) the annual stated spread, plus reference rate, as applicable, plus the annual accretion of discounts, as applicable on debt securities divided by (b) total debt investments (at fair value or cost, as applicable) included in such securities. Actual yields earned over the life of each investment could differ materially from the yields presented herein. 
 4 Net leverage is the ratio of total debt minus cash divided by EBITDA and taking into account leverage through the tranche that the Company is a lender, excluding recurring revenue investments. 
 5 Interest coverage for a particular portfolio company is calculated by taking credit agreement EBITDA and dividing by annualized latest reported interest expense. Total interest coverage is calculated on a weighted average basis based on total gross debt commitments (funded and unfunded). Calculation excludes recurring revenue deals which are investments in portfolio companies in which the Company lends based on a multiple of recurring revenue generated by the portfolio company and not based on a multiple of EBITDA. Portfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the reported end date. Statistics of the portfolio companies have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. 
 6 Calculated using total outstanding debt through the tranche that the Company is a lender divided by total enterprise value from the private equity sponsor or market comparables.

Investment Performance Rating 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments. Our Investment Adviser has developed a classification system to group investments into four categories. The investments are evaluated regularly and assigned a category based on certain credit metrics. Our Investment Adviser s ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. Please see below for a description of the four categories of the Investment Adviser s Internal Risk Rating system: 
 Risk Rating 1 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 1 involve the least amount of risk relative to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. Risk Rating 1 investments performance is above our initial underwriting expectations and the business trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company, or the likelihood of a potential exit. 
 Risk Rating 2 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 2 involve a level of risk relative to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. Risk Rating 2 investments are generally performing in line with our initial underwriting expectations and risk factors to ultimately recoup the cost of our principal investment are neutral to favorable. All new originated or acquired investments are initially included in Risk Rating 2. 
 Risk Rating 3 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 3 indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition has increased materially since the origination or acquisition of the investment, such as declining financial performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, principal and interest payments are not more than 120 days past due. 
 82 

Table of Contents 

 Risk Rating 4 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 4 involve a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicate that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For Risk Rating 4 investments, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition upon exit. 
 The distribution of our portfolio on the Investment Adviser s Internal Risk Rating System is as follows: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Fair Value of Total Fair Value of Total Risk rating 1 5,950 0.2 Risk rating 2 3,577,427 98.3 3,126,464 97.9 Risk rating 3 62,897 1.7 49,257 1.5 Risk rating 4 0.0 (1)

The increase was primarily driven by our increased borrowings. Our debt outstanding (at par) increased from 1,725,252 as of September 30, 2023 to 1,841,987 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Management Fees 
 Base management fees, net of waiver, were 6,825 and 1,938 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and 18,437 and 5,625 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increases were primarily due to an increase in average gross assets as well as the management fee waiver pre and post IPO. Refer to Note 3 Related Party Transactions for additional information about the management fee waiver. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee consists of two components: (1) income based incentive fee and (2) capital gains incentive fee. The income based incentive fees, net of waiver, were 8,448 and 10,727 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 and 28,476 and 30,246 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Refer to Note 3 Related Party Transactions for additional information about the incentive fees waiver. 
 Professional Fees, Administrative Service Fee and Other Expenses 
 Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, valuation and other professional fees incurred related to the management of our Company. Administrative service fee represents fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers that perform duties for us. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs. 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments 
 For the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investment transactions: Net realized gain (loss): Non-controlled/non-affiliated investments (10,965) 5 (16,482) 127 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation): Non-controlled/non-affiliated investments 5,442 22,829 10,916 30,909 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) (5,523) 22,834 (5,566) 31,036 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 net realized losses on our investments was (10,965) and (16,482), which was primarily due to the restructuring of one and four portfolio companies, respectively. 
 84 

Table of Contents 

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net change in unrealized appreciation on our investments of 5,442 and 10,916, was primarily the result of the changes in spreads in the primary and secondary markets, partially offset by the reversal of unrealized depreciation in connection with the aforementioned restructuring. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, net change in unrealized appreciation on our investments of 22,829 and 30,909, respectively, was primarily driven by changes in spreads in the primary and secondary markets. 
 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We generate cash from the net proceeds of offerings of our Common Stock, net borrowings from our credit facilities, and net proceeds of our unsecured debt issuances and through cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments as well as income earned on investments. Details of our credit facilities and unsecured debt issuance are described in Debt below. We may from time to time enter into new credit facilities, increase the size of existing credit facilities or issue additional debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 88.4 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, which taken together with our approximately 354.0 million and 748.7 million of availability under the BNP Funding Facility and the Truist Credit Facility (subject to borrowing base availability) (each as defined in Note 6. Debt in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), respectively, we expect to be sufficient for our investing activities and sufficient to conduct our operations in the near term. As of September 30, 2024, we believed we had adequate financial resources to satisfy unfunded portfolio company commitments of 552.4 million. 
 Equity 
 On January 26, 2024, we closed our Initial Public Offering ("IPO"), issuing 5,000,000 shares of our Common Stock at a public offering price of 20.67 per share. Net of underwriting fees, we received net cash proceeds, before offering expenses, of approximately 97.1 million. Our Common Stock began trading on the NYSE under the symbol MSDL on January 24, 2024. 
 In connection with the IPO, the Company redeemed any fractional shares of Common Stock outstanding for cash in an amount equal to the pro rata portion of 20.67 per share of Common Stock, which was the initial public offering price in the IPO. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did not issue any capital calls to purchase Common Stock pursuant to such subscription agreements. 
 Distributions and Dividend Reinvestment 
 Prior to January 26, 2024, we had an opt in dividend reinvestment plan, or the DRIP. As a result, our stockholders who elected to opt in to the DRIP had their cash dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock, rather than receiving cash. We adopted an opt out DRIP effective as of January 26, 2024. As a result, our stockholders who have not opted out of the DRIP will have their cash dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock, rather than receiving cash. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of Common Stock will generally be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions; however, those stockholders will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes. For more information, see Recent Developments.

 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 On November 4, 2024, the Board declared a distribution of 0.50 per share, which is payable on January 24, 2025 to shareholders of record as of December 31, 2024. 
 Since September 30th, 2024, we repurchased 238,951 shares at an average price of 19.95, as part of our 10b5-1 plan. 
 
 Amendment to Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
 
 We have adopted an amendment to its opt out DRIP, to be effective December 7, 2024, to clarify that the DRIP plan administrator will not issue fractional shares in the DRIP and instead will issue cash in lieu of such fractional shares in an amount equal to the 
 86 

Table of Contents 

 difference between the cash distributions declared and payable to such DRIP plan participant and the value of the whole shares of our Common Stock issued to such participant pursuant to the DRIP. 
 
 No action is required on the part of our registered stockholders to have their cash dividend or other distribution reinvested in shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the DRIP, as amended as described above. A registered stockholder may elect to receive an entire distribution in cash by notifying the plan administrator and our transfer agent and registrar in writing so that such notice is received by the plan administrator no later than 10 days prior to the record date for distributions to stockholders. Those stockholders who hold shares of our Common Stock through a broker or other financial intermediary may receive dividends and other distributions in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting estimates including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, should be read in connection with our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, including Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies. 
 
 We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Investments, Revenue Recognition, Deferred Financing Costs and Debt Issuance Costs and Income Taxes. The valuation of investments is our most significant critical estimate. The most significant input is the discount rate used in yield analysis that is based on comparable market yields. Significant increases in the discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. For a further discussion and disclosure of key inputs and considerations related to this estimate, refer to "Note 5 Fair Value Measurements" included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following (which are defined 
 in the notes to the accompanying unaudited financial statements if not defined herein): 
 the Investment Advisory Agreement; and 
 the Administration Agreement 
 See Note 3. Related Party Transactions to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, market risk and interest rate risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of portfolio companies. During periods of market dislocation, we will seek to invest prudently in the secondary loan market to provide our investors better risk adjusted returns while adhering to our core investment tenants. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price. To ensure accurate valuations, our investments are valued at fair value in good faith by the Board based on, among other things, the input of the Investment Adviser, including the Valuation Designee, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board of Directors, or Valuation Designee, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the investments we hold. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Market Risk 
 The market value of a security may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. These fluctuations may cause a security to be worth less than the price originally paid for it, or less than it was worth at an earlier time. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, sector of the economy or the market as a whole. Global economies and financial markets are increasingly interconnected, which increases the probabilities that conditions in one country or region might adversely impact issuers in a different country or region. Conditions affecting the general economy, including political, social, or economic instability at the local, regional, or global level, may also affect the market value of a security. Health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases, as well as other incidents that interrupt the expected course of events, such as natural disasters, war or civil disturbance, acts of terrorism, power outages and other unforeseeable and external events, and the public response to or fear of such diseases or events, have and may in the future have an adverse effect on a company s investments and net asset value and can lead to increased market volatility. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors General Risk Factors We are operating in a period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty. The conditions have materially and adversely affected debt and equity capital markets in the United States, and any future volatility or instability in capital markets may have a negative impact on our business and operations. of our Form 10-K and "Part I, Item 1A.

Table of Contents 

 Risk Factors General Risk Factors Terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters, outbreaks or pandemics, such as the Coronavirus pandemic, may impact our portfolio companies and our Adviser and harm our business, operating results and financial condition of our Form 10-K. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 99.6 of our debt investments were at floating rates. Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical reference rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors and ceilings for floating rate debt instruments assuming no changes in our investments and borrowing structure as of September 30, 2024) (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Interest Interest Net Basis Point Change - Interest Rates Income Expense (1) 
 Income Up 300 basis points 108,960 (34,230) 74,730 Up 200 basis points 72,640 (22,820) 49,820 Up 100 basis points 36,320 (11,410) 24,910 Up 25 basis points 9,080 (2,853) 6,227 Down 25 basis points (9,080) 2,853 (6,227) Down 100 basis points (36,320) 11,410 (24,910) Down 200 basis points (72,640) 22,820 (49,820) Down 300 basis points (108,960) 34,230 (74,730) 
 (1) Includes the impact of our interest rate swaps as a result of interest rate changes. 
 We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts or our credit facilities, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates or higher exchange rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates or investments denominated in foreign currencies. During the periods covered by this Report, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this Report), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them of material information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company, the Adviser and the Administrator may become party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Each of the Company, the Adviser and the Administrator is not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against the Company. See also Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 88 

Table of Contents 

 In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and the risk factors previously disclosed under Item 1A of the Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. The risks disclosed below and disclosed in the Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 
 We may be subject to risks associated with our investments in the commercial services and supplies industry. 
 
 We could invest in portfolio companies in the commercial services and supply industry and a downturn in the industry could significantly impact the aggregate returns we realize on such investments. For example, the operating results and financial condition of our portfolio companies in the commercial services and supplies industry could be adversely affected due to a number of factors, including but not limited to a decrease in demand for their services or supplies relating to seasonality or market forces and various other factors. In addition, there are risks involved with sales, marketing, managerial and related capabilities of our portfolio companies in the commercial services and supplies industry. For example, recruiting and training a workforce is expensive and time-consuming and could delay the provision of commercial services, result in diminished services, or delay the delivery of supplies. If our portfolio companies in the commercial services and supplies industry fail to devote resources and attention to sell and market their services or products effectively, they could fail to generate sufficient revenues and reach or sustain profitability and to repay interest or principal on our debt investments. Any of these factors could affect our portfolio company investments and, in turn, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Amended and restated 
 DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN 
 OF MORGAN STANLEY DIRECT LENDING FUND 
 
 Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund, a Delaware corporation (the Company ), has adopted the following plan (the Plan ), effective as of December 7, 2024, to be administered by State Street Bank and Trust Company and its affiliates or such other administrator as the Company may appoint (the Plan Administrator ), with respect to dividends and other distributions declared by its board of directors (the Board of Directors on shares of common stock of the Company, par value 0.001 per share (the Common Stock ). 
 
 1. Unless a stockholder specifically elects to receive cash as set forth below, all cash dividends or other distributions hereafter declared by the Board of Directors, net of any applicable withholding tax, shall be automatically reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock, and no action shall be required on such stockholder s part to receive a distribution in Common Stock. 
 
 2. Such distributions shall be payable on such date or dates as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors to stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date established by the Board of Directors for the distribution involved. 
 
 3. With respect to each distribution pursuant to this Plan, the Board of Directors reserves the right, subject to the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, to either issue new shares of Common Stock or to make open market purchases of its shares of Common Stock for the accounts of Participants (as defined below). The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to a Participant is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to such stockholder by the market price per share of Common Stock at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of such distribution provided that in the event the market price per share of Common Stock on the date of such distribution and or the price to be paid by the Company to acquire shares of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange pursuant to this Plan exceeds the most recently computed net asset value per share of Common Stock, the Company shall issue shares of Common Stock at the greater of the most recently computed net asset value per share of Common Stock or 95 of the current market price per share of Common Stock (or such lesser discount to the current market price per share that still exceeds the most recently computed net asset value per share of Common Stock). The market price per share of Common Stock on a particular date shall be the closing price for such shares on the New York Stock Exchange on such date or, if no sale is reported for such date, at the average of their reported bid and asked prices. 
 
 4. The Plan Administrator may establish an account for shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Plan for each stockholder who has not so elected to receive distributions in cash (each, a Participant or may otherwise record the ownership of the shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Plan. Each Participant s shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Plan may be held together with the shares of other Participants in non-certificated form. The Plan Administrator shall not issue share certificates to any Participant. 
 
 5. The Plan Administrator shall confirm to each Participant each acquisition made pursuant to the Plan as soon as practicable but not later than 30 business days after the payable date. 
 
 6. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to the Plan, and Participants who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Common Stock pursuant to Plan shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash in an amount equal to the difference between the distributions declared and payable to such Participant and the value of the whole shares of Common Stock issued to such Participant pursuant to the Plan. 
 
 7. In the event that the Company makes available to its stockholders rights to purchase additional shares or other securities, the shares held by the Plan Administrator for a Participant under the Plan shall be added to any other shares held by the Participant in calculating the number of rights to be issued to the Participant. Transaction processing may be either curtailed or suspended until the completion of any stock dividend, stock split or corporate action. 

8. The Plan Administrator s service fee, if any, and expenses for administering the Plan shall be paid for by the Company. Except as explicitly provided herein, there will be no brokerage charges or other charges to Participants. 
 
 9. Each Participant may elect to receive an entire distribution in cash by notifying the Plan Administrator in writing so long as such notice is received by the Plan Administrator no later than 10 calendar days prior to the record date for such distribution to stockholders, otherwise the election will be effective only with respect to any subsequent distribution. 
 
 10. Each Participant may terminate his, her or its account under the Plan by so notifying the Plan Administrator by submitting a letter of instruction terminating the Participant s account under the Plan to the Plan Administrator. Such termination shall be effective immediately if the Participant s notice is received by the Plan Administrator no later than 10 calendar days prior to the record date for an applicable distribution otherwise, such termination shall be effective only with respect to any subsequent distributions. The Plan may be terminated or amended by the Company upon written notice at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of any distributions by the Company. Upon any termination, the Plan Administrator shall cause the shares of Common Stock held for each Participant under the Plan to be delivered to the Participant. 
 
 11. These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Company at any time but, except when necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Administrator receives written notice of the termination of the Participant s participation in the Plan. Any such amendment may include an appointment in the place and stead of the Plan Administrator of a successor agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Administrator under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any agent for the purpose of receiving distributions, the Company shall be authorized to pay to such successor agent, for each Participant s account, all distributions payable on shares of the Company held in the Participant s name or under the Plan for retention or application by such successor agent as provided in these terms and conditions. 
 
 12. The Plan Administrator shall at all times act in good faith and use its best efforts within reasonable limits to ensure its full and timely performance of all services to be performed by it with respect to purchases and sales of the Company s Common Stock under this Plan and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless such error is caused by the Plan Administrator s negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or that of its employees or agents. 
 
 13. These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.
