 Total asset recurring fair value measurements Liabilities: Deferred compensation and other retirement plans Total liability recurring fair value measurements Financial instruments not carried at fair value Total debt Total financial instruments not carried at fair value 
 The Company determines the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities using the following methodologies: 
 Investments These instruments include equity mutual funds and corporate bond funds. The fair value is obtained based on observable market prices quoted on public exchanges for similar instruments. 
 Deferred compensation and other retirement plans These include obligations related to deferred compensation and other retirement plans adjusted for market performance. The fair value is obtained based on observable market prices quoted on public exchanges for similar instruments. 
 Debt These instruments are recorded at cost and include the Credit Facilities and Senior Notes maturing through 2034. The fair value of these debt instruments is obtained based on observable market prices quoted on public exchanges for similar instruments. 
 The methodologies used by the Company to determine the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024, are the same as those used as of December 31, 2023. The carrying values of Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts and notes receivable, net, Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities are a reasonable estimate of their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. 
 The Company also had investments in debt and equity securities without readily determinable fair values of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which are classified as Other noncurrent assets within the Condensed and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Net revenues are shown by tangible product sales and services, as contract terms, conditions and economic factors affecting the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty around revenue recognition and cash flows are substantially similar within each of these two principal revenue streams. Product sales involve contracts with a single performance obligation, the transfer of control of a product or bundle of products to a customer. Service revenue, which includes inspection, maintenance and repair, design and installation, aftermarket and locksmith services, as well as software-as-a-service offerings such as access control, IoT integration and workforce management solutions, is delayed until the service performance obligations are satisfied. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, contract assets related to the Company s right to consideration for work completed but not billed were not material. The Company does not have any costs to obtain or fulfill a contract that are capitalized on its Condensed and Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no adjustments related to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods were recorded. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, contract liabilities related to revenues allocated to remaining performance obligations totaled million and million, respectively, and are classified as Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities within the Condensed and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company largely evaluates performance based on Segment operating income and Segment operating margins. Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that the Company s chief operating decision maker, the chief executive officer, uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation, performance reviews and compensation. For these reasons, the Company believes that Segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss. The Company s chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains, such as corporate charges and other special charges, from Operating income to arrive at a Segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base operating decisions.

 Net Revenues 
 Net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 5.4 , or 49.2 million, compared with the same period in 2023, due to the following: 
 Pricing 1.8 Volume 1.5 Acquisitions 1.9 Currency exchange rates 0.2 Total 5.4 
 The increase in Net revenues was driven by improved pricing, higher volumes, the acquisitions made during the year, and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. 
 Pricing includes increases or decreases of price, including discounts, surcharges and/or other sales deductions, on our existing products and services. Volume includes increases or decreases of revenue due to changes in unit volume of existing products and services, as well as new products and services. 
 Operating Income/Margin 
 Operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 21.9 million compared to the same period in 2023. Operating margin, which we define as Operating income as a percentage of total Net revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased to 22.2 from 21.0 for the same period in 2023, due to the following: 
 In millions Operating Income Operating Margin September 30, 2023 193.1 21.0 Pricing and productivity in excess of inflation and investment spending 6.9 0.4 Volume / product mix 6.9 0.4 Acquisitions 4.1 0.1 Currency exchange rates 2.5 0.1 Acquisition / integration/ restructuring expenses 1.5 0.2 September 30, 2024 215.0 22.2 
 The increase in Operating income and Operating margin was driven by pricing and productivity improvements in excess of inflation and investment spending, favorable volume/product mix, the contribution to operating income from recent acquisition activity, favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and lower acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses. 
 Pricing and productivity in excess of inflation and investment spending includes the impact to both Operating income and Operating margin from pricing, as defined above, in addition to productivity, inflation and investment spending. Productivity represents improvements in unit costs of materials, cost reductions related to improvements to our manufacturing design and

 processes and reductions in selling and administrative expenses due to productivity projects. Inflation includes both unit costs for the current period compared to the average actual cost for the prior period, multiplied by current year volumes, and current period costs of ongoing selling and administrative functions compared to the same ongoing expenses in the prior period. Expenses related to increased head count for strategic initiatives, new facilities or other significant spending for strategic initiatives or new product and channel development, are captured in investment spending. 
 Volume/product mix represents the impact to both Operating income and Operating margin due to increases or decreases of revenue due to changes in unit volume, including new products and services, including the effect of changes in the mix of products and services sold on Cost of goods sold. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 5.9 million compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher outstanding indebtedness compared to the same period in the prior year.

 The increase in interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 is due to higher cash on hand and higher interest rates earned on deposits. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The effective income tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 10.5 and 8.1 , respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate compared to 2023 is primarily due to the enactment of global minimum tax in 2024, the unfavorable year over year change in the amounts recognized for uncertain tax positions and the unfavorable mix of income earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions.

Review of Business Segments 
 We operate in and report financial results for two segments: Allegion Americas and Allegion International. These segments represent the level at which our chief operating decision maker reviews our financial performance and makes operating decisions. 
 Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation, performance reviews and compensation. For these reasons, we believe that Segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of Segment profit and loss. Our chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains, such as corporate charges and other special charges, to arrive at a Segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions. We define Segment operating margin as Segment operating income as a percentage of the segment s Net revenues. 
 The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in Net earnings.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity Outlook, Sources and Uses 
 Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities is used to invest in new product development and fund capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities, our unused borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility and our access to the capital and credit markets enable us to fund these capital needs, execute our long-term growth strategies and return value to our shareholders. Further, our business operates with strong operating cash flows, low leverage and low capital intensity, providing financial flexibility, including sufficient access to credit markets. 
 Our short-term financing needs primarily consist of working capital requirements, restructuring initiatives, capital spending, dividend payments and principal and interest payments on our long-term debt. Long-term financing needs depend largely on potential growth opportunities, including potential acquisitions, repayment or refinancing of our long-term obligations and repurchases of our ordinary shares. Of our total outstanding indebtedness as of September 30, 2024, approximately 91 incurs fixed-rate interest and is therefore not exposed to the risk of rising variable interest rates. 
 Based upon our operations, existing cash balances and unused borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility, as of September 30, 2024, we expect our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to maintain a sound financial position and liquidity and to meet our current financing needs for at least the next 12 months. Further, we do not anticipate any covenant compliance challenges with any of our outstanding indebtedness for at least the next 12 months. We also believe existing borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility, together with financing we believe would be accessible to us in the credit and capital markets, are sufficient to achieve our longer-term strategic plans. 
 The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30. For additional details, see the Condensed and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the Condensed and Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In millions 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 456.0 381.1 Net cash used in investing activities (190.2) (83.4) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
 147.3 (219.9) 
 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 74.9 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by higher net earnings and lower cash used for working capital. 
 Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 106.8 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to cash used for acquisitions and higher capital expenditures. 
 Financing Activities: Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 367.2 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of the 5.600 Senior Notes. The increase was partially offset by an increase in the cash used to repurchase shares compared to the same period in 2023. Proceeds from the issuance of the 5.600 Senior Notes were used to repay the 3.200 Senior Notes on October 1, 2024.

 Historically, the majority of our earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested in jurisdictions where we have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our global operations. At September 30, 2024, we analyzed our working capital requirements and the potential tax liabilities that would be incurred if certain subsidiaries made distributions and concluded that no material changes to our historic permanent reinvestment assertions are required. 
 Defined Benefit Plans 
 Our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due. We seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status, contributions and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities. Global asset allocation decisions are based on a dynamic approach whereby a plan s allocation to fixed income assets increases as the funded status increases. We monitor plan funded status, asset allocation and the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans regularly in addition to investment manager performance. For further details on pension plan activity, see Note 9 to the Condensed and Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 For a further discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources, refer to Part II, Item 7, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Guarantor Financial Information 
 Allegion US Hold Co is or was, as applicable, the issuer of the 3.200 Senior Notes, 3.550 Senior Notes, 5.411 Senior Notes, and 5.600 Senior Notes and is the guarantor of the 3.500 Senior Notes. Allegion plc (the Parent is or was, as applicable, the issuer of the 3.500 Senior Notes and is or was, as applicable, the guarantor of the 3.200 Senior Notes, 3.550 Senior Notes, 5.411 Senior Notes, and 5.600 Senior Notes. Allegion US Hold Co is directly or indirectly 100 owned by the Parent and each of the guarantees of Allegion US Hold Co and the Parent is full and unconditional and joint and several. 
 The 3.200 Senior Notes, 3.550 Senior Notes, 5.411 Senior Notes, and 5.600 Senior Notes are or were, as applicable, senior unsecured obligations of Allegion US Hold Co and rank equally with all of Allegion US Hold Co s existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The guarantee of the 3.200 Senior Notes, 3.550 Senior Notes, 5.411 Senior Notes, and 5.600 Senior Notes is or was, as applicable, the senior unsecured obligation of the Parent and ranks equally with all of the Parent s existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The 3.500 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Parent and rank equally with all of the Parent s existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The guarantee of the 3.500 Senior Notes is the senior unsecured obligation of Allegion US Hold Co and ranks equally with all of Allegion US Hold Co's existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. 
 Each guarantee is effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness of the applicable guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of the subsidiaries of the applicable guarantor, none of which guarantee the notes. The obligations of the applicable guarantor under its guarantee are limited as necessary to prevent such guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law and, therefore, are limited to the amount that the applicable guarantor could guarantee without such guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance; this limitation, however, may not be effective to prevent such guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance. If the guarantee was rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the applicable guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, the applicable guarantor s liability on its guarantee could be reduced to zero. In such an event, the notes would be structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of the applicable guarantor. 
 For further details, terms and conditions of the Senior Notes refer to the Company s Forms 8-K filed October 2, 2017, September 27, 2019 June 22, 2022, and May 29, 2024. 
 The following tables present the summarized financial information specified in Rule 1-02(bb)(1) of Regulation S-X for each issuer and guarantor. The summarized financial information has been prepared in accordance with Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Condensed and Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgments in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from estimates. 
 Management believes there have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to the items we disclosed as our critical accounting policies in "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for t he year ended December 31, 2023. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 2 under the paragraph "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Since the date of the Company's most recent Annual Report, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective or adopted that we believe have a significant impact, or potential significant impact, to our condensed and consolidated financial statements.

Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk during the third quarter of 2024.
