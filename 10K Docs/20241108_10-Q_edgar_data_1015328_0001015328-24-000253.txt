 Equity securities without readily determinable fair values totaled million as of September 30, 2024. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are included as part of accrued interest receivable and other assets in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Condition. The Company monitors its equity investments without readily determinable fair values to identify potential transactions that may indicate an observable price change in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, requiring adjustment to its carrying amount. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company recorded upward or downward adjustments related to such observable price changes. The Company conducts a quarterly assessment of its equity securities without readily determinable fair values to determine whether impairment exists in such securities, considering, among other factors, the nature of the securities, financial condition of the issuer and expected future cash flows. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded impairment of equity securities without readily determinable fair values. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded million of impairment of equity securities without readily determinable fair values. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded impairment of equity securities without readily determinable fair values.

 The Company conducts a regular assessment of its investment securities to determine whether securities are experiencing credit losses. Factors for consideration include the nature of the securities, credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer, the extent of the unrealized loss, expected cash flows, market conditions and the Company s ability to hold the securities through the anticipated recovery period. 
 
 The Company does not consider available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 to be experiencing credit losses and recognized no resulting allowance for credit losses for such individually assessed credit losses. The Company does not intend to sell these investments and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these investments before recovery of the amortized cost bases, which may be the maturity dates of the securities. The unrealized losses within each category have occurred as a result of changes in interest rates, market spreads and market conditions subsequent to purchase. Available-for-sale securities with continuous unrealized losses existing for more than twelve months at September 30, 2024 were primarily mortgage-backed securities with unrealized losses due to increased market rates during such period. 
 
 See Note (7) Allowance for Credit Losses in Item 1 of this report for further discussion regarding any credit losses associated with held-to-maturity securities at September 30, 2024.

 The Company s loan portfolio is generally comprised of loans to consumers and small to medium-sized businesses, which, for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios, are located primarily within the geographic market areas that the banks serve. Various niche lending businesses, including franchise lending and insurance agency lending, operate on a national level. The premium finance receivables portfolios are made to customers throughout the United States and Canada. The Company strives to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse in terms of loan type, industry, borrower, and geographic concentrations. Such diversification reduces the exposure to economic downturns that may occur in different segments of the economy or in different industries. 
 
 Certain premium finance receivables are recorded net of unearned income. The unearned income portions of such premium finance receivables were million at September 30, 2024, million at December 31, 2023 and million at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Total loans, excluding purchased credit deteriorated PCD loans, include net deferred loan fees and costs and fair value purchase accounting adjustments totaling million at September 30, 2024, million at December 31, 2023 and million at September 30, 2023. 
 
 It is the policy of the Company to review each prospective credit in order to determine the appropriateness and, when required, the adequacy of security or collateral necessary to obtain when making a loan. The type of collateral, when required, will vary from liquid assets to real estate. The Company seeks to ensure access to collateral, in the event of default, through adherence to state lending laws and the Company s credit monitoring procedures.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized approximately million and million of provision for credit losses, respectively, related to loans and lending agreements, which includes million of Day 1 provision related to the acquisition of Macatawa. The provision for each period was primarily the result of losses experienced in the Commercial, Commercial Real Estate and Premium Finance Receivables portfolios along with growth across various segments, which was offset by improved macroeconomic forecasts related to Baa Credit Spread and CRE Price Index. Uncertainties remain regarding expected economic performance and macroeconomic forecasts utilized in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024.

 Additions from loans sold with servicing retained Servicing rights sold ) Estimate of changes in fair value due to: Payoffs, paydowns and repurchases ) ) ) ) Changes in valuation inputs or assumptions ) ) Fair value at end of the period Unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced for others 
 
 The Company recognizes MSR assets upon the sale of residential real estate loans to external third parties when it retains the obligation to service the loans and the servicing fee is more than adequate compensation. MSRs are included in other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. The initial recognition of MSR assets from loans sold with servicing retained and subsequent changes in fair value of all MSRs are recognized in mortgage banking revenue. MSRs are subject to changes in value from actual and expected prepayment of the underlying loans. 
 
 The estimation of fair value related to MSRs is partly impacted by the Company exercising its early buyout options EBO on eligible loans previously sold to the Government National Mortgage Association GNMA ). Under such optional repurchase program, financial institutions acting as servicers are allowed to buy back from the securitized loan pool individual delinquent mortgage loans meeting certain criteria for which the institution was the original transferor of such loans. At the option of the servicer and without prior authorization from GNMA, the servicer may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to the remaining principal balance of the loan. At the time of such repurchase, any MSR value related to such loans is derecognized. 
 
 The MSR asset fair value is determined by using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the objective characteristics of the portfolio as well as subjective valuation parameters that purchasers of servicing would apply to such portfolios sold into the secondary market. The subjective factors include loan prepayment speeds, discount rates, servicing costs and other economic factors. The Company uses a third party to assist in the valuation of MSRs. 
 
 Periodically, the Company will purchase options for the right to purchase securities not currently held within the banks investment portfolios or enter into interest rate swaps in which the Company elects not to designate such derivatives as hedging instruments. These option and swap transactions are designed primarily to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company s MSRs. The gain or loss associated with these derivative contracts is included in mortgage banking revenue. For more information regarding these hedges outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, see Note (14) Derivative Financial Instruments in Item 1 of this report.

 Secured Borrowings 
 
 The balance of secured borrowings primarily represents a third party Canadian transaction Canadian Secured Borrowing ). Under the Canadian Secured Borrowing, the Company, through its subsidiary, FIFC Canada, sells an undivided co-ownership interest in all receivables owed to FIFC Canada to an unrelated third party in exchange for cash payments pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement Receivables Purchase Agreement ). On August 29, 2024, the Company entered into the Twelfth Amending Agreement to the Receivables Purchase Agreement dated as of December 16, 2014. The amended Receivables Purchase Agreement provides for, among other things, an extension of the maturity date to December 15, 2025 and an increase to the facility limit from million to million. Additionally, Wintrust guarantees the performance of FIFC Canada of its obligations under the Receivables Purchase Agreement and any subsequent amendments thereto. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the translated balance of the secured borrowings totaled million compared to million at December 31, 2023 and million at September 30, 2023. The interest rate under the Receivables Purchase Agreement is the Canadian Commercial Paper Rate plus fee rate of .

 primary segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management. 
 
 The reportable segments are strategic business units that are separately managed as they offer different products and services and have different marketing strategies. In addition, each segment s customer base has varying characteristics and each segment has a different regulatory environment. While the Company s management monitors each of the bank subsidiaries operations and profitability separately, these subsidiaries have been aggregated into reportable operating segment due to the similarities in products and services, customer base, operations, profitability measures, and economic characteristics. 
 
 For purposes of internal segment profitability, management allocates certain intersegment and parent company balances. Management allocates a portion of revenues to the specialty finance segment related to loans and leases originated by the specialty finance segment and sold or assigned to the community banking segment. Similarly, for purposes of analyzing the contribution from the wealth management segment, management allocates a portion of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on deposit balances of customers of the wealth management segment to the wealth management segment. See Note (10) Deposits in Item 1 of this report for more information on these deposits. Finally, expenses incurred at the Wintrust parent company are allocated to each segment based on each segment s risk-weighted assets. 
 
 The segment financial information provided in the following table has been derived from the internal profitability reporting system used by management to monitor and manage the financial performance of the Company. The accounting policies of the segments are substantially similar to those described in Note (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the 2023 Form 10-K. The Company evaluates segment performance based on after-tax profit or loss and other appropriate profitability measures common to each segment.

 Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to net interest income and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and interest rate collars as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts to or from a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving or paying fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate collars designated as cash flow hedges involve the settlement of amounts in which the interest rate index specified in the contract exceeds the agreed upon cap strike rate or in which the interest rate index specified in the contract is below the agreed upon floor strike rate at the end of each period. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had various interest rate collar and swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate loans. When the relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument is highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and are subsequently reclassified to interest income as interest payments

 Total Cash Flow Hedges 
 
 In the first quarter of 2022, the Company terminated interest rate swap derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate deposits with a total notional value of billion and a term effective July 2022. At the time of termination, the fair value of the derivative contracts totaled an asset of million, with such adjustments to fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. In the second quarter of 2022, the Company terminated additional interest rate swap derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate deposits with a total notional value of million each effective since April 2020. The remaining terms of such derivative contracts were through March 2023 and April 2024 and, at the time of termination, the fair value of the derivative contracts totaled assets of million and million, respectively, with such adjustments to fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company terminated additional interest rate collar derivative contract designated as a cash flow hedge of a term borrowing facility with a total notional value of million effective since September 2018. The remaining term of such derivative contract was through September 2023 and, at the time of termination, the fair value of the derivative contract totaled an asset of , with such adjustments to fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. 
 
 For all such terminations, as the hedged forecasted transactions (interest payments on variable rate deposits and a term borrowing facility) are still expected to occur over the remaining term of such terminated derivatives, such adjustments will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and be reclassified as a reduction to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the original term of the terminated derivative contracts.

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company estimated that during the next 12 months million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as a decrease to net interest income. Such estimate consists of million reclassified as a reduction to interest expense on the terminated cash flow hedges discussed above and million reclassified as a reduction to interest income related to the interest rate collars and swaps noted above that remain outstanding. 
 
 Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million that were designated as fair value hedges primarily associated with fixed rate commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans as well as life insurance premium finance receivables. 
 
 For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss from the entire change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recognized in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect, including the net gain or loss, of the hedged item (interest income earned on fixed rate loans) when the hedged item affects earnings.

 interest rate caps outstanding that were designed to act as an economic hedge. 
 
 Additionally, the Company has interest rate derivatives, including swaps and option products, resulting from a service the Company provides to certain qualified borrowers. The Company s banking subsidiaries execute certain derivative products (typically interest rate swaps) directly with qualified commercial borrowers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. For example, these arrangements allow the Company s commercial borrowers to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate. In order to minimize the Company s exposure on these transactions, the Company simultaneously executes offsetting derivatives with third parties. In most cases, the offsetting derivatives have mirror-image terms, which result in the positions changes in fair value substantially offsetting through earnings each period. However, to the extent that the derivatives are not a mirror-image and because of differences in counterparty credit risk, changes in fair value will not completely offset resulting in some earnings impact each period. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in other non-interest income. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had interest rate derivative transactions with an aggregate notional amount of approximately billion and billion, respectively, (all interest rate swaps and caps with customers and third parties) related to this program. At September 30, 2024 these interest rate derivatives had maturity dates ranging from October 2024 to January 2037. 
 
 Mortgage Banking Derivatives These derivatives include interest rate lock commitments provided to customers to fund certain mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of such loans. It is the Company s practice to enter into forward commitments for the future delivery of a portion of its residential mortgage loan production when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of future changes in interest rates on its commitments to fund the loans as well as on its portfolio of mortgage loans held-for-sale. The Company s mortgage banking derivatives have not been designated as being in hedge relationships. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had interest rate lock commitments with an aggregate notional amount of approximately million and million, and forward commitments to sell mortgage loans with an aggregate notional amount of approximately million and million, respectively. The fair values of these derivatives were estimated based on changes in mortgage rates from the dates of the commitments. Changes in the fair value of these mortgage banking derivatives are included in mortgage banking revenue. 
 
 Commodity Derivatives The Company has commodity forward contracts resulting from a service the Company provides to certain qualified borrowers. The Company s banking subsidiaries execute certain derivative products directly with qualified commercial borrowers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. For example, these arrangements allow the Company s commercial borrowers to effectively purchase or sell a given commodity at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. In order to minimize the Company s exposure on these transactions, the Company simultaneously executes offsetting derivatives with third parties. In most cases, the offsetting derivatives have mirror-image terms, which result in the positions changes in fair value substantially offsetting through earnings each period. However, to the extent that the derivatives are not a mirror-image and because of differences in counterparty credit risk, changes in fair value will not completely offset resulting in some earnings impact each period. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in other non-interest income. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had commodity derivative transactions with an aggregate notional amount of approximately million and million, respectively, (all forward contracts with customers and third parties) related to this program. At September 30, 2024, these commodity derivatives had maturity dates ranging from October 2024 to October 2025. 
 
 Foreign Currency Derivatives The Company has foreign currency derivative contracts resulting from a service the Company provides to certain qualified customers. The Company s banking subsidiaries execute certain derivative products directly with qualified customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies related to foreign currency fluctuations. For example, these arrangements allow the Company s customers to effectively exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. In order to minimize the Company s exposure on these transactions, the Company simultaneously executes offsetting derivatives with third parties. In most cases, the offsetting derivatives have mirror-image terms, which result in the positions changes in fair value substantially offsetting through earnings each period. However, to the extent that the derivatives are not a mirror-image and because of differences in counterparty credit risk, changes in fair value will not completely offset resulting in some earnings impact each period. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in other non-interest income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held foreign currency derivatives with an aggregate notional amount of approximately million and million, respectively.

 Credit Risk 
 
 Derivative instruments have inherent risks, primarily market risk and credit risk. Market risk is associated with changes in interest rates and credit risk relates to the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform according to the terms of the agreement. The amounts potentially subject to market and credit risks are the streams of interest payments under the contracts and the market value of the derivative instrument and not the notional principal amounts used to express the volume of the transactions. Market and credit risks are managed and monitored as part of the Company s overall asset-liability management process, except that the credit risk related to derivatives entered into with certain qualified borrowers is managed through the Company s standard loan underwriting process since these derivatives are secured through collateral provided by the loan agreements. Actual exposures are monitored against various types of credit limits established to contain risk within parameters. When deemed necessary, appropriate types and amounts of collateral are obtained to minimize credit exposure. 
 
 The Company has agreements with certain of its interest rate derivative counterparties that contain cross-default provisions, which provide that if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. The Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision allowing the counterparty to terminate the derivative positions if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well or adequately capitalized institution, which would require the Company to settle its obligations under the agreements. As of September 30, 2024, there were million interest rate derivatives in a net asset position that were subject to such agreements. The fair value of such derivatives includes accrued interest related to these agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions and those derivatives subject to such agreements were in a liability position, and the derivatives were terminated as a result, the Company would have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value and would have been required to pay any additional amounts due in excess of amounts previously posted as collateral with the respective counterparty. 
 
 The Company is also exposed to the credit risk of its commercial borrowers who are counterparties to interest rate derivatives with the banks. This counterparty risk related to the commercial borrowers is managed and monitored through the banks standard underwriting process applicable to loans since these derivatives are secured through collateral provided by the loan agreement. The counterparty risk associated with the mirror-image swaps executed with third parties is monitored and managed in connection with the Company s overall asset liability management process.

million of municipal securities as Level 3. These municipal securities are bond issues for various municipal government entities primarily located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin and are privately placed, non-rated bonds without CUSIP numbers. The Company s methodology for pricing these securities focuses on three distinct inputs: equivalent rating, yield and other pricing terms. To determine the rating for a given non-rated investment debt security, the Investment Operations Department references a rated, publicly issued bond by the same issuer if available. A reduction is then applied to the rating obtained from the comparable bond, as the Company believes if liquidated, a non-rated bond would be valued less than a similar bond with a verifiable rating. The reduction applied by the Company is one complete rating grade (i.e. a AA rating for a comparable bond would be reduced to A for the Company s valuation). For bond issues without comparable bond proxies, a rating of BBB was assigned. In the third quarter of 2024, all of the ratings derived by the Investment Operations Department using the above process were BBB or better. The fair value measurement noted above is sensitive to the rating input, as a higher rating typically results in an increased valuation. The remaining pricing inputs used in the bond valuation are observable. Based on the rating determined in the above process, Investment Operations obtains a corresponding current market yield curve available to market participants. Other terms including coupon, maturity date, redemption price, number of coupon payments per year, and accrual method are obtained from the individual bond term sheets. Certain municipal bonds held by the Company at September 30, 2024 are continuously callable. When valuing these bonds, the fair value is capped at par value as the Company assumes a market participant would not pay more than par for a continuously callable bond. 
 
 Mortgage loans held-for-sale The fair value of mortgage loans held-for-sale is typically determined by reference to investor price sheets for loan products with similar characteristics. Loans measured with this valuation technique are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company classified million of certain delinquent mortgage loans held-for-sale as Level 3. For such delinquent loans in which investor interest may be limited, the Company estimates fair value by discounting future scheduled cash flows for the specific loan through its life, adjusted for estimated credit losses. The Company uses a discount rate based on prevailing market coupon rates on loans with similar characteristics. The assumed weighted average discount rate used as an input to value these loans at September 30, 2024 was . The higher the rate utilized to discount estimated future cash flows, the lower the fair value measurement. Additionally, the weighted average credit discount used as an input to value the specific loans was with credit loss discount ranging from - at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Loans held-for-investment The fair value for certain loans in which the Company previously elected the fair value option is estimated by discounting future scheduled cash flows for the specific loan through maturity, adjusted for estimated credit losses and prepayment or life assumptions. These loans primarily consist of early buyout loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are delinquent and, as a result, investor interest may be limited. The Company uses a discount rate based on the actual coupon rate of the underlying loan. At September 30, 2024, the Company classified million of loans held-for-investment carried at fair value as Level 3. The assumed weighted average discount rate used as an input to value these loans at September 30, 2024 was . The higher the rate utilized to discount estimated future cash flows, the lower the fair value measurement. As noted above, the fair value estimate also includes assumptions of prepayment speeds and average life as well as credit losses. The weighted average prepayments speed used as an input to value current loans was at September 30, 2024. Prepayment speeds are inversely related to the fair value of these loans as an increase in prepayment speeds results in a decreased valuation. For delinquent loans in which performance is not assumed and there is a higher probability of resolution of the loan ending in foreclosure, the weighted average life of such loans was years. Average life is inversely related to the fair value of these loans as an increase in estimated life results in a decreased valuation. Additionally, the weighted average credit discount used as an input to value the specific loans was with credit loss discounts ranging from - at September 30, 2024. 
 
 MSRs Fair value for MSRs is determined utilizing a valuation model which calculates the fair value of each servicing right based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The Company uses a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with each servicing right, given current market conditions. At September 30, 2024, the Company classified million of MSRs as Level 3. The weighted average discount rate used as an input to value the pool of MSRs at September 30, 2024 was with discount rates applied ranging from - . The higher the rate utilized to discount estimated future cash flows, the lower the fair value measurement. The fair value of MSRs was also estimated based on other assumptions including prepayment speeds and the cost to service. Prepayment speeds ranged from - or a weighted average prepayment speed of . Further, for current and delinquent loans, the Company assumed a weighted average cost of servicing of and , respectively, per loan. Prepayment speeds and the cost to service are both inversely related to the fair value of MSRs as an increase in prepayment speeds or the cost to service results in a decreased valuation. See Note (9) Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs in Item 1 of this report for further discussion of MSRs.

 million of derivative assets related to interest rate locks as Level 3. The fair value of interest rate locks is based on prices obtained for loans with similar characteristics from third parties, adjusted for the pull-through rate, which represents the Company s best estimate of the likelihood that a committed loan will ultimately fund. The weighted-average pull-through rate at September 30, 2024 was with pull-through rates applied ranging from to . Pull-through rates are directly related to the fair value of interest rate locks as an increase in the pull-through rate results in an increased valuation. 
 
 Nonqualified deferred compensation assets The underlying assets relating to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan are included in a trust and primarily consist of non-exchange traded institutional funds which are priced based by an independent third party service. These assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

 Individually assessed loans In accordance with ASC 326, the allowance for credit losses for loans and other financial assets held at amortized cost should be measured on a collective or pooled basis when such assets exhibit similar risk characteristics. In instances in which a financial asset does not exhibit similar risk characteristics to a pool, the Company is required to measure such allowance for credit losses on an individual asset basis. For the Company s loan portfolio, nonaccrual loans are considered to not exhibit similar risk characteristics as pools and thus are individually assessed. Credit losses are measured by estimating the fair value of the loan based on the present value of expected cash flows, the market price of the loan, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. Individually assessed loans are considered a fair value measurement where an allowance for credit loss is established based on the fair value of collateral. Appraised values on relevant real estate properties, which may require adjustments to market-based valuation inputs, are generally used on foreclosure probable and collateral-dependent loans within the real estate portfolios.

 million of individually assessed loans classified as Level 3. All of the million of individually assessed loans were measured at fair value based on the underlying collateral of the loan as shown in the table above. 
 
 Other real estate owned Other real estate owned is comprised of real estate acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loans and is included in other assets. Other real estate owned is recorded at its estimated fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of transfer, with any excess of the related loan balance over the fair value less expected selling costs charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent changes in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are recorded in other non-interest expense. Gains and losses upon sale, if any, are also charged to other non-interest expense. Fair value is generally based on third party appraisals and internal estimates that are adjusted by a discount representing the estimated cost of sale and is therefore considered a Level 3 valuation. 
 
 The Company s Managed Assets Division is primarily responsible for the valuation of Level 3 inputs for other real estate owned. At September 30, 2024, the Company had million of other real estate owned classified as Level 3. The unobservable input applied to other real estate owned relates to the reduction to the appraisal value representing the estimated cost of sale of the foreclosed property. A higher discount for the estimated cost of sale results in a decreased carrying value.

These include cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits with banks, brokerage customer receivables, FHLB and FRB stock, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable and non-maturity deposits. 
 
 The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments that were not previously disclosed. 
 
 Held-to-maturity securities. Held-to-maturity securities include U.S. government-sponsored agency securities, municipal bonds issued by various municipal government entities primarily located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin and mortgage-backed securities. Fair values for held-to-maturity securities are typically based on prices obtained from independent pricing vendors. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has generally categorized these held-to-maturity securities as a Level 2 fair value measurement. Fair values for certain other held-to-maturity securities are based on the bond pricing methodology discussed previously related to certain available-for-sale securities. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized these held-to-maturity securities as a Level 3 fair value measurement. 
 
 Loans held-for-investment, at amortized cost. Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are analyzed by type such as commercial, residential real estate, etc. Each category is further segmented by interest rate type (fixed and variable). The fair value for loans is estimated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect credit and interest rate risks inherent in the loan category. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized these loans as a Level 3 fair value measurement.

 ITEM 2 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition of Wintrust Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, Wintrust or the Company as of September 30, 2024 compared with December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, and the results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes contained in this report and the risk factors discussed under Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A, of this Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and, as such, future results could differ significantly from management s current expectations. See the last section of this discussion for further information on forward-looking statements. 
 
 Introduction 
 
 Wintrust is a financial holding company that provides traditional community and commercial banking services and offers a full array of wealth management services, primarily to customers in the Chicago metropolitan area, southern Wisconsin and northwest Indiana, and operates other financing businesses on a national basis and in Canada through several non-bank business units. 

Overview 

Third Quarter Highlights 
 
 The Company recorded net income of 170.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 164.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. The results for the third quarter of 2024 demonstrate the Company's ability to grow net interest income through both organic earning asset growth and growth through acquisitions. Partially offsetting the increase in net interest income was an increase in non-interest expense. The increase in non-interest expense was a result of additional expenses to support organic growth as well as the impact from the Macatawa acquisition. Comprehensive income includes 1) net income as presented on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income and 2) other comprehensive income or loss from unrealized gains and losses on the Company s available-for-sale investment securities portfolios and derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges as well as foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive income (loss) totaled 390.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a loss of 4.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 The Company increased its loan portfolio from 41.4 billion at September 30, 2023 and 42.1 billion at December 31, 2023 to 47.1 billion at September 30, 2024. The increase in the current period compared to the prior periods was a result of organic growth in several portfolios, including the commercial, commercial real estate, residential real estate loans held for investment portfolios, and property and casualty insurance premium finance receivable portfolios as well as 1.3 billion in loans acquired from Macatawa. For more information regarding changes in the Company s loan portfolio, see Financial Condition Interest Earning Assets and Note (6) Loans of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report. 
 
 The Company recorded net interest income of 502.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 462.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. This increase in net interest income recorded in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 resulted primarily from growth in earning assets, specifically a 5.2 billion increase in average loans. Net interest margin was 3.49 (3.51 on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.60 (3.62 on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease is primarily due to higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities, most notably interest-bearing deposits (see Net Interest Income for further detail). 
 
 Non-interest income totaled 113.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 112.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase is due to increased net gains on investment securities of 5.5 million, increased wealth management revenue of 3.7 million and an increase of service charges on deposits of 2.2 million which was offset by decreased mortgage banking revenue of 11.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 (see Non-Interest Income for further detail). 
 
 Non-interest expense totaled 360.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 30.6 million, or 9 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. This increase compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to increased salaries and employee benefits of 18.9 million and increased software and equipment expenses of 5.6 million. (see Non-Interest Expense for further detail).

 Management considers the maintenance of adequate liquidity to be important to the management of risk. Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company continued its practice of maintaining appropriate funding capacity to provide the Company with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations. In this regard, the Company benefited from its strong deposit base, a liquid short-term investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources. See Deposits and Other Funding Sources for additional information regarding liquidity sources.

 (1) See following section titled Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures/Ratios for additional information on this performance measure/ratio. 
 (2) Net revenue is net interest income plus non-interest income. 
 (3) The net overhead ratio is calculated by netting total non-interest expense and total non-interest income, annualizing this amount, and dividing by that period s total average assets. A lower ratio indicates a higher degree of efficiency. 
 
 Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, and quarterly growth rates are annualized throughout this report to represent an annual time period. This is done for analytical purposes to better discern for decision-making purposes underlying performance trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, balance sheet growth rates are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate. As such, 5 growth during a quarter would represent an annualized growth rate of 20 .

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES/RATIOS 
 
 The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company s performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), taxable-equivalent net interest margin (including its individual components), the taxable-equivalent efficiency ratio, tangible common equity ratio, tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity and pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses. Management believes that these measures and ratios provide users of the Company s financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the Company s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the Company s operating efficiency. Other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently. 
 
 Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent FTE basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis using tax rates effective as of the end of the period. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is also used in the calculation of the Company s efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue (less securities gains or losses), measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue. Securities gains or losses are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses. Management considers the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the Company s equity. The Company references the return on average tangible common equity as a measurement of profitability. Management considers pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses as a useful measurement of the Company s core net income.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The Company s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States, prevailing practices of the banking industry, and the application of accounting policies of which are described in Note (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Company s future financial condition and results of operations. At September 30, 2024, management views critical accounting estimates to include the determination of the allowance for credit losses, estimations of fair value, the valuations required for impairment testing of goodwill, the valuation and accounting for derivative instruments and income taxes as the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. These estimates were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses, including the Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Allowance for Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities 
 
 The allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of expected credit losses over the life of a financial asset carried at amortized cost. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the fair value of the underlying collateral and amount and timing of expected future cash flows on individually assessed financial assets, estimated credit losses on pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and consideration of reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic conditions, all of which are susceptible to significant change. At September 30, 2024, the loan and held-to-maturity debt securities portfolios represent 80 of the total assets on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. The Company also maintains an allowance for lending-related commitments, specifically unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, which relates to certain amounts the Company is committed to lend (not unconditionally cancelable) but for which funds have not yet been disbursed. 
 
 Key macroeconomic variable data points that are significant inputs into our credit loss models for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios are the Baa corporate credit spread as well as CREPI specifically related to the commercial real estate portfolio. Holding all other inputs constant, the table below shows the impact of changes in these key macroeconomic variable data points on the estimate of allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Impact to estimated allowance for credit losses from an increased or higher input value Baa Credit Spread Increases CRE Price Index Decreases 
 
 Holding all other inputs constant, the following table provides a sensitivity analysis for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios based on a 20 basis point change in Baa credit spreads from the assumption utilized in the estimate of that portfolio s allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024:

 Holding all other inputs constant, the following table provides a sensitivity analysis for the commercial real estate construction and non-construction portfolios based on a 10 change in CREPI from the assumption utilized in the estimate of that portfolio s allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024: 
 
 CRE Price Index Increases Decreases Commercial Real Estate: Construction Decreases estimate by 40 -45 Increases estimate by 105 -110 Non-Construction Decreases estimate by 30 -35 Increases estimate by 55 -60 
 
 See Note (7) Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report and the section titled Credit Quality in Item 2 of this report for a description of the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses.

Net Income 
 
 Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled 170.0 million, an increase of 5.8 million, or 4 , compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. On a per share basis, net income for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 2.47 per diluted common share compared to 2.53 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 The increase in net income for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily attributable to increased net interest income, partially offset by increased non-interest expense including the impact of the Macatawa acquisition. See Net Interest Income , Non-interest Income , Non-interest Expense and Credit Quality for further detail. 

Net Interest Income 
 
 The primary source of the Company s revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on the liabilities to fund those assets, including interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings. The amount of net interest income is affected by both changes in the level of interest rates, and the amount and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.

 Notable contributions to the change in non-interest income are as follows: 
 
 Wealth management revenue increased by 3.7 million and 10.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods of 2023, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase is primarily due to increased asset management fees as a result of higher assets under management when compared to same period in the prior year. 
 
 Mortgage banking revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to lower net revenue related to MSR activity and valuation adjustments. On a year-to-date basis, mortgage banking revenue decreased slightly for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of lower net revenue related to MSR activity which was offset by higher production revenue from increased mortgage production. Mortgage banking revenue includes revenue from activities related to originating, selling and servicing residential real estate loans for the secondary market. A main factor in the mortgage banking revenue recognized by the Company is the volume of mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale. Mortgage loans originated for sale totaled 766.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 572.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. On a year-to-date basis, mortgage loans originated for sale totaled 2.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in originations from the comparative three and nine month periods was driven by growth in both purchase and refinance originations as housing inventories have improved and interest rates pulled back from peak levels reached in 2023. The percentage of origination volume from refinancing activities was 28 and 22 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 16 and 17 , for the same periods in 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Company records MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of the MSRs portfolio decreased as a result of an unfavorable fair value adjustment of 17.3 million was recorded and a reduction in value of 7.3 million due to payoffs, paydowns and repurchases of the existing portfolio, partially offset as r etained servicing rights led to capitalization of 6.4 million. On a year-to-date basis, the fair value of MSRs decreased due to a unfavorable fair value adjustment of 8.9 million as well as a reduction in value of 17.2 million due to payoffs, paydowns and repurchases of the existing portfolio, partially offset by retained servicing rights led to capitalization of 20.0 million. See Note (9) Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report for a summary of the changes in the carrying value of MSRs.

 Mortgage banking revenue is also impacted by changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company s MSRs portfolio. The change in fair value of the derivative contracts held as an economic hedge was a favorable 6.9 million and 3.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Service charges on deposits increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily as a result of increased account analysis services fees. Service charges on deposit accounts include fees charged to deposit customers for various services, including account analysis services, and are based on factors such as the size and type of customer, type of product and number of transactions. The fees are based on a standard schedule of fees and, depending on the nature of the service performed, the service is performed at a point in time or over a period of a month. 
 
 The Company recognized net gains on investment securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 3.2 million and 233,000, respectively. The Company recognized net losses on investment securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 2.4 million and 1.0 million, respectively. The net gains for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to gains on the Company s equity investment securities recorded in the third quarter of 2024. See Note (5) Investment Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report for more information on net gains and losses on investment securities. 
 
 Fees from covered call options for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3.2 million and 9.3 million, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The decreased income was primarily because the Company sold less options than the prior year for both comparative periods. The Company has typically written call options with terms of less than three months against certain U.S. Treasury and agency securities held in its portfolio for liquidity and other purposes. Management has effectively entered into these transactions with the goal of economically hedging security positions and enhancing its overall return on its investment portfolio. These option transactions are designed to increase the total return associated with holding certain investment securities and do not qualify as hedges pursuant to accounting guidance. There were no outstanding call option contracts at September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Miscellaneous non-interest income includes loan servicing fees, income from other investments, and other fees. This category of income increased 277,000 and 30.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, miscellaneous income increased compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due higher fee income earned on card-related arrangements and partnership income. The increased income on a year-to-date basis was primarily due to a 20.0 million gain recognized in the first quarter of 2024 related to the sale of the Company s Retirement Benefits Advisors RBA") division within its wealth management business as well as a 4.6 million gain recognized in the second quarter of 2024 on the sale of premium finance receivables.

 Notable contributions to the change in non-interest expense are as follows: 
 Salaries and employee benefits expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was primarily due to elevated commissions from increased mortgage production as well as due to the increase in employees related to the growth of the Company, including the Macatawa acquisition. 
 Software and equipment expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 as a result of higher software license fees as well as higher computer and software depreciation expense as the Company invests in enhancements to the digital customer experience, upgrades to infrastructure and enhancements to information security capabilities. 
 Amortization of other acquisition-related intangible assets increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The Macatawa acquisition impacted this increase by approximately 3.0 million. 
 FDIC insurance expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. On a year-to-date basis, the increase is primarily due to the Company s recognition of approximately 5.2 million accrued in the first quarter of 2024 as a result of the FDIC special assessment on uninsured deposits in response to certain bank failures that occurred in 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increased expense is primarily due to balance sheet growth as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Miscellaneous expense includes ATM expenses, correspondent bank charges, directors fees, telephone, postage, corporate insurance, dues and subscriptions, problem loan expenses and other miscellaneous operational losses and costs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the company incurred 1.6 million and 2.5 million, respectively, in acquisition expenses related to the acquisition of Macatawa. 

Income Taxes 
 
 The Company recorded income tax expense of 62.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 60.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rates were 26.95 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 26.98 in the third quarter of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of 184.3 million compared to 180.7 million for the first nine months of 2023. The effective tax rates were 26.56 for the first nine months of 2024 and 26.58 for the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 The effective tax rates were partially impacted by the tax effects related to share-based compensation which fluctuate based on the Company s stock price and timing of employee stock option exercises and vesting of other shared-based awards. The Company recorded net excess tax benefits of 4.4 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to net excess tax benefits of 2.9 million in the first nine months of 2023 related to share-based compensation, most of which was recorded in the first quarter for each year. 

Operating Segment Results 
 
 The Company s operations consist of three primary segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management. Refer to Note (13) Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report for further information on the Company s primary segments. The Company s profitability is primarily dependent on the net interest income, provision for credit losses, non-interest income and operating expenses of its community banking segment. 
 
 The community banking segment s net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled 396.9 million as compared to 360.6 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 36.3 million, or 10 . On a year-to-date basis, net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 1.1 billion. The increase in the third quarter of 2024, was primarily attributable to increased interest and fees on loans . The community banking segment s non-interest income totaled 66.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, an decrease of 4.2 million , or 6 , when compared to the third quarter of 2023 total of 70.5 million . On a year-to-date basis, non-interest income totaled 212.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , an increase of 5.2 million , or 2 , compared to 207.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the nine month period was primarily the result of gains on investment securities and increased service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by decreased mortgage banking revenue due to the decrease in the fair value of MSRs related to the changes in fair value model assumptions. The community banking segment recorded provision for credit losses of 20.5 million and 77.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.7 million and 64.6 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The increase in provision for credit losses for the three and nine month period was primarily the result of loan growth, including 15.5 million in Day 1 provision related to the acquisition of Macatawa, coupled with losses experienced in the Commercial and Commercial Real

 Estate portfolios. The community banking segment s net income for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 totaled 115.2 million. On a year-to-date basis, the net income of the community banking segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 326.5 million as compared to 351.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The specialty finance segment s net interest income totaled 88.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 85.4 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 3.0 million, or 4 . On a year-to-date basis, net interest income for the segment increased 25.2 million, or 10 , compared to the same period in 2023. The increase for the three and nine month period was primarily due to loan growth and increased interest rates on the premium finance receivables portfolios. The specialty finance segment s non-interest income increased to 29.6 million from 20.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and stood at 89.2 million and 78.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our property and casualty insurance premium finance operations, life insurance finance operations, lease financing operations and accounts receivable finance operations accounted for 51 , 29 , 18 and 2 , respectively, of the net revenues of our specialty finance business for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. The net income of the specialty finance segment for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled 46.8 million as compared to 40.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. On a year-to-date basis, the net income of the specialty finance segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 142.4 million as compared to 123.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The wealth management segment reported net interest income of 6.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 8.0 million in the same quarter of 2023, a decrease of 1.1 million, or 13 . On a year-to-date basis, net interest income totaled 22.6 million for the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 24.4 million for the first nine months of 2023. Net interest income for this segment is primarily comprised of an allocation of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks. Wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks averaged 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. This segment recorded non-interest income of 37.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 37.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. On a year-to-date basis, this segment recorded non-interest income of 131.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 101.0 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 20.0 million gain recognized in the first quarter of 2024 related to the sale of the Company s RBA division within the wealth management business. Distribution of wealth management services through each bank continues to be a focus of the Company. The Company is committed to growing the wealth management segment in order to better service its customers and create a more diversified revenue stream. The wealth management segment s net income totaled 8.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 8.5 million for the third quarter of 2023.

 (2) Liquidity management assets include investment securities, other securities, interest earning deposits with banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. 
 (3) Other earning assets include brokerage customer receivables and trading account securities. 
 
 Mortgage loans held-for-sale. Mortgage loans held-for-sale represents such loans awaiting subsequent sale in the secondary market with such sales eliminating the interest-rate risk associated with these loans, as they are predominantly long-term fixed rate loans, and provide a source of non-interest revenue. The increase in average balance for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the sequential and prior year periods is primarily due to higher mortgage origination production. 
 
 Loans, net of unearned income. Growth realized in the combined commercial and commercial real estate loan categories for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the sequential and prior year periods is primarily attributable to increased business development efforts as well as loans acquired through the Macatawa acquisition. The aggregate balances of these loan categories comprised 59 , 58 and 57 of the average loan portfolio in the third quarter of 2024, second quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023, respectively. 
 
 Residential real estate loans averaged 3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024, and increased 614.1 million, or 24 , from the average balance of 2.6 billion in the same period of 2023. Additionally, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the average balance increased 277.3 million, or 38 on an annualized basis. Growth is due to the Company continuing to allocate a portion of its mortgage production for investment instead of for subsequent sale into the secondary market. 
 
 The increase in the premium finance receivables during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was the result of continued originations within the portfolio due to hardening insurance market conditions driving a higher average size of new property and casualty insurance premium finance receivables as well as effective marketing and customer servicing. Approximately 4.8 billion of premium finance receivables were originated in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 4.6 billion during the same period of 2023. Premium finance receivables consist of a property and casualty portfolio and a life portfolio comprising approximately 47 and 53 , respectively, of the average total balance of premium finance receivables for the third quarter of 2024, and 46 and 54 , respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Other loans represent a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk due to the type and nature of the collateral.

 Liquidity management assets. Funds that are not utilized for loan originations are used to purchase investment securities and short term money market investments, to sell as federal funds and to maintain in interest bearing deposits with banks. The balances of these assets can fluctuate based on management s ongoing effort to manage liquidity and for asset liability management purposes. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate and utilize liquidity sources as needed, including the management of availability with the FHLB and FRB and utilization of the revolving credit facility with unaffiliated banks.

 We make commercial loans for many purposes, including working capital lines, which are generally renewable annually and supported by business assets, personal guarantees and additional collateral. Such loans may vary in size based on customer need. Primarily as a result of growth in the Company s commercial loan portfolio our allowance for credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio increased to 171.6 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 151.5 million as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first mortgage lien and assignment of rents on the property. Since most of our bank branches are located in the Chicago metropolitan area, southern Wisconsin and west Michigan, 69.4 of our commercial real estate loan portfolio is located in this region as of September 30, 2024. We have been able to effectively manage our total non-performing commercial real estate loans, aided by our credit management process. As of September 30, 2024, our allowance for credit losses related to this portfolio was 231.1 million compared to 215.7 million as of September 30, 2023 . The increase in the allowance for credit losses is primarily a result of growth in our commercial real estate portfolio. The table below sets forth the commercial real estate loans by property type and owner vs. non-owner occupied.

 The Company also participates in mortgage warehouse lending, which is included above within commercial, industrial and other, by providing interim funding to unaffiliated mortgage bankers to finance residential mortgages originated by such bankers for sale into the secondary market. The Company s loans to the mortgage bankers are secured by the business assets of the mortgage companies as well as the specific mortgage loans funded by the Company, after they have been pre-approved for purchase by third party end lenders. The Company may also provide interim financing for packages of mortgage loans on a bulk basis in circumstances where the mortgage bankers desire to competitively bid on a number of mortgages for sale as a package in the secondary market. 

Past Due Loans and Non-Performing Assets 
 
 Our ability to manage credit risk depends in large part on our ability to properly identify and manage problem loans. To do so, the Company operates a credit risk rating system under which our credit management personnel assigns a credit risk rating to each loan at the time of origination and review loans on a regular basis to determine each loan s credit risk rating on a scale of 1 through 10 with higher scores indicating higher risk. Description of the Company s credit risk rating structure used is included in Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 If based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due to it according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, a loan is individually assessed for measuring the allowance for credit losses and, if necessary, a reserve is established. In determining the appropriate reserve for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral. 

Loan Portfolio Aging 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, excluding early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, 83.1 million, or 0.2 of all loans, were 60 to 89 days (or two payments) past due and 204.0 million, or 0.4 of all loans, were 30 to 59 days (or one payment) past due. As of June 30, 2024, excluding early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, 59.4 million, or 0.1 of all loans, were 60 to 89 days (or two payments) past due and 139.8 million, or 0.3 of all loans, were 30 to 59 days (or one payment) past due. Many of the commercial and commercial real estate loans shown as 60 to 89 days and 30 to 59 days past due are included on the Company s internal problem loan reporting system. Loans on this system are closely monitored by management on a monthly basis. The Company's home equity and residential loan portfolios continue to exhibit low delinquency ratios. Home equity loans at September 30, 2024 that were current with regard to the contractual terms of the loan agreement represent 98.9 of the total home equity portfolio. Residential real estate loans, excluding early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, at September 30, 2024 that were current with regards to the contractual terms of the loan agreements comprise 99.2 of total residential real estate loans outstanding. For more information regarding delinquent loans as of September 30, 2024, see Note (7) Allowance for Credit Losses in Item 1 of this report.

 (1) Excludes early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Early buy-out loans are insured or guaranteed by the FHA or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, subject to indemnifications and insurance limits for certain loans. 

At this time, management believes reserves are appropriate to absorb losses that are expected upon the ultimate resolution of these credits. Significant increases may occur in subsequent periods due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and related impacts on borrowers. Management will continue to actively review and monitor its loan portfolios, in an effort to identify problem credits in a timely manner.

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The allowance for credit losses, specifically the allowance for loans losses and the allowance for unfunded commitment losses, represents management s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is determined quarterly using a methodology that incorporates important risk characteristics of each loan. A description of how the Company determines the allowance for credit losses is included in Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Management determined that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at September 30, 2024, and that the loan portfolio is well diversified and well secured, without undue concentration in any specific risk area. While this process involves a high degree of management judgment, the allowance for credit losses is based on a comprehensive, well documented, and consistently applied analysis of the Company s loan portfolio. This analysis takes into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as economic, industry, geographical and political factors, when considered applicable. The relative level of allowance for credit losses is reviewed and compared to industry peers. This review encompasses levels of total non-performing loans, portfolio mix, portfolio concentrations and overall levels of net charge-off. Historical trending of both the Company s results and the industry peers is also reviewed to analyze comparative significance.

 Other Real Estate Owned 
 
 In certain circumstances, the Company is required to take action against the real estate collateral of specific loans. The Company uses foreclosure only as a last resort for dealing with borrowers experiencing financial hardships. The Company employs extensive contact and restructuring procedures to attempt to find other solutions for our borrowers. The tables below present a summary of other real estate owned and show the activity for the respective periods and the balance for each property type:

 The following table sets forth, by category, the composition of average deposit balances and the relative percentage of total average deposits for the periods presented: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Balance Percent Balance Percent Balance Percent Non-interest-bearing 10,271,613 21 9,879,134 21 10,612,009 25 NOW and interest-bearing demand deposits 5,174,673 11 4,985,306 11 5,815,155 13 Wealth management deposits 1,362,747 3 1,531,865 3 1,512,765 3 Money market 16,436,111 34 15,272,126 33 14,155,446 32 Savings 6,096,746 12 5,878,844 13 5,472,535 12 Time certificates of deposit 9,598,109 19 8,546,172 19 6,495,906 15 Total average deposits 48,939,999 100 46,093,447 100 44,063,816 100 
 
 Total average deposits for the third quarter of 2024 were 48.9 billion, an increase of 4.9 billion, or 11 , from the third quarter of 2023. Total deposits increased in the third quarter primarily as a result of the Macatawa acquisition as well as the Company s increased marketing efforts to retain and attract deposits to support continued loan growth. Additionally, the diversity of our deposit base showed its resilience in a volatile market. The Company has experienced a change in the mix of deposits as non-interest bearing deposits have migrated to interest-bearing products. 
 
 Wealth management deposits are funds from the brokerage customers of Wintrust Investments, CDEC and trust and asset management customers of the Company which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks wealth management deposits in the table above). Wealth Management deposits consist primarily of money market accounts. Consistent with reasonable interest rate risk parameters, these funds have generally been invested in loan production of the banks as well as other investments suitable for banks. 
 
 Brokered Deposits 
 
 While the Company obtains a portion of its total deposits through brokered deposits, the Company does so primarily as an asset-liability management tool to assist in the management of interest rate risk, and the Company does not consider brokered deposits to be a vital component of its current liquidity resources. Historically, brokered deposits have represented a small component of the Company s total deposits outstanding, as set forth in the table below: 
 September 30, December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2023 2022 2021 Total deposits 51,404,966 44,992,686 45,397,170 42,902,544 42,095,585 Brokered deposits 4,080,401 3,693,997 4,216,718 3,174,093 1,591,083 Brokered deposits as a percentage of total deposits 7.9 8.2 9.3 7.4 3.8 
 
 Brokered deposits include certificates of deposit obtained through deposit brokers, deposits received through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Program, and certain deposits of brokerage customers from unaffiliated companies which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks. 

Other Funding Sources 
 
 Although deposits are the Company s primary source of funding its interest-earning assets, the Company s ability to manage the types and terms of deposits is somewhat limited by customer preferences and market competition. As a result, in addition to deposits and the issuance of equity securities and the retention of earnings, the Company uses several other funding sources to support its growth. These sources include FHLB advances, notes payable, short-term borrowings, secured borrowings, subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures. The Company evaluates the terms and unique characteristics of each source, as well as its asset-liability management position, in determining the use of such funding sources.

Shareholders Equity 
 
 The following tables reflect various consolidated measures of capital as of the dates presented and the capital guidelines established for a bank holding company:

 (1) Reflects the Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5 . 
 (2) Reflects the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Company for purposes of the Federal Reserve s Regulation Y. The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies BHCs to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the U.S. Basel III Rule or to add Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio requirements to this standard. As a result, the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio are denoted as N/A in this column. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to BHCs as the standard applicable to our subsidiary banks, we believe the Company s capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard.

The Company s principal sources of funds at the holding company level are dividends from its subsidiaries, borrowings under its loan agreement with unaffiliated banks and proceeds from the issuances of subordinated debt and additional equity. Refer to Notes (11) and (12) of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 for further information on these various funding sources. See Note (23) Shareholders Equity of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 7 of the 2023 Form 10-K for details on the Company s issuance of Series D Preferred Stock in June 2015, Series E Preferred Stock and associated Depositary Shares in May 2020 and additional common stock offering in June 2022. 
 
 The Board of Directors approves dividends from time to time, however, the ability to declare a dividend is limited by the Company s financial condition, the terms of the Company s Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, the terms of the Company s Trust Preferred Securities offerings and under certain financial covenants in the Company s revolving and term facilities. In January, April and July of 2024, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.45 per common share. In January, April, July and October of 2023, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.40 per common share. 
 
 The Company continues to leverage its capital management framework to assess and monitor risk when making capital decisions. Management is committed to maintaining the Company s capital levels above the Well Capitalized levels established by the FRB for bank holding companies. 

LIQUIDITY 
 
 The Company manages the liquidity position of its banking operations to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet customers needs for loans and deposit withdrawals. The management process includes the utilization of stress testing processes and other aspects of the Company's liquidity management framework to assess and monitor risk, and inform decision making. The liquidity to meet the demands of customers is provided by maturing assets, liquid assets that can be converted to cash and the ability to attract funds from external sources. Liquid assets refer to money market assets such as Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks, as well as available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are not pledged to secure public funds. In addition, trade date receivables represent certain sales or calls of available-for-sale securities that await cash settlement, typically in the month following the trade date. 
 
 In addition to the liquidity management noted above, in the second quarter of 2024, the Company completed a loan sale transaction within our property and casualty insurance premium finance receivables portfolio which demonstrated that our premium finance portfolio is a strong source of additional liquidity if needed and demonstrated the flexibility to continue to manage our balance sheet effectively. Net proceeds to the Company totaled approximately 627.5 million and a gain on the sale was recorded for approximately 4.6 million. We maintain our liquid assets to ensure that we would have the balance sheet strength to serve our clients. As a result, the Company believes that it has sufficient funds and access to funds to effectively meet its working capital and other needs. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate liquidity sources, including the management of availability with the FHLB and FRB and utilization of the revolving credit facility with unaffiliated banks. Please refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Interest-Earning Assets, -Deposits, -Other Funding Sources and -Shareholders Equity sections of this report for additional information regarding the Company s liquidity position. 

INFLATION 
 
 A banking organization s assets and liabilities are primarily monetary. Changes in the rate of inflation typically do not have as great an impact on the financial condition of a bank as do changes in interest rates. Moreover, interest rates do not necessarily change at the same percentage as inflation. Accordingly, changes in inflation are not expected to have as material an impact on the Company s business as entities operating in other industries. An analysis of the Company s asset and liability structure provides the best indication of how the organization is positioned to respond to changing interest rates. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section of this report for additional information.

ITEM 3 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 As an ongoing part of its financial strategy, the Company attempts to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. This effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and maintenance of yield. Asset-liability management policies are established and monitored by management in conjunction with the boards of directors of the banks, subject to general oversight by the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The policies establish guidelines for acceptable limits on the sensitivity of the market value of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. 
 
 Interest rate risk arises when the maturity or re-pricing periods and interest rate indices of the interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, and derivative financial instruments are different. It is the risk that changes in the level of market interest rates will result in disproportionate changes in the value of, and the net earnings generated from, the Company s interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments. The Company continuously monitors not only the organization s current net interest margin, but also the historical trends of these margins. In addition, management attempts to identify potential adverse changes in net interest income in future years as a result of interest rate fluctuations by performing simulation analysis of various interest rate environments. If a potential adverse change in net interest margin and/or net income is identified, management would take appropriate actions with its asset-liability structure to mitigate these potentially adverse situations.

 Since the Company s primary source of interest-bearing liabilities is from customer deposits, the Company s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits is somewhat limited by customer preferences and local competition in the market areas in which the banks operate. The rates, terms and interest rate indices of the Company s interest-earning assets result primarily from the Company s strategy of investing in loans and securities that permit the Company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk, together with credit risk, while at the same time achieving an acceptable interest rate spread. 
 
 The Company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a regular basis by management and the Risk Management Committees of the boards of directors of the banks and the Company. The objective of the review is to measure the effect on net income and to adjust balance sheet and derivative financial instruments to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing net interest income. 
 
 The following interest rate scenarios display the percentage change in net interest income over a one-year time horizon assuming increases and decreases of 100 and 200 basis points. The Static Shock Scenario results incorporate actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet instruments following an instantaneous, parallel change in market rates based upon a static (i.e. no growth or constant) balance sheet. Conversely, the Ramp Scenario results incorporate management s projections of future volume and pricing of each of the product lines following a gradual, parallel change in market rates over twelve months. Actual results may differ from these simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies. The interest rate sensitivity for both the Static Shock and Ramp Scenarios at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 is as follows: 
 Static Shock Scenarios +200 Basis Points +100 Basis Points -100 Basis Points -200 Basis Points September 30, 2024 1.2 1.1 0.4 (0.9) June 30, 2024 1.5 1.0 0.6 (0.0) September 30, 2023 3.3 1.9 (2.0) (5.2) 
 
 Ramp Scenarios +200 Basis Points +100 Basis Points -100 Basis Points -200 Basis Points September 30, 2024 1.6 1.2 0.7 0.5 June 30, 2024 1.2 1.0 0.9 1.0 September 30, 2023 1.7 1.2 (0.5) (2.4) 
 
 One method utilized by financial institutions, including the Company, to manage interest rate risk is to enter into derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments include interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, floors and collars, futures, forwards, option contracts and other financial instruments with similar characteristics. Additionally, the Company enters into commitments to fund certain mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors. See Note (14) Derivative Financial Instruments of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report for further information on the Company s derivative financial instruments. 
 
 As shown above, the magnitude of potential changes in net interest income in various interest rate scenarios has continued to remain relatively neutral. Given the recent unprecedented rise in interest rates, the Company has made a conscious effort to reposition its exposure to changing interest rates given the uncertainty of the future interest rate environment. To this end, management has executed various derivative instruments including collars and receive fixed swaps to hedge variable rate loan exposures and originated a higher percentage of its loan originations in longer term fixed rate loans. The Company will continue to monitor current and projected interest rates and expects to execute additional derivatives to mitigate potential fluctuations in net interest margin in future periods. 

Periodically, the Company enters into certain covered call option transactions related to certain securities held by the Company. The Company uses these option transactions (rather than entering into other derivative interest rate contracts, such as interest rate floors) to economically hedge positions and compensate for net interest margin compression by increasing the total return associated with the related securities through fees generated from these options. Although the revenue received from these options is recorded as non-interest income rather than interest income, the increased return attributable to the related securities from these options contributes to the Company s overall profitability. The Company s exposure to interest rate risk may be impacted by these transactions. To further mitigate this risk, the Company may acquire fixed rate term debt or use financial derivative instruments. There were no covered call options outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. See

ITEM 4 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based upon, and as of the date of that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in ensuring the information relating to the Company (and its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner. 
 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the period that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II 

Item 1: Legal Proceedings 
 
 In accordance with applicable accounting principles, the Company establishes an accrued liability for litigation and threatened litigation actions and proceedings when those actions present loss contingencies, which are both probable and estimable. In actions for which a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, the Company determines whether it can estimate a loss or range of possible loss. To determine whether a possible loss is estimable, the Company reviews and evaluates its material litigation on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. This review may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on substantive or dispositive motions, and settlement discussions. 
 
 Wintrust Mortgage California PAGA Matter 
 
 On May 24, 2022, a former Wintrust Mortgage employee filed a California Private Attorney General Act PAGA suit, not individually, but as representative of all Wintrust Mortgage s California hourly employees, against Wintrust Mortgage in the Superior Court of San Diego County, California. Plaintiff alleges Wintrust Mortgage failed to provide: (i) accurate sick leave accrual and pay; (ii) overtime wages; (iii) accurately itemized wage statements; (iv) meal breaks and meal premiums; (v) timely payment of earned wages; (vi) payment of all earned wages; and (vii) payment of all vested vacation hours. Wintrust Mortgage disputes the validity of Plaintiff s claims and believes, to the extent there were defects in complying with California law governing the payment of compensation to Plaintiff, such errors would have been de minimis. Plaintiff also has an arbitration agreement with a collective and class action waiver and on January 19, 2023, Wintrust Mortgage moved to compel arbitration. The court stayed litigation pending mediation, which was held on May 13, 2024. The parties agreed to settle the dispute for an immaterial amount. On October 16, 2024, the court entered an order approving the settlement. 
 
 Wintrust Mortgage Fair Lending Matter 
 
 On May 25, 2022, a Wintrust Mortgage customer filed a putative class action and asserted individual claims against Wintrust Mortgage and Wintrust Financial Corporation in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Plaintiff alleges that Wintrust Mortgage discriminated against black/African American borrowers and brings class claims under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Sections 1981 and 1982 under Chapter 42 of the United States Code; and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Plaintiff also asserts individual claims under theories of promissory estoppel, fraudulent inducement, and breach of contract. On September 23, 2022, Wintrust filed a motion to dismiss the entire suit and the court granted that motion to dismiss on September 27, 2023 and gave Plaintiff until October 20, 2023 to file an amended complaint. Plaintiff timely filed an amended complaint. Wintrust moved to dismiss the amended complaint on November 21, 2023. Wintrust vigorously disputes these allegations, believing them to be legally and factually meritless, and Wintrust otherwise lacks sufficient information to estimate the amount of any potential liability.

 Wintrust Financial ERISA Matter 
 
 On July 29, 2022, a former Wintrust employee filed a class action in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois asserting claims under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA against Wintrust Financial Corporation. Plaintiff alleges Wintrust breached its fiduciary duty in the selection of BlackRock Target Date funds for inclusion in its 401(k) plan, that Wintrust failed to monitor the performance of those funds, and in the alternative, Wintrust should be liable for breach of trust. Plaintiff s sole basis for the allegations is that BlackRock Target Date funds allegedly performed more poorly than two comparable funds over a three-year period. Wintrust is one of several public companies that were sued on identical grounds within the same week by the same plaintiff s law firm. On November 8, 2022, Wintrust filed a motion to dismiss the entire complaint. On July 14, 2023, the District Court granted Wintrust s motion to dismiss and gave Plaintiff until August 2, 2023 to file an amended complaint. Plaintiff timely filed an amended complaint which Wintrust moved to dismiss on September 14, 2023. On August 14, 2024, the district court granted Wintrust s motion with prejudice. On September 9, 2024, Plaintiff timely appealed to the Seventh Circuit. Plaintiff s opening brief is due on December 18, 2024 and Wintrust s response brief is due on January 31, 2025. We continue to believe that plaintiff s allegations continue to be legally and factually meritless, that the district court correctly dismissed the amended complaint, and otherwise lack sufficient information to estimate the amount of any potential liability. 
 
 Other Matters 
 
 In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries, from time to time, are subject to pending and threatened legal action and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 Based on information currently available and upon consultation with counsel, management believes that the eventual outcome of any pending or threatened legal actions and proceedings described above, including our ordinary course litigation, will not have a material adverse effect on the operations or financial condition of the Company. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations or financial condition for a particular period. 

Item 1A: Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 No purchases of the Company s common shares were made by or on behalf of the Company or any affiliated purchaser as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 5: Other Information 
 
 Securities Trading Plans of Directors and Officers 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , none of our directors or officers or a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K).
