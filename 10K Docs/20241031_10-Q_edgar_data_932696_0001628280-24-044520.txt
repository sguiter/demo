 Our offerings in North America and certain countries in EMEA and APAC include hardware, software and services, including cloud solutions. Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA and APAC segments consist largely of software and certain software-related services and cloud solutions. 
 In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position as of September 30, 2024 and our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet at such date. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and consequently do not include all of the disclosures normally required by United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). 
 The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year, due in part to the seasonal nature of our business. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, including the related notes thereto, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Insight Enterprises, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales recognition, anticipated achievement levels under partner funding programs, assumptions related to stock-based compensation valuation, allowances for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventories, litigation-related obligations, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including intangible assets and goodwill and impairment of long-lived assets, including purchased intangibles and goodwill, if indicators of potential impairment exist.

 Senior unsecured notes due 2032 Convertible senior notes due 2025 Finance leases and other financing obligations Total Less: current portion of long-term debt ) ) Long-term debt 
 On May 14, 2024, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (as amended, the "credit agreement") to modify our senior secured revolving credit facility (the ABL facility ). The amendment, among other things, releases certain immaterial guarantors from their obligations under the credit agreement. Our maximum borrowing amount under the ABL facility is , including a maximum borrowing capacity that could be used for borrowing in certain foreign currencies of . From time to time and at our option, we may request to increase the aggregate amount available for borrowing under the ABL facility by up to an aggregate of the U.S. dollar equivalent of , subject to customary conditions, including receipt of commitments from lenders. The ABL facility is guaranteed by certain of our material subsidiaries and is secured by a lien on certain of our assets and certain of each other borrower s and each guarantor s assets. The ABL facility provides for an uncommitted first-in, last-out revolving facility in an aggregate amount of up to . The interest rates applicable to borrowings under the ABL facility are based on the average aggregate excess availability under the ABL facility as set forth on a pricing grid in the credit agreement. The ABL facility matures on July 22, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, eligible accounts receivable and inventory permitted availability to the full facility amount, of which was outstanding. 
 The ABL facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. If a default occurs (subject to customary grace periods and materiality thresholds) under the credit agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments and required payment of all outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and fees payable under the credit agreement. 
 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2032 
 On May 20, 2024, we issued aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2032 (the "Senior Notes") that mature on May 15, 2032. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and guaranteed by each of the Company's existing and future direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries that is or becomes a guarantor or borrower under the ABL facility, subject to certain exceptions. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the ABL facility. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Senior Notes Indenture") containing certain covenants that limit the Company's ability to, subject to certain exceptions, create, incur, or assume liens to secure debt, among other things. The Senior Notes bear interest at an annual rate of payable semiannually, in arrears, on May 15 th and November 15 th of each year beginning on November 15, 2024.

 of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are subject to redemption at specified prices on or after May 15, 2027 plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to May 15, 2027, the Company may, on one or more occasions, redeem the Senior Notes in whole or in part, at its option, upon notice, at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of such notes plus a make-whole premium as specified in the Senior Notes Indenture and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
 
 If the Company experiences certain change of control events, together with a ratings decline, as described in the Senior Notes Indenture, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase some or all of the Senior Notes at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. 
 
 The Senior Notes are subject to certain customary events of default and acceleration clauses. As of September 30, 2024, no such events have occurred. 
 Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 
 In August 2019, we issued aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes (the "Convertible Notes") that mature on February 15, 2025. The Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of payable semiannually, in arrears, on February 15 th and August 15 th of each year. The Convertible Notes are general unsecured obligations of Insight and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Insight Direct USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Insight. 
 
 Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 15, 2024, holders of the Convertible Notes could have converted their notes at their option at any time under certain circumstances. Beginning June 15, 2024 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the holders may convert their Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of such circumstances. 
 The Convertible Notes mature on February 15, 2025, and we are required to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash. As such, the Convertible Notes balance net of unamortized debt issuance costs is classified as a current liability. 
 Upon conversion, we will pay cash equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes, plus shares of our common stock for any additional amounts due. The conversion rate will initially be shares of common stock per principal amount of the Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to change in certain circumstances and will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain events that occur prior to the maturity date or following our issuance of a notice of redemption, the conversion rate is subject to an increase for a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection with those events or during the related redemption period in certain circumstances. 
 If we undergo a fundamental change, the holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.

 Interest expense resulting from the Convertible Notes reported within the consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is made up of contractual coupon interest and amortization of debt issuance costs. 
 Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transaction 
 In connection and concurrent with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into the Call Spread Transactions with respect to the Company s common stock. 
 The convertible note hedge consists of an option to purchase up to common stock shares at a price of per share. The hedge expires on February 15, 2025 and can only be concurrently executed upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes. We paid approximately for the convertible note hedge transaction. 
 Additionally, we sold warrants to purchase shares of common stock at a price of per share. The warrants expire on May 15, 2025 and can only be exercised at maturity. The Company received aggregate proceeds of approximately for the sale of the warrants. 
 The Call Spread Transactions have no effect on the terms of the Convertible Notes and reduce potential dilution by effectively increasing the initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes to per share of the Company s common stock.

In the future, if recognized, the remaining liability associated with uncertain tax positions could affect our effective tax rate. We do not believe there will be any changes to our unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months that would have a material effect on our effective tax rate. 
 We are currently under audit in various jurisdictions for tax years 2017 through 2022. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the examination phase of these audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. However, based on the status of the various examinations in multiple jurisdictions, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made at this time, but the estimated effect on our income tax expense and net earnings is not expected to be significant.

 Employment Contracts and Severance Plans 
 We have employment contracts with, and severance plans covering, certain officers and management teammates under which severance payments would become payable in the event of specified terminations without cause or terminations under certain circumstances after a change in control. In addition, vesting of outstanding nonvested RSUs would accelerate following a change in control. If severance payments under the current employment agreements or plan payments were to become payable, the severance payments would generally range from three to of salary. 
 Indemnifications 
 From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to indemnify either our clients or third-party service providers from certain losses incurred relating to services performed on our behalf or for losses arising from defined events, which may include litigation or claims relating to past performance. These arrangements include, but are not limited to, the indemnification of our clients for certain claims arising out of our performance under our sales contracts, the indemnification of our landlords for certain claims arising from our use of leased facilities and the indemnification of the lenders that provide our credit facilities for certain claims arising from their extension of credit to us. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. 
 Management believes that payments, if any, related to these indemnifications are not probable at September 30, 2024. Accordingly, we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our consolidated financial statements. 
 We have entered into separate indemnification agreements with certain of our executive officers and with each of our directors. These agreements require us, among other requirements, to indemnify such officers and directors against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments and settlements incurred by such individual in connection with any action arising out of such individual s status or service as our executive officer or director (subject to exceptions such as where the individual failed to act in good faith or in a manner the individual reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company) and to advance expenses incurred by such individual with respect to which such individual may be entitled to indemnification by us. There are no pending legal proceedings that involve the indemnification of any of the Company s directors or officers. 
 Contingencies Related to Third-Party Review 
 From time to time, we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties. We are also subject to various governmental, client and partner audits. We continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual. Where appropriate, we accrue estimates of anticipated liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are party to various legal proceedings incidental to the business, including preference payment claims asserted in client bankruptcy proceedings, indemnification claims, claims of alleged infringement of patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, employment claims, claims related to services provided, interruptions, or outages, claims of alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations.

 All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated upon consolidation, and there are no differences between the accounting policies used to measure profit and loss for our segments or on a consolidated basis. Net sales are defined as net sales to external clients. None of our clients exceeded ten percent of consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 A portion of our operating segments selling and administrative expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to them in order to realize economies of scale and to use resources efficiently. These expenses, collectively identified as corporate charges, include senior management expenses, internal audit, legal, tax, insurance services, treasury and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Charges are allocated to our operating segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the operating segments.

 Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price as shown in the table above was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a net adjustment of was recorded to reduce goodwill, primarily due to certain measurement period adjustments to accounts receivable, contract assets, net, accounts payable and accrued expenses.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We refer to our customers as clients, our suppliers as partners and our employees as teammates. 
 
 Quarterly Overview 
 Today, every business is a technology business. We help our clients accelerate their digital journey to modernize their businesses and maximize the value of technology. We serve these clients in North America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa EMEA and Asia-Pacific APAC ). As a Fortune 500-ranked solutions integrator, we enable secure, end-to-end digital transformation and meet the needs of our clients through a comprehensive portfolio of solutions, far-reaching partnerships and 36 years of broad IT expertise. We amplify our solutions and services with global scale, local expertise and our e-commerce experience, enabling our clients to realize their digital ambitions in multiple ways. Our offerings in North America and certain countries in EMEA and APAC include hardware, software and services, including cloud solutions. Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA and APAC segments consist largely of software and certain software-related services and cloud solutions. 
 On a consolidated basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Net sales of 2.1 billion decreased 8 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net sales reflects decreases in hardware and software net sales, partially offset by an increase in services net sales. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales also decreased 8 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Gross profit of 432.1 million increased 6 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit increased 5 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, gross margin expanded approximately 270 basis points to 20.7 of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024. This expansion primarily reflects an increase in higher margin services net sales compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Earnings from operations increased 1 , year over year, to 92.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 91.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit in the current quarter, partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative expenses. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, earnings from operations also increased 1 year over year. 
 Net earnings and diluted earnings per share were 58.2 million and 1.52, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to net earnings of 60.2 million and diluted earnings per share of 1.62 for the third quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share decreased 6 year to year, and excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, also decreased 6 year to year.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

 Throughout the Quarterly Overview and Results of Operations sections of this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we refer to changes in net sales, gross profit, selling and administrative expenses and earnings from operations on a consolidated basis and in North America, EMEA and APAC excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, which are financial measures that are adjusted from our financial results prepared in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). We believe providing this information excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates provides valuable supplemental information to investors regarding our underlying business and results of operations, consistent with how we, including our management, evaluate our performance. In computing the changes in amounts and percentages, we compare the current period amount as translated into U.S. dollars under the applicable accounting standards to the prior period amount in local currency translated into U.S. dollars utilizing the weighted average translation rate for the current period. The performance measures excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 Details about segment results of operations can be found in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
 Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements, including the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that contributed to those changes, as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial statements. 
 Supply Chain Constraints, Demand and Inflation Update 
 
 Supply constraints that have had an industry-wide impact since the beginning of 2020 eased in the second half of 2023. We believe that any remaining supply constraints and extended lead times for certain infrastructure, including networking products, have now normalized back to near historic levels. Despite the easing supply constraints, we continue to see a general slowdown in our clients' decision making, which we believe will continue in the short term. 
 
 Inflation contributed to higher interest rates on all of our variable rate facilities. While these interest rates are expected to decrease, we anticipate higher than historical rates for the remainder of 2024. We are actively monitoring changes to the global macroeconomic environment, including those impacting our supply chain and interest rates, and assessing the potential impacts these challenges may have on our current results, financial condition and liquidity. We are also mindful of the potential impact these conditions could have on our clients, partners and prospects for the remainder of 2024 and beyond.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a summary of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ from estimates we have made. Members of our senior management have discussed the critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
 There have been no changes to the items disclosed as critical accounting estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 The following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net sales 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Costs of goods sold 79.3 82.0 80.0 82.2 Gross profit 20.7 18.0 20.0 17.8 Selling and administrative expenses 15.9 13.7 14.9 13.5 Severance and restructuring expenses, net and acquisition and integration related expenses 0.4 0.2 0.2 0.2 Earnings from operations 4.4 4.1 4.9 4.1 Non-operating expense, net 0.8 0.6 0.7 0.4 Earnings before income taxes 3.6 3.5 4.2 3.7 Income tax expense 0.8 0.8 1.0 1.0 Net earnings 2.8 2.7 3.2 2.7 
 We generally experience some seasonal trends in our sales of IT hardware, software and services. Software and certain cloud net sales are typically seasonally higher in our second and fourth quarters. Business clients, particularly larger enterprise businesses in the United States, tend to spend more, particularly on product, in our fourth quarter. Sales to the federal government in the United States are often stronger in our third quarter, while sales in the state and local government and education markets are also often stronger in our second quarter. Sales to public sector clients in the United Kingdom are often stronger in our first quarter. These trends create overall variability in our consolidated results. 
 Our gross profit across the business and related to product versus services sales are, and will continue to be, impacted by partner incentives, which can and do change significantly in the amounts made available and in the related product or services sales being incentivized by the partner. Incentives from our largest partners are significant and changes in the amounts and incentive requirements, including those related to cloud transactions, which occur regularly, have and could continue to impact our results of operations to the extent we are unable to shift our

 Net sales in North America decreased 8 , or 144.3 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by decreases in hardware and software net sales, partially offset by an increase in services net sales. Hardware and software net sales decreased 13 and 5 , year to year, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in services net sales of 9 . The net changes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were the result of the following: 
 The decrease in hardware net sales was due to lower volume of sales primarily to large enterprise and corporate clients due to lower demand. This decline was driven by infrastructure and device sales. 
 The decrease in software net sales was primarily due to changes in certain vendor relationships (shifting us from a principal to an agent role) as well as the continued migration of on-premise software to cloud solutions, in each case, reported net in services net sales. 
 The increase in services net sales was primarily due to higher sales of cloud solution offerings including from SADA and an increase in Insight Delivered services from SADA and Infocenter, partially offset by declines in Insight Delivered services

 North America's gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4 , or 14.2 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin expanded approximately 240 basis points to 20.3 for the third quarter of 2024. The year over year net expansion in gross margin was primarily attributable to the following: 
 An increase in services margin of 203 basis points and an expansion in product margin of 31 basis points. 
 The increase in services margin reflects an increase in fees for cloud solutions, including from SADA. There was also an increase in margin contribution from Insight Core services (consisting of Insight Delivered and managed services) from SADA and Infocenter, partially offset by a decline in margin contribution from organic Insight Core services and a decrease in software maintenance. 
 The expansion in product margin reflects an increase in margin contribution from software and hardware net sales due to selling product at higher margins than in the prior year period. 
 North America's gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6 , or 59.9 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin expanded approximately 190 basis points to 19.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The year over year net expansion in gross margin was primarily attributable to the following: 
 An increase in services margin of 187 basis points and an expansion in product margin of 4 basis points. 
 The increase in services margin primarily reflects an increase in fees for cloud solutions, including from SADA. The increase also reflects a net increase in margin contribution from Insight Core services from SADA and Infocenter, partially offset by a decline in margin contribution from organic Insight Core services. 
 The net expansion in product margin reflects an increase in margin contribution from software due to selling software at higher margins, partially offset by a decrease in margin contribution from hardware. 
 
 EMEA's gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 11 , or 6.7 million, year over year (increasing 9 when excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates), compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin expanded 440 basis points, year over year. The year over year net expansion in gross margin was attributable to the following: 
 
 An increase in services margin of 278 basis points and an expansion in product margin of 160 basis points. 
 The increase in services margin is primarily the result of increased fees for cloud solutions and increased margin contribution from Insight Core services, including from Amdaris. 
 The expansion in product margin is primarily the result of sales of hardware at higher margins than in the same period in the prior year. 
 
 EMEA's gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 14 , or 27.9 million, year over year (increasing 13 when excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates), compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 APAC's gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 15 , or 2.3 million, year over year (increasing 13 when excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates), compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin expanded approximately 10 basis points, year over year. The year over year net expansion in gross margin was primarily attributable to an expansion in product margin driven by sales of hardware at higher margins in connection with an infrastructure transaction in the current year period. 
 
 APAC's gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 11 , or 5.2 million, year over year (increasing 12 when excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates), compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin expanded approximately 190 basis points, year over year. The year over year net expansion in gross margin was primarily attributable to the following: 
 
 An expansion in services margin of 166 basis points and an expansion in product margin of 27 basis points. 
 The expansion in services margin was primarily driven by increased fees for cloud solutions and higher margin contribution from Insight Core services. 
 The expansion in product margin was driven by higher volume of sales of software at higher margins than in the prior year period. 
 Operating Expenses. 
 Selling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 7 , or 20.2 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 (increasing 6 when excluding fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates). Selling and administrative expenses increased 5 , or 46.6 million (also increasing 5 when excluding fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates), for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 210 basis points as a percentage of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The overall net increase in selling and administrative expenses primarily reflects increases in personnel costs, including teammate benefits and in depreciation and amortization expenses of 12.0 million and 10.6 million, respectively, year over year. The increase in personnel costs reflects an increase in overall teammate headcount resulting from our acquisitions and the impact of merit increases. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses primarily reflects higher amortization of intangible assets associated with the SADA, Infocenter and Amdaris acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a net decrease in other expenses. The net decrease in other expenses primarily reflects net gains of 6.4 million recognized on the revaluation of the Amdaris and Infocenter acquisition earnout liabilities and the resulting decreases in the fair values of the potential earnout payments combined with costs associated with certain third-party data center outages of 8.0 million incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2023 with no comparable costs in the three months ended September 30, 2024. We also incurred transformation costs in the current and prior year periods of 5.1 million and 3.7 million, respectively, however, these costs are unique in nature and are not expected to recur in the longer term.

 Selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 140 basis points as a percentage of net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall net increase in selling and administrative expenses primarily reflects increases in personnel costs, including teammate benefits and depreciation and amortization expenses of 38.3 million and 28.2 million, respectively, year over year. The increase in personnel costs reflects an increase in overall teammate headcount from our acquisitions and the impact of merit increases. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses reflects higher amortization of intangible assets associated with the SADA, Infocenter and Amdaris acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a net decrease in other expenses. The net decrease in other expenses primarily reflects net gains of 30.6 million recognized on the revaluation of the SADA, Amdaris and Infocenter acquisition earnout liabilities and the resulting decreases in the fair values of the potential earnout payments, as well as recoveries associated with certain third-party data center outages of 3.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to costs incurred of 8.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We also incurred transformation costs in the current and prior year periods of 13.0 million and 14.0 million, respectively, however, these costs are unique in nature and are not expected to recur in the longer term. 
 Severance and Restructuring Expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded severance and restructuring expenses, net of adjustments, of approximately 8.5 million. This includes approximately 4.3 million, net restructuring charges associated with costs to exit properties. Comparatively, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded severance and restructuring expenses of approximately 2.9 million. The severance charges in both periods primarily related to a realignment of certain roles and responsibilities and reductions in workforce. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded severance and restructuring expenses, net of adjustments, of approximately 15.6 million. This includes approximately 4.3 million, net restructuring charges associated with costs to exit properties. Comparatively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded severance and restructuring expense, net of adjustments, of approximately 3.0 million, reflecting a net gain on sale of property due to restructuring of 6.8 million. The severance charges in both periods primarily related to a realignment of certain roles and responsibilities and reductions in workforce. 
 Acquisition and Integration Related Expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded acquisition and integration related expenses of approximately 0.7 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded acquisition and integration related expenses of approximately 4.3 million. As the Company executes its acquisition strategy, we expect to incur additional acquisition and integration related expenses. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded acquisition and integration related expenses of approximately 2.2 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded acquisition and integration related expenses of approximately 4.4 million. The expenses in the current year period related primarily to the acquisitions of SADA in December 2023 and Infocenter in May 2024.

The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the issuance of the Senior Notes and higher loan balances under our ABL facility, partially offset by decreased imputed interest under our inventory financing facilities and higher interest income. 
 
 Imputed interest under our inventory financing facilities was 2.5 million and 7.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.2 million and 10.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in imputed interest under our inventory financing facilities was a result of lower average daily balances under the facilities during the period. For a description of our various financing facilities, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Income Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate of 22.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than our effective tax rate of 24.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to tax benefits related to the revaluation of certain acquisition earnout liabilities and increased tax benefits for research and development activities recorded in the current year period. 
 
 Our effective tax rate of 24.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than our effective tax rate of 25.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to tax benefits related to the revaluation of certain acquisition earnout liabilities and higher excess tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-based compensation in the current year period. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s (OECD) Pillar II Initiative introduced a 15 global minimum tax for certain multinational groups exceeding minimum annual global revenue thresholds. Several countries in which Insight operates have enacted legislation adopting the minimum tax effective January 1, 2024. The minimum tax did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate as of September 30, 2024, nor do we expect it to have a material impact on our 2024 annual effective tax rate. We will continue to monitor any future impact as additional countries enact legislation to adopt this tax.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following table sets forth certain consolidated cash flow information for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 417,731 413,742 Net cash used in investing activities (288,868) (96,430) Net cash used in financing activities (82,523) (235,628) Foreign currency exchange effect on cash, cash equivalent and restricted cash balances 2,660 (1,074) Increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 49,000 80,610 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 270,785 165,718 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period 319,785 246,328 
 Cash and Cash Flow 
 Our primary uses of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were to fund the acquisition of Infocenter, repay debt, including principal upon conversion of a portion of the Convertible Notes, fund repurchases of our common stock and to pay earnouts and other acquisition related payments. 
 Operating activities provided 417.7 million in cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by operating activities of 413.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Capital expenditures were 32.4 million and 29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid approximately 265.0 million, to acquire Infocenter, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired of 5.1 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 200.0 million of our common stock compared to 217.1 million of repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 W e issued 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, which we used to pay down a portion of our borrowings under our ABL facility. 
 We had net repayments under our ABL facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 333.3 million, using proceeds from the Senior Notes, compared to net borrowings of 34.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We had net borrowings under our inventory financing facilities of 3.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net repayments of 32.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with the funds available under our financing facilities, will be adequate to support our expected cash and working capital requirements for operations, as well as other strategic acquisitions, over the next 12 months and beyond. We expect existing cash and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating cash activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock, principal payment on the Convertible Notes that mature in February 2025 and are freely convertible at the option of the Convertible Note holders, debt repayments and repayment of our inventory financing facilities for the next 12 months. We currently expect to fund known cash commitments

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

 beyond the next 12 months through operating cash activities and/or other available financing resources. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 Our cash conversion cycle is inverted, meaning on average we pay our partners on terms shorter than we receive payments from our clients. This means we generate more cash in our operations in periods of sequential decline in sales and particularly in hardware net sales. 
 Cash flow provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 was 417.7 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of 413.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 1 during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Our consolidated cash flow operating metrics were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Days sales outstanding in ending accounts receivable DSOs (a) 
 172 125 Days inventory outstanding DIOs (b) 
 8 9 Days purchases outstanding in ending accounts payable DPOs (c) 
 (162) (99) Cash conversion cycle (days) (d) 
 18 35 
 (a) Calculated as the balance of current accounts receivable, net at the end of the quarter divided by daily net sales. Daily net sales is calculated as net sales for the quarter divided by 92 days. 
 (b) Calculated as the balance of inventories at the end of the quarter divided by daily costs of goods sold. Daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by 92 days. 
 (c) Calculated as the sum of the balances of accounts payable trade and accounts payable inventory financing facilities at the end of the quarter divided by daily costs of goods sold. Daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by 92 days. 
 (d) Calculated as DSOs plus DIOs, less DPOs. 
 Our cash conversion cycle was 18 days in the third quarter of 2024, down from 35 days in the third quarter of 2023. 
 The net changes were a result of a 63 day increase in DPOs and a 1 day decrease in DIOs, partially offset by a 47 day increase in DSOs. 
 The net decrease in our cash conversion cycle year over year was primarily the result of: 
 the impact to DPOs of the SADA acquisition, a significant agency transaction that based on its terms had not cleared by quarter end and changes in vendor mix; 
 the benefit to DIOs of the reduction in hardware sales and changes in our operating strategy; and 
 the impact to DSOs of the SADA acquisition combined with a significant agency transaction that based on its terms had not cleared by quarter end. 
 Our cash conversion cycle is impacted by netted costs that we apply to our services net sales to appropriately record net sales that we earn as an agent. These netted costs, while excluded from both net sales and cost of goods sold, are processed and applied to accounts receivable and accounts payable in each reporting period. As a result, our DSO and DPO calculated on the basis of unadjusted net sales and 
 39 

Table of Contents 
 INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

 unadjusted cost of goods sold are inherently inflated. Netted costs were 2.4 billion and 1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Adjusting our cash conversion cycle calculation by adding netted costs to both daily net sales and daily cost of goods sold results in a decrease to our cash conversion cycle from 18 days to 17 days in the third quarter of 2024 and results in a decrease from 35 days down to 25 days in the third quarter of 2023, which we believe provides a more accurate reflection of our cash flow operating metrics. 
 We expect that cash flow from operations will be used, at least partially, to fund working capital as we typically pay our partners on average terms that are shorter than the average terms we grant to our clients to take advantage of supplier discounts. 
 We intend to use cash generated in the remainder of 2024 in excess of working capital needs to pay down our ABL facility and inventory financing facilities and for strategic acquisitions. 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 
 We paid 265.0 million to acquire Infocenter on May 1, 2024, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired of 5.1 million. Additionally, we paid 5.2 million, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, to acquire an entity in our EMEA segment, on July 1, 2024. 
 We acquired Amdaris for approximately 82.9 million, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired and excluding earn outs and hold backs in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 We received proceeds from the sale of assets of 13.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We received proceeds from the sale of assets, including our properties held for sale, of 15.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Capital expenditures were 32.4 million and 29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We expect capital expenditures for the full year 2024 to be in a range of 35.0 to 40.0 million. 
 Net cash used in financing activities 
 In May 2024, we issued 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, which we used to pay down a portion of our borrowings under our ABL facility. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net repayments under our ABL facility of 333.3 million using proceeds from the Senior Notes. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net borrowings under our ABL facility that increased our outstanding long-term debt balance by 34.3 million. 
 We had net borrowings under our inventory financing facilities of 3.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net repayments of 32.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We repaid approximately 16.9 million principal upon conversion of a portion of the Convertible Notes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with no comparable activity in the prior year period. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made earnout and acquisition related payments of 18.3 million associated with our Amdaris and Hanu acquisitions. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid 10.7 million, the majority of the earnout associated with the Hanu acquisition. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 200.0 million of our common stock.

 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 217.1 million of our common stock. 
 
 Financing Facilities 
 Our debt balance as of September 30, 2024 was 1,086.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, the current portion of our long-term debt primarily relates to the Convertible Notes. 
 
 Our objective is to pay our debt balances down while retaining adequate cash balances to meet overall business objectives. 
 The Convertible Notes are subject to certain events of default and certain acceleration clauses. As of September 30, 2024, no such events have occurred. 
 The Senior Notes are subject to certain events of default and certain acceleration clauses. As of September 30, 2024, no such events have occurred. 
 Our ABL facility contains various covenants customary for transactions of this type, including complying with a minimum receivable and inventory requirement and meeting monthly, quarterly and annual reporting requirements. 
 The credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. 
 At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants. 
 While the ABL facility has a stated maximum amount, the actual availability under the ABL facility is limited by a minimum accounts receivable and inventory requirement. As of September 30, 2024, eligible accounts receivable and inventory were sufficient to permit access to the full 1.8 billion under the ABL facility of which 262.4 million was outstanding. 
 We also have agreements with financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. 
 These amounts are classified separately as accounts payable inventory financing facilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 
 Our inventory financing facilities have an aggregate availability for vendor purchases of 705.0 million, of which 235.2 million was outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Undistributed Foreign Earnings 
 Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the United States. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 272.1 million in cash and cash equivalents in certain of our foreign subsidiaries, primarily residing in Canada, the Netherlands and Australia. Certain of these cash balances will be remitted to the United States by paying down intercompany payables generated in the ordinary course of business or through actual dividend distributions. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, which include indemnifications. The indemnifications are discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report and such discussion is incorporated by reference herein. We believe that none of our off-balance sheet arrangements have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards

 Except as described below, there have been no material changes in our reported market risks, as described in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Although our Convertible Notes and Senior Notes are based on fixed rates, changes in interest rates could impact the fair market value of such notes. As of September 30, 2024, the fair market value of our Convertible Notes and Senior Notes was 1,042.9 million and 521.3 million, respectively. For additional information about our Convertible Notes and Senior Notes, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) and determined that as of September 30, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) in the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
