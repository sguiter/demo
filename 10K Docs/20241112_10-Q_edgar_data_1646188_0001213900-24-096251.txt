STATEMENTS

. As of September 30, 2024, we had net long-term borrowings outstanding of approximately 
net of debt discount and issuance costs of and short-term borrowings outstanding of approximately , net of debt discount
and issuance cost of approximately and a working capital deficit of approximately . 

In 2023, we raised approximately of net proceeds from the
sale of redeemable preferences shares in Ondas Networks and warrants in Ondas Holdings to third parties, and approximately 
from a second convertible debt agreement. In the first nine months of 2024, we raised net proceeds of approximately from the
sale of additional redeemable preferred shares in Ondas Networks and warrants in Ondas Holdings to third parties, approximately 
in net proceeds from issuing common stock, par value per share Common Stock ), of Ondas Holdings and warrants in
OAS, approximately in net proceeds from issuance of a secured note and convertible note in Ondas Networks, and approximately
 in government grant loans issued to Airobotics. On November 9, 2024, we entered into an agreement with Klear Inc., which provides
for financing of accounts receivable, and we have financed approximately so far at Ondas Networks. 

We expect to fund our operations
for the next twelve months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q from the cash on hand as of September 30, 2024,
proceeds from the 2024 financing activities discussed above, gross profits generated from revenue growth, potential prepayments from customers
for purchase orders, potential proceeds from warrants issued and outstanding, and additional funds that we may seek through equity or
debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. There is substantial doubt that the
funding plans will be successful and therefore the conditions discussed above have not been alleviated. As a result, there is substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from November 12, 2024, the date the unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements were issued. 

Our future capital requirements
will depend upon many factors, including progress with developing, manufacturing and marketing our technologies, the time and costs involved
in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights, our ability to establish collaborative
arrangements, marketing activities and competing technological and market developments, including regulatory changes and overall economic
conditions in our target markets. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability requires us to successfully market and secure
purchase orders for our products and services from customers currently identified in our sales pipeline as well as new customers. We
also will be required to efficiently manufacture and deliver equipment on those purchase orders. These activities, including our planned
research and development efforts, will require significant uses of working capital. There can be no assurance that we will generate revenue
and cash as expected in our current business plan. We may seek additional funds through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under
additional notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. We do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially
acceptable terms or at all, when needed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially acceptable terms, our
ability to fund our operations, support the growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly
delayed or limited, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.

Warrants to Purchase Common Stock of the Company 

We use the Black-Scholes
Model to determine the fair value of warrants to purchase Common Stock of the Company. The Black-Scholes Model is an acceptable model
in accordance with U.S GAAP. The Black-Scholes Model requires the use of a number of assumptions including volatility of the stock price,
the weighted average risk-free interest rate, and the weighted average term of the warrant. 

The risk-free interest rate
assumption is based upon observed interest rates on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds whose maturity period is appropriate for the term
of the warrants. Estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the
expected life of the award. Our estimated volatility is an average of the historical volatility of peer entities whose stock prices were
publicly available over a period equal to the expected life of the awards. We used the historical volatility of peer entities due to
the lack of sufficient historical data of our stock price.

Overview 

Ondas Holdings Inc. Ondas Holdings, Ondas, 
the Company, we or our is a leading provider of private wireless, drone, and automated data
solutions through its subsidiaries Ondas Networks Inc., a Texas corporation Ondas Networks and Ondas Autonomous Systems
Inc., a Nevada corporation OAS ), which wholly-owns Airobotics, Ltd., an Israeli company Airobotics ), and
American Robotics, Inc., a Delaware corporation American Robotics or AR ). On August 8, 2024, the Company
filed a certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, amending Ondas Autonomous Holdings Inc. s name
to Ondas Autonomous Systems Inc. 

Ondas Networks provides wireless
connectivity solutions. OAS provides drone and automated data solutions through its subsidiaries Airobotics and American Robotics. Ondas
Networks and OAS together provide users in rail, energy, mining, public safety and critical infrastructure and government markets with
improved connectivity, data collection capabilities, and data collection and information processing capabilities. We operate Ondas Networks
and OAS as separate business segments, and the following is a discussion of each segment. See Note 1, Note 2, and Note 12 of the accompanying
unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our segments. 

Ondas Networks Segment 

Ondas Networks provides wireless
connectivity solutions enabling mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services. We refer to these applications as the
Mission-Critical Internet of Things MC-IoT ). Our wireless networking products are applicable to a wide range of MC-IoT
applications, which are most often located at the very edge of large industrial networks. These applications require secure, real-time
connectivity with the ability to process large amounts of data at the edge of large industrial networks. Such applications are required
in all of the major critical infrastructure markets, including rail, electric grids, drones, oil and gas, and public safety, homeland
security and government, where secure, reliable and fast operational decisions are required in order to improve efficiency and ensure
a high degree of safety and security. 

We design, develop, manufacture,
sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio SDR platform for secure, licensed, private, wide-area broadband
networks. Our customers install FullMAX systems in order to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area network infrastructure. We have
targeted the North American freight rail operators for the initial adoption of our FullMAX platform. These rail operators currently operate
legacy communications systems utilizing serial-based narrowband wireless technologies for voice and data communications. These legacy
wireless networks have limited data capacity and are unable to support the adoption of new, intelligent train control and management systems.
Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE ), the leading
worldwide standards body in data networking protocols, and forms the core of the IEEE 802.16 standard. Because standards-based communications
solutions are preferred by our mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, we continue to take a leadership position in IEEE as
it relates to wireless networking for industrial markets. As such, management believes this standards-based approach supports the adoption
of our technology across a burgeoning ecosystem of global partners and end markets. 

42 

Our software-based FullMAX
platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and operated wireless wide-area networks, leveraging Internet
Protocol-based communications to provide more reliability and data capacity for our mission-critical infrastructure customers. We believe
industrial and critical infrastructure markets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy serial and analog based
protocols and network transport systems no longer meet industry needs. In addition to offering enhanced data throughput, FullMAX is an
intelligent networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and equipment supporting next-generation MC-IoT
applications over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications and related equipment require more processing power at the edge of large
industrial networks and the efficient utilization of network capacity and scarce bandwidth resources which can be supported by the Fog-computing 
capability integrated in our end-to-end network platform. Fog-computing utilizes management software to enable edge compute processing
and data and application prioritization in the field enabling our customers more reliable, real-time operating control of these new, intelligent
MC-IoT equipment and applications at the edge. 

Partnership with Siemens and Market Advancements 

Ondas Networks and Siemens
Mobility Siemens ), have a strategic partnership, to both market our FullMAX-based networking technology and services and
to jointly develop wireless communications products for the North American Rail Industry based on Siemens Advanced Train Control
System ATCS protocol and our FullMAX MC-IoT platform. 

We believe Siemens has both
the sales and marketing reach and support to drive our technology to wide scale acceptance across the global rail market beginning with
the North American Class I Railroad market. We have a jointly-developed product with Siemens the dual-mode ATCS/MC-IoT radio systems,
and Siemens is marketing and selling our proprietary systems under the brand name Airlink to our railroad customers. The dual-mode
ATCS radio systems support Siemens extensive installed base of ATCS radios as well as offer Siemens customers the ability
to support a host of new advanced rail applications utilizing our MC-IoT wireless system. These new applications, including Advanced Grade
Crossing Activation and Monitoring, Wayside Inspection, Railcar Monitoring and next generation signaling and train control systems, are
designed to increase railroad productivity, reduce costs and improve safety. In addition, Siemens markets and sells Ondas Networks 
standalone MC-IoT 802.16 products under the Siemens Airlink brand. 

We developed a new radio for
the Head of Train (HOT) Market in North America and a similar product for the Indian rail market. Siemens delivered these 900 MHz rail
orders for a major Class I Railroad in the United States and received HOT orders for the Indian market. 

Ondas and Siemens developed a new locomotive radio to support European
Railroads. We secured an initial volume order from Siemens for the Class I Rail 900 MHz Network consisting of both ATCS compatible products
along with Ondas catalog products. We received government authorization to sell ATCS radios in Canada and, along with Siemens,
launched our joint effort for the European market at Innotrans in Berlin. Siemens and Ondas demonstrated our over the air compatibility
to systems used by passenger rails in the Northeast Corridor of the US. 

In March 2023 the Association
of American Railroads AAR formally announced that IEEE 802.16 standard would be the wireless platform for the greenfield
900 MHz network. In April 2023, the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association (AREMA) voted to require the use of
802.16 in the 900 MHz greenfield band; The AAR also confirmed they have agreed with the Federal Communications Committee to retire the
legacy 900 MHz band by September 2025 and that the wireless network in the new 900 MHz band would be substantially built by April 2026.
In May and June 2023, we responded to RFPs to passenger rail customers in the Northeast Corridor. In February 2024, Siemens was selected
by Amtrak to deliver their next generation radio based on Ondas FullMAX technology and the 802.16 standard. 

43 

Our
relationship with Siemens has expanded significantly since entering into the partnership both with (i) the wider marketing of our wireless
technology platform and (ii) multiple additional joint-product programs. Siemens has expanded its marketing reach of Ondas Networks products
with identified opportunities in North American Transit Rail as well as in European and Asian Rail markets. We believe our technology
has broad potential in these large, newly targeted markets. 

OAS Segment 

Our OAS business unit develops
and integrates drone-based solutions focusing on high-performance critical applications for government and Tier-1 commercial enterprises.
Ondas is marketing comprehensive drone-based solutions to address the needs of governmental and commercial customers based on its commercially
available platforms: the Optimus System , a fully autonomous drone platform capable of continuous and multipurpose aerial data capturing
and analytics, and the Iron Drone Raider , a fully autonomous interceptor drone designed to neutralize small hostile drones. 

Our unique, fully autonomous
platforms enable cutting-edge aerial capabilities and are designed to serve and protect critical infrastructure and operations. Our business
focuses on end-user entities in Public Safety, Defense, Homeland Security, Smart City, Port Authorities, State Departments, and other
governmental entities together with commercial customers of industrial sensitive facilities such as Oil Gas, Seaports, Mining, and
Heavy Construction. For these industries, OAS provides specialized real-time aerial data capturing and aerial protection solutions in
the most complex environments such as urban areas, sensitive and critical facilities and field area operations, and high-priority projects.
In addition, we offer a wide suite of supplementary, enabling services for successful implementation such as AI data analytics, data automation,
IT implementation, safety planning, certification, training, and maintenance, handling all the complex aspects of such high-performance
drone operations. 

Our portfolio companies, American
Robotics and Airobotics, form a unique, powerful, and synergistic combination covering all the aspects required for successful Aerospace
business together with data technologies and services for digital transformation industries. Our companies are specialized in addressing
all the challenges arising along these types of product lifecycles including research and development, manufacturing, certification, and
ongoing support. 

OAS and its portfolio companies have already gained a track record
of industry-leading regulatory successes including the securing of the first-of-its-kind Type Certification TC from the
Federal Aviation Administration FAA for the Optimus 1-EX UAV on September 25, 2023, becoming the first autonomous security
data capture UAV to achieve this distinction. TC, recognized as the highest echelon of Airworthiness Certification, streamline operational
approvals for broad flight operations over people and infrastructure. The certification verifies the compliance of the system s
design with the required FAA airworthiness and noise standards, ensuring safe operation within the US National Airspace System (NAS) thereby
significantly broadening the range of operational scenarios and scaling up of operations for automated UAS. Achieving FAA Type Certification
will enable drone operations beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) without a human operator on-site. With a strong footprint in the US market
and worldwide, we believe that OAS is well-positioned with proven technology, a unique offering, and strong capabilities to strategically
transform critical operations with our cutting-edge drone tech and capabilities. 

War in Israel 

On October 7, 2023, the State
of Israel, where Airobotics main offices and facilities are located, suffered a surprise attack by hostile forces from the Gaza
Strip, which led to the Security Cabinet of the State of Israel declaring a state of war in Israel. This military operation and related
activities are on-going as of the date of this filing. 

44 

The Company has considered
various ongoing risks relating to the military operation and related matters, including: 

That approximately 17 of the Company s workforce in Israel was called to active duty, which temporarily reduced our workforce; 

That some of the Company s Israeli subcontractors, vendors, suppliers and other companies in which the Company relies, are currently only partially active, as instructed by the relevant authorities or due to personnel shortages related to the war effort, which resulted in a temporary delay of inventory production; and 

A slowdown in the number of international flights in and out of Israel. 

The Company is closely monitoring
how the military operation and related activities could adversely affect its anticipated milestones and its Israel-based activities to
support future operations, including the Company s ability to import materials that are required to construct the Optimus System 
and to ship them outside of Israel. As of the date of this Report, the Company has determined that there have not been any materially
adverse effects on its business or operations, but it continues to monitor the situation, as any future escalation or change could result
in a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company s Israeli office to support the Company s activities. The Company
does not have any specific contingency plans in the event of any such escalation or change.

The principal use of cash
in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was to fund the Company s current expenses primarily related
to operating activities necessary to allow us to service and support customers. The decrease in cash flows used in operating activities
of 2,748,095 was primarily due to the decrease in net loss of approximately 3,034,000, of which approximately 1,348,000 related to
non-cash and credits, including depreciation, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, amortization of intangibles assets and
right of use asset, stock-based compensation, and change in fair value of government grant liability, combined with changes in operating
assets and liabilities resulting in a cash inflow of approximately 1,062,000. 

The decrease in cash flows provided by investing activities of 2,304,302,
relates to an increase of approximately 1,536,000 in payments made for purchase of equipment, net of proceeds from disposals, software
intangibles and patent costs, combined with decrease of approximately 1,049,000 for cash acquired with the Airobotics acquisition in
the nine months end September 30, 2023, partially offset by the decrease of approximately 281,000 for cash paid for asset acquisitions
in the nine months end September 30, 2023. 

The decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities of 3,829,302
primarily relates to a decrease in net proceeds received from the sale of preferred stock in Ondas Networks of approximately 10,317,000;
a decrease of approximately 3,472,000 in net proceeds from convertible notes, net of issuance costs, net of cash repayments. This decrease
in cash flows provided by financing activities is offset by an increase in proceeds received from the sale of common stock in the Company
and options exercised of approximately of 7,325,000; an increase of approximately 2,518,000 in proceeds from notes payable, net of issuance
costs, net of cash repayments; and an increase of approximately 117,000 in cash proceeds received from government grants, net of payments.
For a summary of our outstanding Notes Payable, see Note 8 in the accompanying Notes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have incurred losses since
inception and have funded our operations primarily through debt and the sale of capital stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated
deficit of approximately 226,032,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had net long-term borrowings outstanding of approximately 2,217,000
net of debt discount and issuance costs of 0 and short-term borrowings outstanding of approximately 30,751,000, net of debt discount
and issuance cost of approximately 1,537,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately 22,341,000. 

In 2023, we raised approximately 14,692,000 of net proceeds from the
sale of redeemable preferences shares in Ondas Networks and warrants in Ondas Holdings to third parties, and approximately 9,310,000
from a second convertible debt agreement. In the first nine months of 2024, we raised net proceeds of approximately 4,375,000 from the
sale of additional redeemable preferred shares in Ondas Networks and warrants in Ondas Holdings to third parties, approximately 7,327,000
in net proceeds from issuing Common Stock of Ondas Holdings and warrants in OAS, approximately 2,860,000 in net proceeds from issuance
of a secured note and convertible note in Ondas Networks, and approximately 300,000 in government grant loans issued to Airobotics. On
November 9, 2024, we entered into an agreement with Klear Inc., which provides for financing of accounts receivable, and we have financed
approximately 500,000 so far at Ondas Networks. 

We expect to fund our operations
for the next twelve months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q from the cash on hand as of September 30, 2024,
proceeds from the 2024 financing activities discussed above, gross profits generated from revenue growth, potential prepayments from customers
for purchase orders, potential proceeds from warrants issued and outstanding, and additional funds that we may seek through equity or
debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. There is substantial doubt that the
funding plans will be successful and therefore the conditions discussed above have not been alleviated. As a result, there is substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from November 12, 2024, the date the unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements were issued. 

Our future capital requirements
will depend upon many factors, including progress with developing, manufacturing and marketing our technologies, the time and costs involved
in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights, our ability to establish collaborative
arrangements, marketing activities and competing technological and market developments, including regulatory changes and overall economic
conditions in our target markets. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability requires us to successfully market and secure
purchase orders for our products from customers currently identified in our sales pipeline as well as new customers. We also will be required
to efficiently manufacture and deliver equipment on those purchase orders. These activities, including our planned research and development
efforts, will require significant uses of working capital. There can be no assurances that we will generate revenue and cash flow as expected
in our current business plan. We may seek additional funds through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes
payable, lines of credit or other sources. We do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms
or at all, when needed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially acceptable terms, our ability to fund
our operations, support the growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or limited,
which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

52 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Management s discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities
and expenses, as well as related disclosures. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that
we believe to be reasonable at the time and under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
Information concerning our critical accounting policies with respect to these items is available in Item 7, Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no significant
changes in our critical accounting policies since the filing of the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

There have been no material
changes to our significant accounting policies as summarized in Note 2 of our 2023 Form 10-K. We do not expect that the adoption of any
recent accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on our accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Report, as well as information
included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us, contain statements that constitute forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can
be identified by words such as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, intends, 
 plans, predicts, projects, will be, will continue, will likely
result, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance.
These forward-looking statements are based on our current, reasonable expectations and assumptions, which expectations and assumptions
are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our 2023 Form
10-K, which was filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required
by law. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1) and are not required to provide information under this item. 

53 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company s management,
with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive
Officer and the Company s Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the
Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures 

In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative
to their costs.
