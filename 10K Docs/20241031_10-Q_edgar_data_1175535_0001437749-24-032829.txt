common shares of beneficial interest of the Maryland entity. We serve as the general partner of Whitestone REIT Operating Partnership, L.P. (the Operating Partnership ), which was formed on December 31, 1998 as a Delaware limited partnership. We currently conduct substantially all of our operations and activities through the Operating Partnership. As the general partner of the Operating Partnership, we have the exclusive power to manage and conduct the business of the Operating Partnership, subject to certain customary exceptions. For both periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , Whitestone wholly owned commercial properties in and around Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Phoenix and San Antonio.

 As of September 30, 2024 , our ownership in Pillarstone Capital REIT Operating Partnership LP Pillarstone or Pillarstone OP no longer represents a majority interest. On January 25, 2024, the Company exercised its notice of redemption for substantially all of its investment in Pillarstone OP. As of the date of this filing, Whitestone has not received consideration for its redemption of its equity investment in Pillarstone OP as required by the partnership agreement. On March 4, 2024, Pillarstone Capital REIT Pillarstone REIT authorized and filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy (the Pillarstone Bankruptcies of itself, Pillarstone OP, and all of its remaining special purpose entities in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the Bankruptcy Court ). The Company has filed a claim in the Pillarstone Bankruptcies for the value of its redemption claim along with interest and other costs. We intend to pursue collection of amounts due from Pillarstone OP through all means necessary and while we do not know the ultimate amount to be collected, we believe the amount will be in excess of the current carrying value of our receivable, formerly our equity investment in Pillarstone OP. Please refer to Note 6 in this Quarterly Report on form 10 -Q for more information regarding the accounting treatment of the redemption of our OP units in Pillarstone OP.

As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had one ground lease and one office machine lease that were classified as finance leases. The ground lease provides for variable rental payments based on CPI adjustment.

As of September 30, 2024 , our ownership in Pillarstone OP no longer represents a majority interest. On January 25, 2024, the Company exercised its notice of redemption for substantially all of its investment in Pillarstone OP. As of the date of this filing, we have not received consideration for our redemption of our equity investment in Pillarstone OP as required by the partnership agreement.

In connection with the Contribution, Whitestone TRS, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company Whitestone TRS ), entered into a management agreement with the entities that own the contributed Pillarstone Properties (collectively, the Management Agreements ). Pursuant to the Management Agreements, Whitestone TRS agreed to provide certain property management, leasing and day-to-day advisory and administrative services. The Management Agreements were terminated on August 18, 2022. Prior to the termination of the Management Agreement, we reported approximately in property management fee income on a quarterly basis. 
 
 The table below presents the real estate partnership investment in which we hold an ownership interest (in thousands):

1 Representing eight property interests and square feet of GLA, as of December 31, 2023. Subsequent to January 25, 2024, we ceased utilizing the equity method following the exercise of our notice of redemption for the majority of our investment in Pillarstone OP. We reclassified our investment in Pillarstone OP to a receivable on our balance sheet after estimating 25 days of our share of the equity investment income. 

2 On December 26, 2021, the Board of Trustees of Pillarstone REIT adopted a new shareholder rights agreement (the Pillarstone Rights Agreement ). Because Pillarstone REIT sought to use the Pillarstone Rights Agreement to prevent us from exercising our contractual Redemption Right, on July 12, 2022, we filed suit against Pillarstone REIT in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware challenging the Pillarstone Rights Agreement. On September 8, 2022, our Motion to Preserve the Status Quo was granted by the Court, limiting Pillarstone OP from engaging in any acts outside the ordinary course of business and otherwise imposing restrictions on Pillarstone OP to ensure that our right of redemption is not impaired while the underlying dispute is being considered by the Court. On January 25, 2024, the Delaware Court of Chancery: held that Pillarstone breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it adopted the Pillarstone Rights Agreement that thwarted us from exercising the unfettered contractual redemption right we obtained in connection with our investment in the partnership; and the Court held that the Rights Plan was unenforceable as to the limited partner and allowed us to exercise its redemption right; allowed Pillarstone to determine the current value of the Partnership s assets; and, as necessary, later enter a monetary judgment against Pillarstone for the difference between the amount we would have received in or around December 2021 and the current value. On January 25, 2024, we exercised our notice of redemption for substantially all of its investment in Pillarstone OP. On March 4, 2024, Pillarstone REIT authorized and filed the Pillarstone Bankruptcies. As of the date of this filing, we have not received consideration for its redemption of our equity investment in Pillarstone OP as required by the partnership agreement. We have filed a claim in the Pillarstone Bankruptcies for the value of its redemption claim along with interest and other costs. We intend to pursue collection of amounts due from Pillarstone OP through all means necessary and while we do not know the ultimate amount to be collected, we believe the amount will be in excess of the current carrying value of our equity investment in Pillarstone OP. 

3 We rely on reporting provided to us by Pillarstone OP s general partner for financial information regarding our investment in Pillarstone OP. Because Pillarstone OP financial statements as of December 31, 2023 have not been made available to us, we have estimated the value of the investment based on the information available to us at the time of this report. 

The table below presents our share of net loss from our investment in the real estate partnership which is included in deficit in earnings of real estate partnership, net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) (in thousands):

1 We rely on reporting provided to us by Pillarstone OP's general partner for financial information regarding our investment in Pillarstone OP. Because Pillarstone OP financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have not been made available to us, we have estimated net loss and its components based on the information available to us at the time of this report. 

2 The estimated net loss and its components are calculated through January 25, 2024, the redemption date. 

The amortization of the basis difference between the cost of investment and our share of underlying net book value for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is and respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is and . We fully amortized the difference into deficit in earnings of real estate partnership on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 The Company has evaluated its guarantee to Pillarstone OP pursuant to ASC 460, Guarantees, and has determined the guarantee to be a performance guarantee, for which ASC 460 contains initial recognition and measurement requirements, and related disclosure requirements. The Company is obligated in two respects: (i) a noncontingent liability, which represents the Company s obligation to stand ready to perform under the terms of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering event(s) occur; and (ii) the contingent liability, which represents the Company s obligation to make future payments if those triggering events occur. The fair value of our loan guarantee to Pillarstone OP is estimated on a Level 3 basis (as provided by ASC 820 ), using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis based on a discount rate, discounting the loan balance. The Company recognized a noncontingent liability of at the inception of the guarantee at fair value which is recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheets, net of accumulated amortization. The Company amortized the guarantee liability into income over seven years. For both three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the amortization of the guarantee liability was . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the amortization of the guarantee liability was and , respectively. 
 
 Estimates regarding Pillarstone OP's guarantee . The Company, through its subsidiary Whitestone REIT Operating Partnership, L.P., guaranteed Pillarstone OP s loan for its Uptown Tower property located in Dallas, Texas, with an aggregate principal amount of million as of September 30, 2023. The loan was also secured by the Uptown Tower property. The debt matured on October 4, 2023, and was in default, as Pillarstone OP failed to refinance the loan. On October 24, 2023, the Lender provided notice of a planned foreclosure sale on December 5, 2023. The Lender also claimed that an additional sum of million was due which included default interest of approximately million and net credits from escrowed funds and other charges of approximately million. 
 
 On December 1, 2023, the Company reached an agreement with the Lender that would avoid foreclosure and secure the release of the lien and discharge of the guarantee, and the Company negotiated and satisfied a payoff as of December 4, 2023, in the amount of (the DPO Amount ). We paid the DPO amount and will be entitled to assert a subrogation claim against Pillarstone OP. As of September 30, 2024, the DPO amount was recorded as an asset in our financial statement line receivable due from related party. 
 
 The DPO Amount included a compromise settlement of approximately for the disputed default interest and other fees. 
 
 On December 1, 2023, Pillarstone OP authorized and filed the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of its special purpose entity borrower that owns Uptown Tower (Whitestone Uptown Tower LLC) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. 
 
 On January 25, 2024, the Company exercised its notice of redemption for substantially all of its investment in Pillarstone OP. 
 
 On February 9, 2024, the Lender filed suit in New York County, New York against the guarantor Whitestone OP and the Company for alleged amounts due under the guarantee. The compromise settlement is our best estimate of the amount due. 
 
 On March 4, 2024, Pillarstone REIT authorized and filed the Pillarstone Bankruptcies. As of the date of this filing, Whitestone has not received consideration for our redemption of our equity investment in Pillarstone OP as required by the partnership agreement. The Company has filed a claim in the Pillarstone Bankruptcies for the value of its redemption claim along with interest and other costs. 
 
 On April 24, 2024, the Lender and Pillarstone OP filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking approval to settle the dispute and dismiss their mutual lawsuits including the lawsuit by the Lender against the Company as Guarantor of the loan. On or before June 10, 2024, Pillarstone OP agreed to pay to the Lender the sum of plus all attorneys fees and costs not to exceed incurred by the Lender from April 10, 2024 through the date of receipt of such payment. Upon timely receipt of the cash payment from Pillarstone OP, the Lender applied the 13,632,764 tendered to it by Whitestone REIT Operating Partnership, L.P., and the guaranty was subsequently released. On October 2, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court affirmed the Company s right of subrogation and allowed the Company s secured claim for the DPO amount. 
 
 The Company does not believe a probable loss will be incurred, nor does it anticipate a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity. Therefore, the Company has not recorded a charge as a result of the Pillarstone Bankruptcies. 
 
 Accounting treatment of the redemption of our OP units in Pillarstone OP . On January 25, 2024, we executed an irrevocable redemption of substantially all our investment in Pillarstone OP, converting our equity investment into a receivable. Pillarstone OP conveyed their intention to forego issuing equity, opting instead to liquidate the properties to satisfy creditors, with Whitestone being significantly the largest creditor. Based on insights from our legal team and advisors, we anticipate that the most probable outcome will involve the liquidation of all Pillarstone properties. 
 
 The carrying value of our investment in Pillarstone OP was approximately million as of January 25, 2024. We assert a claim of million, inclusive of the million default interest payment and accrued interest. It is anticipated that the claim and proceeds from liquidation will surpass the carrying value of our receivable for the redemption of our former equity investment in Pillarstone OP. 
 
 Subsequently, we reclassified our investment in Pillarstone OP to a receivable on our balance sheet after estimating 25 days of our share of the equity investment income. We will assess the credit losses of the receivable on a quarterly basis. 
 
 Any gains will be recognized once the proceeds received exceed our receivable. 
 
 This is within the scope of ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. The value of the unencumbered assets of Pillarstone OP is significantly in excess of Whitestone s basis in the account receivable, but the precise value cannot be determined at this time. When applying the estimated loss rate method with a zero loss rate, the Current Expected Credit Losses CECL are zero according to ASC 326. We will continue to monitor our legal team's assessment of the bankruptcy case and the value of the assets of Pillarstone OP to evaluate the credit risk of the receivable.

 The Operating Partnership may prepay at any time all, or from time to time part of, the Notes, in an amount not less than in the case of a partial prepayment, at of the principal amount so prepaid, plus a make-whole amount. The make-whole amount is equal to the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments with respect to the Notes being prepaid over the aggregate principal amount of such Notes (as described in the Note Agreement). In addition, in connection with a Change of Control (as defined in the Note Agreement), the Operating Partnership is required to offer to prepay the Notes at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

 Former CEO Litigation 
 
 On February 23, 2022, the Company s former CEO, James Mastandrea, filed suit against the Company and certain of its trustees (Nandita Berry, Jeff Jones, Jack Mahaffey, and David Taylor) and officers (David Holeman, Christine Mastandrea, Peter Tropoli) in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, alleging million in damages and equitable relief claims relating to the termination of his employment, including breach of his employment contract, negligence, tortious interference with contract, civil conspiracy, and declaratory judgment.

Pillarstone Rights Plan 
 
 On December 26, 2021, the Board of Trustees of Pillarstone REIT adopted a new shareholder rights agreement (the Pillarstone Rights Agreement ). Because Pillarstone REIT sought to use the Pillarstone Rights Agreement to prevent Whitestone OP from exercising its contractual Redemption Right, on July 12, 2022, Whitestone OP filed suit against Pillarstone REIT in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware challenging the Pillarstone Rights Agreement. 
 
 On September 8, 2022, Whitestone OP s Motion to Preserve the Status Quo was granted by the Court, limiting Pillarstone OP from engaging in any acts outside the ordinary course of business and otherwise imposing restrictions on Pillarstone OP to ensure that Whitestone s right of redemption is not impaired while the underlying dispute is being considered by the Court. 
 
 On January 25, 2024, the Delaware Court of Chancery: held that Pillarstone breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it adopted the Pillarstone Rights Agreement that thwarted Whitestone OP from exercising the unfettered contractual redemption right it obtained in connection with its investment in the partnership; and the Court held that the Rights Plan was unenforceable as to the limited partner and allowed Whitestone OP to exercise its redemption right; allowed Pillarstone to determine the current value of the Partnership s assets; and, as necessary, would later enter a monetary judgment against Pillarstone for the difference between the amount Whitestone would have received in or around December 2021 and the current value. 
 
 On January 25, 2024, the Company exercised its notice of redemption for substantially all of its investment in Pillarstone OP. 
 
 On March 4, 2024, Pillarstone REIT authorized and filed the Pillarstone Bankruptcies. 
 
 As of the date of this filing, Whitestone has not received consideration for its redemption of its equity investment in Pillarstone OP as required by the partnership agreement. The Company has filed a claim in the Pillarstone Bankruptcies for the value of its redemption claim along with interest and other costs. We intend to pursue collection of amounts due from Pillarstone OP through all means necessary and while we do not know the ultimate amount to be collected, we believe the amount will be in excess of the current carrying value of our equity investment in Pillarstone OP. 
 
 We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters are generally covered by insurance. While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.

 Overview 
 
 We are a fully-integrated real estate company that owns and operates commercial properties in culturally diverse markets in major metropolitan areas. Founded in 1998, we are internally managed with a portfolio of commercial properties in Texas and Arizona. 
 
 In October 2006, we adopted a strategic plan to acquire, redevelop, own and operate Community Centered Properties . We define Community Centered Properties as visibly located properties in established or developing culturally diverse neighborhoods in our target markets. We market, lease and manage our centers to match tenants with the shared needs of the surrounding neighborhood. Those needs may include specialty retail, grocery, restaurants and medical, educational and financial services. Our goal is for each property to become a Whitestone-branded retail community that serves a neighboring five-mile radius around our property. We employ and develop a diverse group of associates who understand the needs of our multi-cultural communities and tenants. 
 
 We serve as the general partner of Whitestone REIT Operating Partnership, L.P. (the Operating Partnership ), which was formed on December 31, 1998 as a Delaware limited partnership. We currently conduct substantially all of our operations and activities through the Operating Partnership. As the general partner of the Operating Partnership, we have the exclusive power to manage and conduct the business of the Operating Partnership, subject to certain customary exceptions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we wholly owned 55 commercial properties consisting of: 
 
 Consolidated Operating Portfolio 

50 wholly owned properties that meet our Community Centered Properties strategy containing approximately 4.9 million square feet of gross leasable area GLA and having a total carrying amount (net of accumulated depreciation) of 977.0 million; and 

Redevelopment, New Acquisitions Portfolio 

five parcels of land held for future development that meet our Community Centered Properties strategy having a total carrying value of 22.6 million. 

Acquired properties are categorized in the new acquisitions portfolio until the earlier of 90 occupancy or 18 months of ownership. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of 1,466 tenants. We have a diversified tenant base with our largest tenant comprising only 2.1 of our annualized rental revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Lease terms for our properties range from less than one year for smaller tenants to over 15 years for larger tenants. Our leases include minimum monthly lease payments and generally provide for tenant reimbursements for payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance. We completed 219 new and renewal leases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaling 735,695 square feet and approximately 78.2 million in total lease value. This compares to 223 new and renewal leases totaling 717,777 square feet and approximately 68.6 million in total lease value during the same period in 2023. 
 
 We employed 73 full-time employees as of September 30, 2024. As an internally managed REIT, we bear our own expenses of operations, including the salaries, benefits and other compensation of our employees, office expenses, legal, accounting, and investor relations expenses and other overhead costs.

Real Estate Partnership 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our ownership in Pillarstone OP no longer represents a majority interest. On January 25, 2024, we exercised our notice of redemption for substantially all of our investment in Pillarstone OP. As of the date of this filing, we have not received consideration for our redemption of our equity investment in Pillarstone OP as required by the partnership agreement. On March 4, 2024, Pillarstone Capital REIT Pillarstone REIT authorized and filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy of itself, Pillarstone OP, and all of its remaining special purpose entities in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the Pillarstone Bankruptcies ). We have filed a claim in the Pillarstone Bankruptcies for the value of our redemption claim along with interest and other costs. We intend to pursue collection of amounts due from Pillarstone OP through all means necessary, and, while we do not know the ultimate amount to be collected, we believe the amount will be in excess of the current carrying value of our equity investment in Pillarstone OP. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 We anticipate that the majority of our leases will continue to be triple-net leases or otherwise provide that tenants pay for increases in operating expenses and will contain provisions that we believe will mitigate the effect of inflation. In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than five years, which allows us to adjust rental rates to reflect inflation and other changing market conditions when the leases expire. Consequently, increases due to inflation, as well as ad valorem tax rate increases, generally do not currently have a significant adverse effect upon our operating results. 
 
 Rising Interest Rates 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 79.0 million, or approximately 12 of our outstanding debt, was subject to floating interest rates of Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 1.60 and a 10 basis point credit spread adjustment and not currently subject to a hedge. The impact of a 1 increase or decrease in interest rates on our non-hedged variable rate debt would result in a decrease or increase of annual net income of approximately 0.8 million, respectively. 
 
 How We Derive Our Revenue 
 
 Substantially all of our revenue is derived from rents received from leases at our properties. We had total revenues of approximately 38.6 million and 37.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 113.4 million and 109.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Rental Income 
 
 We expect our rental income to increase year-over-year due to the addition of properties and rent increases on renewal leases. The amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space, newly acquired properties with vacant space, and space available from unscheduled lease terminations. The amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates in our submarkets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an adjustment to rental revenue for bad debt, exclusive of straight-line rent reserve adjustments, resulting in a 0.3 million and 0.4 million decrease in revenue, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an adjustment to rental revenue for bad debt, exclusive of straight-line rent reserve adjustment, resulting in a 1.0 million decrease in revenue during both periods. The three months ended September 30, 2024 included 20 cash basis tenants, resulting in a decrease to rental revenue for straight-line rent adjustments of 0.1 million and a decrease to rental revenue for bad debt adjustments of 0.2 million.

Scheduled Lease Expirations 
 
 We tend to lease space to smaller businesses that desire shorter term leases. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 20 of our GLA was subject to leases that expire prior to December 31, 2025. Over the last three calendar years, we have renewed expiring leases with respect to approximately 68 of our GLA. We routinely seek to renew leases with our existing tenants prior to their expiration and typically begin discussions with a tenant as early as 24 months prior to the expiration date of the existing lease. Inasmuch as our early renewal program and other leasing and marketing efforts target these expiring leases, we work to re-lease most of that space prior to expiration of the leases. In the markets in which we operate, we obtain and analyze market rental rates through review of third-party publications, which provide market and submarket rental rate data and through inquiry of property owners and property management companies as to rental rates being quoted at properties that are located in close proximity to our properties and we believe display similar physical attributes as our nearby properties. We use this data to negotiate leases with new tenants and renew leases with our existing tenants at rates we believe to be competitive in the markets for our individual properties. Due to the short term nature of our leases, and based upon our analysis of market rental rates, we believe that, in the aggregate, our current leases are at market rates. Market conditions, including new supply of properties and competition, and macroeconomic conditions in our markets and nationally affecting tenant income, such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, tax rates, fuel and energy costs and other matters, could adversely impact our renewal rate and/or the rental rates we are able to negotiate. We continue to monitor our tenants operating performances as well as overall economic trends to evaluate any future negative impact on our renewal rates and rental rates, which could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our shareholders. 
 
 Acquisitions 
 
 We seek to grow our GLA through the acquisition of additional properties, and we are carefully evaluating development and redevelopment activities on a case-by-case basis. We have extensive relationships with community banks, attorneys, title companies, and others in the real estate industry, which we believe enables us to take advantage of these market opportunities and maintain an active acquisition pipeline. 
 
 Property Acquisitions, Dispositions and Development 
 
 We seek to acquire commercial properties in high-growth markets. Our acquisition targets are properties that fit our Community Centered Properties strategy. We may acquire properties in other high-growth cities in the future. As part of our ongoing commitment to our Community Centered Properties strategy and in pursuit of expanding our commercial property portfolio in high-growth markets, we have carefully evaluated and identified certain non-core properties for divestment, allowing us to reallocate resources towards acquiring properties that align more closely with our long-term growth objectives.

 The 1,250,000 increase in interest expense is attributable to higher interest rates, which led to an increase in our effective interest rate to 5.16 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4.99 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , resulting in a 816,000 increase in interest expense and an increase in our average outstanding notes payable balance of 11,442,000, resulting in a 434,000 increase in interest expense.

 On August 9, 2024, we completed the sale of Fountain Hills Plaza along with the adjacent parcel of development land, located in Phoenix, Arizona, for 21.3 million. We recorded a gain on sale of 3.6 million. On March 27, 2024, we completed the sale of Mercado at Scottsdale Ranch, located in Phoenix, Arizona, for an aggregate 26.5 million. We recorded a gain on sale of 6.6 million. On June 30, 2023, we completed the sale of Sunridge, located in Houston, Texas, for 6.7 million. We recorded a gain on sale of 5.0 million. On June 30, 2023, we completed the sale of Westchase, located in Houston, Texas, for 7.8 million. We recorded a gain on sale of 4.6 million. 

Deficit in earnings of real estate partnership. As of September 30, 2024, our ownership in Pillarstone OP no longer represents a majority interest. On January 25, 2024, we exercised our notice of redemption for substantially all of our investment in Pillarstone OP. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our estimated deficit in earnings from the real estate partnership, which was generated through our 81.4 ownership of Pillarstone OP up to the redemption date, amounted to 28,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 our estimated deficit in earnings from the real estate partnership was 1,627,000.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Funds From Operations FFO and Core FFO 
 
 The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT defines FFO as net income available to Whitestone REIT (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains or losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. We calculate FFO in a manner consistent with the NAREIT definition and also include adjustments for our unconsolidated real estate partnership. 
 
 Core Funds from Operations Core FFO is a non-GAAP measure. We define Core FFO as FFO excluding proxy contest costs. 
 
 Management uses FFO and Core FFO as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using GAAP net income alone as the primary measure of our operating performance. 
 
 Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Because real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself. In addition, securities analysts, investors and other interested parties use FFO as the primary metric for comparing the relative performance of equity REITs. 
 
 FFO and Core FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income or other measurements under GAAP, as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity. FFO and Core FFO do not reflect working capital changes, cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness. Although our calculation of FFO is consistent with that of NAREIT, there can be no assurance that FFO and Core FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. 
 
 Below are the calculations of FFO and Core FFO, along with the reconciliations to net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure (in thousands):

Property Net Operating Income NOI 
 
 Management believes that NOI is a useful measure of our property operating performance. We define NOI as operating revenues (rental and other revenues) less property and related expenses (property operation and maintenance and real estate taxes). Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. Because NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, deficit in earnings of real estate partnership, interest expense, interest, dividend and other investment income, provision for income taxes, (gain) loss on sale of properties, management fee, net of related expenses, loss on disposal of assets, and includes NOI of real estate partnership (pro rata) and net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. We use NOI to evaluate our operating performance since NOI allows us to evaluate the impact that factors such as occupancy levels, lease structure, lease rates and tenant base have on our results, margins and returns. In addition, management believes that NOI provides useful information to the investment community about our property and operating performance when compared to other REITs since NOI is generally recognized as a standard measure of property performance in the real estate industry. However, NOI should not be viewed as a measure of our overall financial performance since it does not reflect the level of capital expenditure and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, including general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, equity or deficit in earnings of real estate partnership, interest expense, interest, dividend and other investment income, provision for income taxes, (gain) loss on sale of properties, management fee, net of related expenses, and loss on disposal of assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of distributions to holders of our common shares and OP units, including those required to maintain our REIT status and satisfy our current quarterly distribution target of 0.12375 per common share and OP unit, recurring expenditures, such as repairs and maintenance of our properties, non-recurring expenditures, such as capital improvements and tenant improvements, debt service requirements, and, potentially, acquisitions of additional properties. 

48

Table of Contents 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash provided by operating activities was 40,156,000 and our total distributions were 18,565,000. Therefore, we had cash flow from operations in excess of distributions of approximately 21,591,000. We anticipate that cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing capacity under our 2022 Facility will provide adequate capital for our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, acquisitions and scheduled debt payments in the short term. We also believe that cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing capacity will allow us to make all distributions required for us to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. The funding for the Scottsdale Commons acquisition was provided by the 2022 Facility. 
 
 Our long-term capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longer-term debt agreements, development and redevelopment costs, and potential acquisitions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements with net cash from operations, long-term indebtedness, sales of common shares, issuance of OP units, sales of underperforming properties and non-core properties and other financing opportunities, including debt financing. We believe we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity. On March 5, 2024, the Company announced an increase to its quarterly distribution to 0.12375 per common share and OP unit, equal to a monthly distribution of 0.04125, beginning with the April 2024 distribution. The Board will regularly reassess the dividend in light of economic conditions. As of September 30, 2024, subject to any potential future paydowns in the borrowing base, we have 121.0 million remaining availability under the 2022 Revolver. 
 
 Our ability to access the capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about our Company. In light of the dynamics in the capital markets impacted by macro economic factors and economic uncertainty, our access to capital may be diminished. Despite these potential challenges, we believe we have sufficient access to capital for the foreseeable future, but we can provide no assurance that such capital will be available to us in the future on attractive terms or at all. 
 
 On May 20, 2022, our universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-264881) was declared effective by the SEC (the Registration Statement ), which registers the issuance and sale by us of up to 500 million in securities from time to time, including common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, depositary shares and subscription rights. 
 
 On September 9, 2022, we entered into eleven equity distribution agreements with certain sales agents names therein for an at-the-market equity distribution program (the 2022 equity distribution agreements providing for the issuance and sale of up to an aggregate of 100 million of the Company s common shares pursuant to our Registration Statement. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors determined by us from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of our common shares, capital needs and our determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for us, and will be made in transactions that will be deemed to be at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). We have no obligation to sell any of our common shares and can at any time suspend offers under the 2022 equity distribution agreements or terminate the 2022 equity distribution agreements. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 579,964 common shares under the 2022 equity distribution agreements, with net proceeds to us of approximately 7.6 million. In connection with such sales, we paid compensation of approximately 116,000 to the sales agents. For both the three and nine months ended September 2023, we did not sell shares under the 2022 equity distribution agreements. 
 
 To the extent we sell shares in the future under the 2022 equity distribution agreements, we anticipate using net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions of additional properties, the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, the expansion, redevelopment and/or re-tenanting of properties in our portfolio, working capital and other general purposes. 
 
 We expect that our rental income will increase as we continue to acquire additional properties, subsequently increasing our cash flows generated from operating activities. We intend to finance the continued acquisition of such additional properties through equity issuances and through debt financing.

Table of Contents 

Our capital structure includes non-recourse mortgage debt that we have assumed or originated on certain properties. We may hedge the future cash flows of certain variable rate debt transactions principally through interest rate swaps with major financial institutions. See Note 8 (Derivatives and Hedging Activities) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our current cash flow hedges. 
 
 As discussed in Note 2 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, pursuant to the terms of our 15.1 million 4.99 Note, due January 6, 2024 (see Note 7 (Debt)) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), which is collateralized by our Anthem Marketplace property, we were required by the lenders thereunder to establish a cash management account controlled by the lenders to collect all amounts generated by our Anthem Marketplace property in order to collateralize such promissory note. The note was paid off in January 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had no restricted cash. 
 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
 
 We had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately 2,534,000 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 4,640,000 on December 31, 2023. Sources and uses of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

On June 21, 2024, Whitestone REIT, operating through its subsidiaries Whitestone Strand LLC, Whitestone Las Colinas Village LLC, and Whitestone Seville, LLC (collectively, the Borrower ), entered into a loan agreement (the Loan Agreement with Nationwide Life Insurance Company (the Lender for a mortgage loan in the principal amount of 56,340,000 (the Loan ). 
 
 The Loan provides for a fixed interest rate of 6.23 per annum. Payments commence on August 1, 2024, and are due on the first day of each calendar month thereafter through July 1, 2031, with interest-only payments for the first 36 months. Monthly payments consist of principal and interest based on a 30-year amortization schedule beginning on August 1, 2027. The Loan may be prepaid in full but not in part, provided that, as conditions precedent, Borrower: (i) gives Lender not less than fifteen (15) days prior notice of Borrower s intention to prepay the Loan; (ii) pays to Lender the prepayment premium as set forth in the Loan Agreement, if any, then due and payable to Lender; and (iii) pays to Lender all other amounts then due under the loan documents. No prepayment premium is required for prepayments in full made on or after six months prior to the maturity date. 
 
 The Loan is a non-recourse loan secured by three of the Company s properties including their related equipment, fixtures, personal property, and other assets, and a limited carve-out guarantee by the Company s operating partnership. 
 
 The loan documents contain customary terms and conditions, including without limitation affirmative and negative covenants such as information reporting and insurance requirements. The loan documents also contain customary events of default, including defaults in the payment of principal or interest, defaults in compliance with the covenants, and bankruptcy or other insolvency events. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Lender is entitled to accelerate all obligations of the Borrower. The Lender will also be entitled to receive the entire unpaid principal balance at a default rate. 
 
 The Loan proceeds will be used to pay down the Borrower s existing floating rate indebtedness. 
 
 On September 16, 2022 we, through our Operating Partnership, entered into an unsecured credit facility (the 2022 Facility pursuant to that certain Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, by and among the Operating Partnership, the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors signatory thereto, the lenders party thereto, Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent ), Truist Bank, as syndication agent, and BMO Capital Markets Corp., Truist Bank, Capital One, National Association, and U.S. Bank National Association, as co-lead arrangers and joint book runners (as amended from time to time, the Credit Agreement ). The 2022 Facility replaced the Company s previous unsecured revolving credit facility, dated January 31, 2019. 
 
 On October 7, 2024, we, through our Operating Partnership, entered into the First Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Incremental Term Loan Joinder (the Amendment among the Operating Partnership, the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors signatory thereto, the Administrative Agent, and L/C Issuer and Associated Bank, National Association, which amends the Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Amendment, among other things, establishes the Series One Incremental Term Loan (defined below) consistent with the existing Term Loan (defined below). The Series One Incremental Term Loan accrues interest (at the Operating Partnership s option) at a Base Rate (defined below) or Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin based upon the Operating Partnership s then existing total leverage and is subject to adjustment as set forth in the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Operating Partnership entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on the Series One Incremental Term Loan at 3.665 plus bank credit spreads (that are currently 1.5 , through January 31, 2028), or an all-in rate of 5.165 . 
 
 The 2022 Facility is comprised of the following three tranches: 

250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of September 16, 2026 (the 2022 Revolver 

265.0 million unsecured term loan with a maturity date of January 31, 2028 (the Term Loan 

20.0 million unsecured term loan with a maturity date of January 31, 2028 (the Series One Incremental Term Loan ), effective October 7, 2024. 

Borrowings under the 2022 Facility accrue interest (at the Operating Partnership s option) at a Base Rate or Adjusted Term SOFR plus an applicable margin based upon our then existing total leverage as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Base Rate means, for any day, the higher of: (a) the Administrative Agent s prime commercial rate, (b) the sum of (i) the rate per annum equal to the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for such day, plus (ii) 0.50 , or (c) the sum of (i) Adjusted Term SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect on such day plus (ii) 1.10 . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the 2022 Revolver was 6.80 . In addition, we entered into interest rate swaps to fix the interest rates on the Term Loan. The Term Loan with the swaps has the following interest rates: 

2.16 plus spreads ranging from 1.35 to 2 , through October 28, 2022 

2.80 plus spreads ranging from 1.35 to 2 , from October 29, 2022 through January 31, 2024 

3.42 plus spreads ranging from 1.35 to 2 , from February 1, 2024 through January 31, 2028 

As of September 30, 2024, the Term Loan with the swaps had a spread of 1.40 . 
 
 The 2022 Facility also has a pricing provision where the applicable margin can be adjusted by an aggregate 0.02 per annum based on the Company s performance on certain sustainability performance targets. 
 
 The 2022 Facility includes an accordion feature that allows the Operating Partnership to increase the borrowing capacity by an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 200.0 million, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. As of September 30, 2024, subject to any potential future paydowns or increases in the borrowing base, we have 121.0 million remaining availability under the 2022 Revolver. As of September 30, 2024, 394.0 million was drawn on the 2022 Facility and our unused borrowing capacity was 121.0 million, assuming that we use the proceeds of the 2022 Facility to acquire properties, or to repay debt on properties, that are eligible to be included in the unsecured borrowing base.

The Company, each direct and indirect material subsidiary of the Operating Partnership and any other subsidiary of the Operating Partnership that is a guarantor under any unsecured ratable debt will serve as a guarantor for funds borrowed by the Operating Partnership under the 2022 Facility. The 2022 Facility contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants including, without limitation, information reporting requirements, limitations on investments, acquisitions, loans and advances, mergers, consolidations and sales, incurrence of liens, dividends and restricted payments. In addition, the 2022 Facility contains certain financial covenants including the following: 

maximum total indebtedness to total asset value ratio of 0.60 to 1.00; 

maximum secured debt to total asset value ratio of 0.40 to 1.00; 

minimum EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization or extraordinary items) to fixed charges ratio of 1.50 to 1.00; 

maximum secured recourse debt to total asset value ratio of 0.15 to 1.00; 

maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth (adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization) of 449 million plus 75 of the net proceeds from additional equity offerings (as defined therein); 

minimum adjusted property net operating income to implied unencumbered debt service of 1.50 to 1.00; and 

maximum unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset pool value of 0.60 to 1.00. 

On March 22, 2019, we, through our Operating Partnership, entered into a Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement (as amended from time to time, the Note Agreement together with certain subsidiary guarantors as initial guarantor parties thereto (the Subsidiary Guarantors and The Prudential Insurance Company of America and the various other purchasers named therein (collectively, the Purchasers providing for the issuance and sale of 100 million of senior unsecured notes of the Operating Partnership, of which (i) 50 million are designated as 5.09 Series A Senior Notes due March 22, 2029 (the Series A Notes and (ii) 50 million are designated as 5.17 Series B Senior Notes due March 22, 2029 (the Series B Notes and, together with the Series A Notes, the Notes pursuant to a private placement that closed on March 22, 2019 (the Private Placement ). Obligations under the Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and by the Subsidiary Guarantors. 
 
 On December 16, 2022, we, through our Operating Partnership, amended the Note Agreement, pursuant to the terms and conditions of that certain Amendment No. 1 to Note Purchase and Guaranty Agreement, by and among the Company and the Operating Partnership, together with certain subsidiary guarantors as initial guarantor parties thereto and The Prudential Insurance Company of America and the various other purchasers named therein, for the purposes of conforming certain covenants and defined terms contained in the Note Agreement with the 2022 Facility. 
 
 The principal of the Series A Notes began to amortize on March 22, 2023, with annual principal payments of approximately 7.1 million. The principal of the Series B Notes will begin to amortize on March 22, 2025 with annual principal payments of 10.0 million. The Notes will pay interest quarterly on the 22nd day of March, June, September and December in each year until maturity. 
 
 The Operating Partnership may prepay at any time all, or from time to time part of, the Notes, in an amount not less than 1,000,000 in the case of a partial prepayment, at 100 of the principal amount so prepaid, plus a make-whole amount. The make-whole amount is equal to the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments with respect to the Notes being prepaid over the aggregate principal amount of such Notes (as described in the Note Agreement). In addition, in connection with a Change of Control (as defined in the Note Agreement), the Operating Partnership is required to offer to prepay the Notes at 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

The Note Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants, terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type and substantially similar to the Operating Partnership s existing senior revolving credit facility, including limitations on liens, incurrence of investments, acquisitions, loans and advances and restrictions on dividends and certain other restricted payments. In addition, the Note Agreement contains certain financial covenants substantially similar to the Operating Partnership s existing senior revolving credit facility, including the following: 

maximum total indebtedness to total asset value ratio of 0.60 to 1.00; 

maximum secured debt to total asset value ratio of 0.40 to 1.00; 

minimum EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization or extraordinary items) to fixed charges ratio of 1.50 to 1.00; 

maximum secured recourse debt to total asset value ratio of 0.15 to 1.00; 

maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth (adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization) of 75 of the Company's total net worth as of December 31, 2021 plus 75 of the net proceeds from additional equity offerings (as defined therein); and 

minimum adjusted property NOI to implied unencumbered debt service ratio of 1.50 to 1.00. 

In addition, the Note Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring that maximum unsecured indebtedness not exceed the ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset pool of 0.60 to 1.00. That covenant is substantially similar to the borrowing base concept contained in the Operating Partnership s existing senior revolving credit facility. 
 
 The Note Agreement also contains default provisions, including defaults for non-payment, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, non-performance of covenants, cross-defaults with other indebtedness and guarantor defaults. The occurrence of an event of default under the Note Agreement could result in the Purchasers accelerating the payment of all obligations under the Notes. The financial and restrictive covenants and default provisions in the Note Agreement are substantially similar to those contained in the Operating Partnership s existing credit facility. 
 
 Net proceeds from the Private Placement were used to refinance existing indebtedness. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Notes were sold in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our 153.72 million in secured debt was collateralized by five properties with a carrying value of 242.7 million. Our loans contain restrictions that would require the payment of prepayment penalties for the acceleration of outstanding debt and are secured by deeds of trust on certain of our properties and by assignment of the rents and leases associated with those properties. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all loan covenants. 
 
 Refer to Note 7 (Debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 We continually evaluate our properties performance and value. We may determine it is in our shareholders best interest to invest capital in properties that we believe have potential for increasing value. We also may have unexpected capital expenditures or improvements for our existing assets. Additionally, we intend to continue investing in similar properties outside of the markets on which we focus in cities with exceptional demographics to diversify market risk, and we may incur significant capital expenditures or make improvements in connection with any properties we may acquire.

Distributions 
 
 U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually to its shareholders at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income that it does not distribute. We currently, and intend to continue to, accrue distributions quarterly and make distributions in three monthly installments following the end of each quarter. For a discussion of our cash flow as compared to dividends, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 
 The timing and frequency of our distributions are authorized and declared by our Board of Trustees in exercise of its business judgment based upon a number of factors, including: 

our funds from operations; 

our debt service requirements; 

our capital expenditure requirements for our properties; 

our taxable income, combined with the annual distribution requirements necessary to maintain REIT qualification; 

requirements of Maryland law; 

our overall financial condition; and 

other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Trustees. 

Any distributions we make will be at the discretion of our Board of Trustees and we cannot provide assurance that our distributions will be made or sustained in the future. 
 
 On March 5, 2024, the Company announced an increase to its quarterly distribution to 0.12375 per common share and OP unit, equal to a monthly distribution of 0.04125, beginning with the April 2024 distribution. The Board will continue to regularly reassess the dividend level.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid distributions to our common shareholders and OP unit holders of 18.6 million, compared to 18.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Common shareholders and OP unit holders receive monthly distributions. Payments of distributions are declared quarterly and paid monthly.

Taxes 
 
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 1999. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We believe that we are organized and operate in a manner to qualify and be taxed as a REIT, and we intend to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 Our properties are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which our operations are conducted. From our inception, we have incurred no significant environmental costs, accrued liabilities or expenditures to mitigate or eliminate future environmental contamination. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Guarantees. We may guarantee the debt of a real estate partnership primarily because it allows the real estate partnership to obtain funding at a lower cost than could be obtained otherwise. This results in a higher return for the real estate partnership on its investment, and a higher return on our investment in the real estate partnership. We may receive a fee from the real estate partnership for providing the guarantee. Additionally, when we issue a guarantee, the terms of the real estate partnership s partnership agreement typically provide that we may receive indemnification from the real estate partnership or have the ability to increase our ownership interest. See Note 6 (Investment in Real Estate Partnership) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information related to our former guarantee of the real estate partnership s debt, which is no longer in effect.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Our future income, cash flows and fair value relevant to our financial instruments depend upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange rate or commodity price risk. The principal market risk to which we are exposed is the risk related to interest rate fluctuations. Many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk. Our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve this objective, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for our borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable. 
 
 All of our financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes. 
 
 Fixed Interest Rate 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 555.6 million, or approximately 88 of our total outstanding debt, was subject to fixed interest rates, which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Although a change in the market interest rates affects the fair market value of our fixed interest rate debt, it does not impact net income to shareholders or cash flows. Our total outstanding fixed interest rate debt had an average effective interest rate as of September 30, 2024 of approximately 4.87 per annum with scheduled maturities ranging from 2024 to 2031. See Note 7 (Debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail. Holding other variables constant, a 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would cause a 14.3 million decline or increase, respectively, in the fair value for our fixed rate debt. 
 
 Variable Interest Rate Debt 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 79.0 million, or approximately 12 of our outstanding debt, was subject to floating interest rates of SOFR plus 1.50 to 2.10 and not currently subject to a hedge. The impact of a 1 increase or decrease in interest rates on our non-hedged variable rate debt would result in a decrease or increase of annual net income of approximately 0.8 million, respectively. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Credit risk may be increased as a result of macroeconomic factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and financial institution disruptions. Actions taken by the U.S. and international governments to decrease the impact of inflation, including rising interest rates, may result in a continued decline in global economic activity generally, and may adversely affect the financial condition of our tenants in particular. Although the full extent of the adverse impacts on our tenants cannot be predicted, in future periods we may experience reductions in on-time payments or closures of tenants businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of the Company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive and financial officers have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters are generally covered by insurance. While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
 
 As disclosed in Note 17 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we are engaged in certain legal proceedings, and the disclosure set forth in Note 17 is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 There has been no material change in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 other than the following. 
 
 Risk associated with the Kroger acquisition of Albertsons. 
 
 On October 14, 2022, Kroger Co. Kroger announced its intention to acquire Albertsons Companies, Inc. Albertsons ). In connection with obtaining the regulatory clearance necessary to close the transaction, C S Wholesale Grocers has entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 579 stores. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 3 grocery stores owned by Albertsons as the Company's tenants, and 2 grocery stores in shadow space adjacent to Company properties. If the acquisition is approved by regulating authorities, any of the Albertsons' stores currently leasing from Whitestone REIT could be purchased by C S Wholesale Grocers, and such assignment could potentially result in adverse changes to the traffic and profitability of the shopping center in which it is located.
