of the voting securities of such company. We are deemed to be an affiliate
of a company if we own or more of the voting securities of such company. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of our
investments were Non-Controlled/Non-Affiliated investments.

based on our net asset value per share. 

On August 9, 2024, the Board approved the renewal
of the Investment Advisory Agreement which automatically renews for successive one-year periods each September 17th; provided that such
continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the vote of the Board or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities of the Company and the vote of a majority of the Independent Directors, in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. 

Base Management Fee 

The base management fee is calculated at a maximum
annual rate of of the average of the weighted average (based on the number of shares outstanding each day in the quarter) of our
gross assets (including uninvested cash and cash equivalents) at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters.
The base management fee for any partial quarter is pro-rated based on the number of days actually elapsed in that quarter relative to
the total number of days in such quarter. On August 13, 2021, the Board agreed to make investments rather than gross assets the basis
for their fee to be more in line with the waivers implemented for management fees. 

Gross management fees for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 were thousand and thousand, respectively. Net management fees for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024 were thousand and thousand, respectively. The Investment Advisor elected to waive a portion of the management
fee and charged management fees on investments rather than gross assets. 

Gross management fees for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023 were thousand and thousand, respectively. Net management fees for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 were thousand and thousand, respectively. The Investment Advisor elected to waive a portion of the management
fee and charged management fees on investments rather than gross assets. 

Incentive Fee 

The Incentive Fee will consist of an income-based
component and a capital gains component. 

The portion of the incentive fee based on income
is determined and paid quarterly in arrears commencing with the first calendar quarter following the Company s election to be regulated
as a BDC, and equals of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of a quarterly (or annually) hurdle rate. 
There are no catch-up provisions applicable to income-based incentive fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. 

35 

of cumulative realized capital gains from the date of the Company s
election to be regulated as a BDC to the end of each calendar year, less cumulative net realized capital losses and unrealized capital
depreciation. We will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation. Also, it should
be noted that while we accrue the capital incentive fee quarterly, the expense will fluctuate with the Company s overall investment
results and the expense will be finalized at year end. 

In determining the capital gains incentive fee
payable to the Investment Advisor, we calculate the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital
losses from the date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC, and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of
the date of the calculation, as applicable, with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio. For this purpose, cumulative aggregate
realized capital gains, if any, equals the sum of the differences between the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the original
cost of such investment since our inception. Cumulative aggregate realized capital losses equals the sum of the amounts by which the net
sales price of each investment, when sold, is less than the original cost of such investment since our inception. Aggregate unrealized

Overview 

We are a financial services company that
primarily invests in syndicated corporate bank loans, bonds, other debt securities, and structured products. We are an externally
managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC and has elected to be
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code. We were formed on June 3,
2020 as a Delaware limited liability company under the name MSC Capital LLC. MSC Capital LLC was formed by Steele Creek Investment
Management LLC, Moelis Asset and two affiliates. On October 7, 2020, MSC Capital LLC converted to a Maryland corporation (the
 Conversion ), named Steele Creek Capital Corporation. On September 3, 2020, we formed a wholly-owned consolidated
special purpose financing vehicle, Steele Creek Capital Funding I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. On August 28, 2024, we
formed a wholly-owned special purpose financing vehicle, Steele Creek Capital Funding II, LLC Funding II ), a Delaware
limited liability company. Funding II did not become operational until October 2024. 

Our investment objective is to generate high current
income by investing primarily in fixed income instruments, including broadly syndicated bank loans, structured products, mezzanine financings
and senior secured bonds. We provide moderate liquidity to our shareholders by offering a quarterly share repurchase program. As of September
30, 2024, approximately 881,463 shares have been tendered through the share repurchase program. Broadly syndicated loans are generally
more liquid than directly originated investments and may provide more attractive financing terms than less liquid assets. Mezzanine financings
are generally unrated or below investment grade rated investments that have greater credit and liquidity risk than more highly rated debt
obligations. Moreover, mezzanine financings are generally unsecured and subordinate to other obligations of the obligor and are subject
to many of the same risks as those associated with high-yield debt securities. 

Revenues 

We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest
and fee income on debt investments we hold and capital gains, if any, on investments. We generally expect our debt investments to bear
interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate LIBOR or Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly, quarterly or semi-annually.
In some instances, we expect to receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances.
In addition, we may receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume
of these repayments is expected to fluctuate significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity is also expected to reflect the
proceeds of sales of securities. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence
fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. 

47 

Expenses 

Our primary operating expenses include the payment
of fees to our Investment Advisor under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the Administration
Agreement and other operating costs described below. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions,
including: 

our initial organization costs incurred prior to the commencement of our operations;

the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 

the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities, including in connection with the Private Offering; 

distribution and shareholder servicing fees payable to our dealer manager and financial intermediaries; 

fees payable to third parties relating to making investments, including our Investment Advisor s or its affiliates travel expenses, research costs and out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments;

48 

From time to time, the Administrator or its affiliates
may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts
paid on our behalf under the Administration Agreement. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our stockholders. 

Our Investment Advisor is authorized to determine
the broker to be used for each portfolio transaction. In selecting brokers to execute transactions, the Investment Advisor need not solicit
competitive bids and does not have an obligation to seek the lowest available commission cost. In selecting brokers, the Investment Advisor
may or may not negotiate execution only commission rates and thus we may be deemed to be paying for other services provided
by the broker that are included in the commission rate. In negotiating commission rates, the Investment Advisor will take into account
the financial stability and reputation of the broker and the brokerage, research and other services provided to us, the Investment Advisor
and other customers of the Investment Advisor and its affiliates by such broker, even though we may not, in any particular instance, be
the direct or indirect beneficiaries of the research or other services provided and the management fee payable to the Investment Advisor
is not reduced because it receives such services. In addition, the Investment Advisor may direct commissions to certain brokers that on
the foregoing basis may furnish other services to us, the Investment Advisor and other customers of the Investment Advisor and its affiliates,
such as telephone lines, news and quotation equipment, electronic office equipment, account record keeping and clerical services, trading
software, financial publications and economic consulting services. As a result of the brokerage practices described above, the levels
of commission paid, and prices paid or received by us in portfolio transactions may be less favorable than in portfolio transactions effected
on a best price and execution basis.

Participating Financial Intermediaries

of the Shareholder Servicing Fee is to reimburse our Dealer Manager for costs incurred by selected Financial Intermediaries and investment
representatives for providing ongoing shareholder services. The Shareholder Servicing Fee is paid pursuant to a Servicing Plan adopted
by the Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation
of the Servicing Plan or in any agreements entered into in connection therewith. The Servicing Plan will remain in effect for so long
as such continuance is reapproved annually by the Board. 

The Investment Advisor or its affiliates, in Investment
Advisor s discretion and from their own resources, will pay additional compensation to our Dealer Manager in connection with the
sale and servicing of shares Additional Compensation ). In return for the Additional Compensation, the Company may receive

Current Market Conditions 

The syndicated loan market was active closing
out the third quarter with over 200BN of issuance, despite the summer slowdown and short period of volatility stemming from the weaker
than expected jobs report in August. Notably, ~20 of volume consisted of M A and LBO loans, which is up over 70 since Q2 and the
highest recorded volume since Q1 2022 according to CreditSights. Strong CLO creation continued to meet supply leading to a relatively
flat technical backdrop. The Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan index average bid price was little changed for the quarter at 95.62, from 95.68
in Q2. The index returned 2.08 in the quarter driven by the interest component and rating upgrades to downgrades for the index constituents
were 0.56:1 vs. 0.84:1 in Q2.

Investment Income 

Investment income is recorded on the accrual basis
to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Where applicable, OID and purchased discounts and premiums are accreted
into interest income using the effective interest method. Loan origination fees are deferred and accreted into interest income using the
effective interest method. We record prepayment premiums on loans and other investments as interest income when such amounts are received.
Investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 3,322 thousand and 10,295 thousand, respectively.
Investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 3,589 thousand and 10,061 thousand, respectively. 

Total Expenses 

Total expenses for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024 of approximately 2,398 thousand and 7,215 thousand, respectively. Total expenses for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 of approximately 2,333 thousand and 6,470 thousand, respectively. Total expenses include management, incentive, audit
and tax preparation fees, organizational costs, offering costs, interest and debt financing costs, directors fees, administration
expenses and other general and administrative expenses. Expenses are recognized on an accrual basis. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Investment Advisor waived 129 thousand and 705 thousand of management fees and did not waive any income incentive fees,
respectively. The actions taken by the Investment Advisor effectively reduced total expenses incurred by the Company for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 2,398 thousand to approximately 2,269 thousand and 7,215 thousand to approximately
 6,510 thousand, respectively. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023, the Investment Advisor waived 68 thousand and 495 thousand of management fees and zero and 8 thousand of income incentive
fees, respectively. The actions taken by the Investment Advisor effectively reduced total expenses incurred by the Company for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of approximately 2,333 thousand to approximately 2,265 thousand and approximately 6,470 thousand
to approximately 5,967 thousand, respectively. 

Net Realized Gain and Losses on Investments 

Sales and repayments of investments during the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 72,659 thousand and 244,590 thousand, respectively, resulting in
net realized loss of approximately 53 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a net realized loss of 1,682 thousand
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Sales and repayments of investments during the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled approximately 51,473 thousand and 139,561 thousand, respectively, resulting in
net realized gain of approximately 1 thousand and net realized loss of approximately 1,418 thousand, respectively. 

54 

Net Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation
on Investments 

Unrealized depreciation for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 402 thousand. Unrealized appreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately
 385 thousand, respectively. Unrealized appreciation during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled approximately 1,851
thousand and 5,312 thousand, respectively. This activity reflects the changes in fair value of investments as determined in compliance
with the Investment Advisor s valuation policy. 

Taxes 

We elected to be treated, and intend to qualify
annually to maintain our election to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax election, we must, among
other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements. We also must annually distribute
dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally
at least equal to 90 of the sum of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term
capital losses, or investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. 

Although not required for us to maintain our RIC
tax status, in order to avoid the imposition of a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for
U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the Excise Tax Avoidance
Requirement. 

Because federal income tax regulations differ
from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and net realized gain recognized for
financial reporting purposes. Differences between tax regulations and GAAP may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified
among capital accounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect their appropriate tax character. Temporary differences arise
when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. 

We have formed and expect to continue to form
certain taxable subsidiaries, including the Taxable Subsidiary, which are taxed as corporations. These taxable subsidiaries allow us to
hold equity securities of certain portfolio companies treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes while facilitating
our ability to qualify as a RIC under the Code. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We generate cash primarily from the net proceeds
of any offering of shares of our common stock and from cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments
and proceeds from sales of our investments. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings from banks and issuances
of senior securities, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of the Private Offering. Our primary use of cash is investments
in portfolio companies, payments of our expenses and payment of cash distributions to our stockholders. 

Capital Contributions 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company issued and sold 27,486 and 158,974 shares of Common Stock with a par value of 0.001 per share for an aggregate
offering price of 265 thousand and 1,534 thousand, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company
issued and sold 54,347 and 245,507 shares of Common Stock with a par value of 0.001 per share for an aggregate offering price of 523
thousand and 2,274 thousand, respectively. 

The sale of its common stock was made pursuant
to subscription agreements between the Company and the investors, and the issuance of the common stock was exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof and Regulation D thereunder. 

55 

Our shares of common stock constitute illiquid
investments for which there is not, and will likely not be, a secondary market at any time prior to a public offering and listing of our
shares on a national securities exchange. There can be no guarantee that we will conduct a public offering and list our shares on a national
securities exchange. Investment in the Company is suitable only for sophisticated investors and requires the financial ability and willingness
to be exposed to higher liquidity risk than would be the case were the securities publicly listed
and actively traded. 

We provide moderate liquidity to our shareholders
by offering a quarterly share repurchase program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 629,851 shares
and 743,479 shares were tendered, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 15,844 shares
and 129,843 shares were tendered, respectively. 

In September 2024, the Company adopted a dividend
reinvestment plan DRIP that provides for the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions on behalf of its stockholders
that elect to participate in such plan. When the Company declares a dividend or distribution, the Company s current stockholders
who have opted in to the DRIP will have their cash dividend automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s
common stock. Existing investors were given the option to be enrolled into the DRIP, any investor that did not enroll will continue
to receive their dividends in cash. All new stockholders will automatically be enrolled in the DRIP unless they opt out. Newly issued
shares are valued based upon the month end closing price prior to payment of the dividend. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, no shares were reinvested. 

As of November 12, 2024, 5,764,244 shares of
the Company s Common Stock was issued and outstanding. 

Borrowings 

October 13, 2020, we entered into a two-year secured
revolving Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with BNP Paribas BNP as lender and administrative agent
(the BNP Credit Facility providing a maximum of 45,000 thousand Maximum Facility Amount to Steele Creek
Capital Funding I, LLC Funding I ). The Company created a wholly owned subsidiary, Funding I, which it will use to hold
the Company s investments, and a first priority continuing security interest in, to and under each investment, all underlying investments
and underlying assets has been granted to BNP to be used as collateral for the BNP Credit Facility. During the BNP Credit Facility s
revolving period, it bears interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We believe that our capital resources will provide us with the flexibility
to take advantage of market opportunities when they arise. 

Funding I is required to pay an administrative
agent fee equal to 25 thousand per annum and a structuring fee equal to 0.25 of the Maximum Facility Amount paid on the twelve-month
anniversary of the closing date. Additionally, an unused fee is payable quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to 0.70 on the actual
daily unused amount greater than 20 of the Maximum Facility Amount under the BNP Credit Facility from April 13, 2021 to the end of the
revolving period. 

On April 29, 2021, Funding I executed an amendment
to the BNP Credit Facility. The amendment solidified the LIBOR transition to SOFR for the planned discontinuation of LIBOR. The amendment
also increased the Individual Lender Maximum Facility Amount from 45,000 thousand to 80,000 thousand. 

On October 28, 2021, the Company executed an additional
amendment to the Credit Agreement. Material amendments included at this time include the revolving period being extended 36 months, from
12 months to 48 months and the interest rate being reduced from LIBOR plus 175 basis points to LIBOR plus 140 basis points. The advance
rate was increased from 67.5 to 70 and expanded to include a triple C bucket with a 60 advance rate. The structuring fee was increased
from 0.25 of the Maximum Facility Amount to 0.50 of the Maximum Facility Amount and will be paid in three equal installments (December
2021, December 2022, and December 2023). Updates were made to allow for more flexibility to move capital out of the facility subject to
certain covenants. Except as described above, all other terms and provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. 

On March 22, 2022, the Company amended the Credit
Agreement between Steele Creek Capital Funding I, LLC, BNP Paribas, and the Company as dated October 13, 2020 and as previously amended.
Material amendments to the Agreement include the interest rate being converted from LIBOR plus 140 basis points to SOFR plus 140 basis
points plus 15 basis points. In addition, the Individual Lender Maximum Facility Amount increased from 80,000 thousand to 95,000 thousand
and the language and requirements related to the Agreed Upon Procedures provided by independent accountants were amended to be more appropriate
for the underlying collateral. 

56 

On August 23, 2022, the Company amended the Credit
Agreement between Steele Creek Capital Funding I, LLC, BNP Paribas, and the Company as dated October 13, 2020 and as previously amended.
This amendment contained certain conforming changes that are not material. 

On July 10, 2023, the Company amended the Credit
Agreement between Steele Creek Capital Funding I, LLC, BNP Paribas, and the Company as dated October 13, 2020 and as previously amended.
This amendment contained certain conforming changes that are not material. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, we had an average of 86,805 thousand and 86,122 thousand outstanding under the BNP Credit Facility, respectively. For the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had an average of 82,142 thousand and 81,652 thousand outstanding under the BNP Credit
Facility, respectively. 

The revolving period of the BNP Credit Facility
ends on October 28, 2025, unless terminated earlier by the Company. The maturity date of the BNP Credit Facility is the earliest to occur
of (a) October 28, 2026, and (b) the date on which the BNP gives notice to the Company, the Collateral Manager and the Equityholder following
the occurrence of and during the continuation of an Event of Default that the entire Outstanding Principal Amount of Loans shall be due
and payable. The stated maturity of October 28, 2026 may not be extended. 

Distribution Policy 

To the extent that we have income available, we
intend to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Our quarterly dividends, if any, will be determined by our Board. Any dividends
to our stockholders will be declared out of assets legally available for distribution. 

We intend for the Company to elect to be treated,
and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code. To obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment, among other things, we must
distribute dividends to our stockholders in respect of each taxable year of an amount at least equal to 90 of the sum of our net ordinary
income and net short-term capital gains in excess of our net long-term capital losses investment company taxable income ),
determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we currently intend
to distribute dividends to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of: (1) 98 of our
net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for such calendar year; (2) 98.2 of our capital gains in excess
of capital losses capital gain net income ), adjusted for certain ordinary losses, generally for the one-year period ending
on October 31 of such calendar year; and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding years that were not distributed
during such years and on which we previously paid no U.S. federal income tax. 

We currently intend to distribute net capital
gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually out of the assets legally
available for such distributions. However, we may decide in the future to retain such capital gains for investment, incur a corporate-level
tax on such capital gains, and elect to treat such capital gains as deemed distributions to you. If this happens, you will be treated
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as if you had received an actual distribution of the capital gains that we retain and reinvested
the net after tax proceeds in us. In this situation, you would be eligible to claim a tax credit equal to your allocable share of the
tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to you. We cannot assure you that we will achieve results that will permit us to pay
any cash distributions, and if we issue senior securities, we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing so would cause us
to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the 1940 Act or if such distributions are limited by the terms of any of our
borrowings. 

Asset Coverage 

In accordance with the 1940 Act, the Company has
historically only been allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200 
after such borrowing, permitting the Company to borrow up to one dollar for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity.
 Asset coverage generally refers to a company s total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented
by senior securities, as defined in the 1940 Act, divided by total senior securities representing indebtedness and, if applicable,
preferred stock. Senior securities for this purpose includes borrowings from banks or other lenders, debt securities and
preferred stock. 

57 

On March 23, 2018, the SBCAA was signed into
law. The SBCAA, among other things, modifies the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act to reduce the required asset coverage ratio applicable
to BDCs from 200 to 150 subject to certain approval, time and disclosure requirements (including either stockholder approval or approval
of a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the BDC and who have no financial interest in the proposal). On October 5,
2020, the Board and the Members of MSC Capital LLC voted to approve the adoption of the reduced asset coverage ratio. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the
Company had total senior securities of 84,686 thousand and 86,316 thousand, respectively, consisting of borrowings under the Credit
Facility, and had asset coverage ratios of 165.1 and 171.7 , respectively. For a discussion of certain risks associated with
the reduction of the required minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company, see Risk Factors Risks Related
to Our Business and Structure The SBCAA allows us to incur additional leverage, which may increase the risk of investing with
us. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Valuation Procedures 

Under procedures established by our Board and
in accordance with the 1940 Act, our Investment Advisor values investments for which market quotations are readily available at such market
quotations. Assets listed on an exchange will be valued at their last sales prices as reported to the consolidated quotation service at
4:00 P.M. eastern time on the date of determination. If no such sales of such securities occurred, such securities will be valued at the
mean between the last available bid and ask prices as reported by an independent, third-party pricing service on the date of determination.
Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available will be valued at fair value,
subject at all times to the oversight and approval of our Board. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and
estimates, although we will also engage independent valuation providers to review the valuation of each portfolio investment that constitutes
a material portion of our portfolio and that does not have a readily available market quotation at least once annually. With respect to
unquoted securities, our Investment Advisor, together with our independent valuation advisors, and subject at all times to the oversight
and approval of our Board, will value each investment considering, among other measures, discounted cash flow models, comparisons of financial
ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors. We have retained one or more independent providers of financial advisory services
to assist the Investment Advisor and the Board by performing certain limited third-party valuation services. We may appoint additional
or different third-party valuation firms in the future. 

When an external event such as a purchase transaction,
public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs with respect to a fair-valued portfolio company or comparable company, our Board will
use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and/or assist us in our valuation. Because we expect that there will not
be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair
value as determined in good faith by our Investment Advisor under the supervision of our Board using a documented valuation policy and
a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have
a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used
had readily available market quotations existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 

ASC Topic 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation
techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. ASC Topic 820 also provides guidance
regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on
earnings and provides for enhanced disclosures determined by the level of information used in the valuation. In accordance with ASC Topic
820, these inputs are summarized in the three levels listed below. 

Level 1 Valuations are based
on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. 

Level 2 Valuations are based
on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly and
model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable. 

Level 3 Valuations are based
on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
instruments whose value is determined using pricing models incorporating significant unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flow
models and other similar valuations techniques. The valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities generally requires significant management
judgment due to the inability to observe inputs to valuation. 

58 

In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair
value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy
is based on the lowest level of observable input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance
of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and it considers factors specific to the investment. 

With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily
available, our Investment Advisor will undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 

Investments for which no such market prices are available or reliable will be preliminarily valued at such value as the Investment Advisor may reasonably determine, which may include third-party valuations; 

At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment that constitutes a material portion of our portfolio and that does not have a readily available market quotation will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm; and 

Our Investment Advisor will then discuss valuations and determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of the respective independent valuation firms. 

Investment Transactions, Realized/Unrealized Gains or Losses,
and Income Recognition 

Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
date basis (for publicly-traded investments and securities traded through dealer markets) or upon closing of the transaction (for private
investments). The cost of an investment includes all costs incurred by the Company as part of the purchase of such investment. The difference
between the initially recognized cost and the subsequent fair value measurement of an investment is reflected as net change in
unrealized appreciation on non-controlled/non-affiliated company investments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Realized gain or loss from an investment is recorded
at the time of disposition and calculated using the weighted average cost method. Unrealized gain or loss reflects the changes in fair
value of investments as determined in compliance with the Investment Advisor s valuation policy. 

Interest income, adjusted for amortization of
market premium and accretion of market discount, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts.
Interest income on debt instruments is accrued and recognized for those issuers who are currently paying in full or expected to pay in
full. For those issuers who are in default or expected to default, interest is not accrued and is only recognized when received. Interest
income and expense include discounts accreted and premiums amortized on certain debt instruments as determined in good faith by the Adviser
and calculated using the effective interest method. Loan origination fees, original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums are
capitalized as part of the underlying cost of the investments and accreted or amortized over the life of the investment as interest income. 

Management and Incentive Fees 

The base management fee and the income-based incentive
fees are expensed each quarter and payable in arrears. Additionally, we accrue a capital gains-based incentive fee quarterly that is paid
annually in arrears. The accrual for the capital incentive fee includes the recognition of incentive fee on unrealized capital gains,
even though such incentive fee is neither earned nor payable to the Adviser until the gains are both realized and in excess of unrealized
depreciation on investments. The amount of capital gains incentive fee expense related to the hypothetical liquidation of the portfolio
(and assuming no other changes in realized or unrealized gains and losses) would only become payable to the Adviser in the event of a
complete liquidation of the Company s portfolio as of period end and the termination of the Advisory Agreement on such date. Also,
it should be noted that while we accrue the capital incentive fee quarterly, the expense will fluctuate with the Company s overall
investment results and the expense will be finalized at year end. 

59 

Expenses 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company incurred expenses of approximately 2,398 thousand and 7,215 thousand, respectively. For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred expenses of approximately 2,333 thousand and 6,470 thousand, respectively. The expenses
are primarily related to management fees, incentive fees, interest and debt financing expenses, organization expenses, professional fees,
directors fees, offering costs and administration and custodian fees. Expenses are recognized on an accrual basis. 

Federal Income Taxes 

We have elected to be treated, and to qualify
annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Generally, a RIC is not subject to federal income taxes on distributed income and gains
if it distributes at least 90 of its net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of its net long-term capital losses,
if any, to its stockholders. We intend to distribute sufficient dividends to maintain our RIC status each year and we do not anticipate
paying any material federal income taxes in the future. 

Investment Income 

For debt investments, we record interest income
on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. OID and purchased discounts and premiums are accreted/amortized
into interest income using the effective interest method, where applicable. Loan origination fees are deferred and accreted into interest
income using the effective interest method. We record prepayment premiums on loans and other investments as interest income when such
amounts are received. We stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. As of September
30, 2024 and 2023 we had no loans on non-accrual status. 

Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change
in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation 

We measure realized gains or losses by the difference
between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation
or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation
or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded
unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. 

Realized gains and losses from securities transactions
and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of securities are determined using the identified cost basis method for financial reporting. 

Contractual Obligations 

Commitments to extend credit include loan proceeds
we are obligated to advance, such as delayed draws. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no unfunded commitments. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Other than contractual commitments and other legal
contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not expect to have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.
These instruments include commitments to extend credit and fund equity capital and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity
and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding
commitments comprised of investments with commitments to fund revolving loans that had not been fully drawn or term loans with additional
commitments not yet funded. 

60 

Related Party Transactions 

As of September 30, 2024, affiliates owned approximately
41 of the Company representing approximately 22,824 thousand of the Company s net assets. As of December 31, 2023, affiliates
owned approximately 38 of the Company representing approximately 23,340 thousand of the Company s net assets. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, Moelis Asset, parent of the Investment Advisor, contributed 11 thousand to pay legal fees incurred by the Company. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Moelis Asset, parent of the Investment Advisor, did not make a contribution to the Company.
Moelis Asset will incur these expenses and they will not be charged back to the Company. 

The Company may, from time to time, purchase investments
from, or sell investments to affiliates of our Investment Advisor at fair value on the trade date. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no purchases of investments from or sales of investments to affiliates of our Investment Advisor. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred 20 thousand and 60 thousand in directors fees expense. 

The Company carries employment practices liability,
directors and officers and errors and omission insurance. For the best interests of the Company, these policies are joint liability policies
with Moelis Asset and its affiliates. 

Organizational and Offering Expenses 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 the Company did not incur organizational or offering expenses. Organizational costs are expensed as incurred and offering
cost are amortized over a twelve-month period. 

Investment Advisory Agreement 

We have initially entered into the Investment
Advisory Agreement with the Investment Advisor, an affiliate of Moelis Asset, which was approved by our Board and our sole stockholder
for an initial two-year term, under which the Investment Advisor, subject to the overall supervision of our Board manages the day-to-day
operations of and provides investment advisory services to us. Subsequent to that two-year term, the Board has approved the Investment
Advisory Agreement of Investment Advisor for renewal annually. 

On August 9, 2024, the Board approved the renewal
of the Investment Advisory Agreement. 

Our Investment Advisor has agreed to waive its
fees (base management and incentive fee), without recourse against or reimbursement by us, for any quarter where net investment income
plus net realized capital gains is not sufficient to maintain a targeted annual distribution payment on shares of common stock outstanding
on the relevant payment dates of 6.0 based on our net asset value per share. 

The base management fee is calculated at a maximum
annual rate of 1.0 of the average of the weighted average (based on the number of shares outstanding each day in the quarter) of our
gross assets (including uninvested cash and cash equivalents) at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters.
On August 13, 2021, the Board agreed to make investments rather than gross assets the basis for their fee to be more in line with the
waivers implemented for management fees. Net management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 331 thousand
and 680 thousand, respectively. Net management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and were 332 thousand and
 652 thousand, respectively. The Company elected to waive a portion of the management fee and charged management fees on investments rather
than gross assets. The Investment Advisor has agreed to a 6.0 priority dividend to shareholders before receiving a fee for the services
it provides to the Company. 

61 

Administration Agreement 

We have initially entered into the Administration
Agreement with the Administrator, an affiliate of Moelis Asset, which was approved by our Board and our sole stockholder for an initial
two-year term, under which the Administrator, subject to the overall supervision of our Board manages the day-to-day operations of, and
provides office space, office services and equipment and other administration services to us. Subsequent to that two-year term, the Board
has approved the Administration Agreement of Administrator for renewal annually. 

On August 9, 2024, the Board approved the renewal
of the Administration Agreement which automatically renews for successive one-year periods each September 17th; provided that such continuance
is specifically approved at least annually by the vote of the Board or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Company and the vote of a majority of the members of the Company s Board who are not parties to this Agreement or interested
persons (as such term defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act) of any such party, in accordance with the Investment
Company Act. 

Recent Developments 

Management has evaluated subsequent events through
the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements and has determined that there are no subsequent events outside the ordinary
scope of business that require adjustment to, or disclosure in, the consolidated financial statements other than those disclosed below. 

On October 1, 2024, the Company issued and sold
approximately 16,680 shares of its common stock to certain investors for an aggregate offering price of 159 thousand. The sale of its
common stock was made pursuant to subscription agreements between the Company and the investors, and the issuance of the common stock
was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof and Regulation
D thereunder. 

On October 10, 2024, the Company had its quarterly
distribution of approximately 1,120 thousand, of which approximately 492 thousand or approximately 51,637 shares were reinvested into
the fund. 

On October 18, 2024, the Company paid approximately
 1,244 thousand for the approximately 130,455 shares tendered and accepted at the close of the September 2024 tender offer. 

On October 18, 2024 the Company entered into a
three-year secured revolving Credit Agreement (the BoA Credit Agreement with Bank of America BoA as lender
and administrative agent (the BoA Credit Facility providing a maximum of 80,000 thousand BoA Maximum Facility
Amount to Steele Creek Capital Funding II, LLC Funding II ). The Company created a wholly owned subsidiary, Funding
II, which will be used to hold the Company s investments, and a first priority continuing security interest in, to and under each
investment, all underlying investments and underlying assets has been granted to BoA to use as collateral for the BoA Credit Facility. 

On October 18, 2024, the Company terminated the
existing Credit Agreement with BNP and the wholly owned subsidiary, Funding I, is in the process of being closed. The collateral assets
began moving from Funding I to Funding II. Funding I will remain open until all assets are moved and accounts are closed. 

On November 1, 2024, the Company issued and sold
 40,165 shares of its common stock to certain investors for an aggregate offering price of 382
thousand. The sale of its common stock was made pursuant to subscription agreements between the Company and the investors, and the issuance
of the common stock was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2)
thereof and Regulation D thereunder. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 

We are subject to financial market risks, including
changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of
interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected
by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant
change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 

62 

As of September 30, 2024, 100.0 of our loan
portfolio bore interest at floating rates with 49.7 (at fair value) having an interest rate floor between 0.50 and 1.00 . The
floating rate loans are usually based on a SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) rate and typically have
durations ranging from one to nine months, after which they reset to current market interest rates. Floating rate investments
subject to a floor generally reset to the current market index after one to nine months if the index exceeds the floor. For
positions with an interest rate floor, we do not benefit from increases in interest rates until such rates exceed the floor and
thereafter benefit from market rates above any such floor. Given the current interest rate environment in the United States SOFR
base rates are above the floors in effect as of quarter end. Base rates on 100 of the portfolio exceeds the stated
floors. 

Assuming that the consolidated statement of assets
and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 was to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity,
the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates: 

As of September 30, 2024 
 
 Basis Point Changes 
 Interest Income 
 Interest Expense 
 Net Income 
 
 Up 300 basis points 
 3,904 
 (2,604 
 1,300 
 
 Up 200 basis points 
 2,602 
 (1,736

 (2,601 
 1,736 
 (865 
 
 Down 300 basis points 
 (3,902 
 2,604 
 (1,298 

Although management believes that this measure
is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rates, it does not reflect any potential impact to the fair value of our investments as a
result of changes to interest rates, nor does it adjust for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition
of the assets in our consolidated statement of assets and liabilities and other business developments that could affect the net increase/(decrease)
in net assets resulting from operations or net investment income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not
differ materially from those shown above. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of September 30, 2024, we, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on
that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such
possible controls and procedures. 

Management Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act. 

In connection with the preparation of this quarterly
report, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making that assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on its
assessment, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a 15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period ended September
30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
