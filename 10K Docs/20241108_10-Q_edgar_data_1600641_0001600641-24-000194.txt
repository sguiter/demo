These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about: 
 
 our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our net revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and our ability to achieve and maintain future profitability, in particular with respect to the impacts of inflation, macroeconomic uncertainty, and geopolitical instability;

These forward-looking statements reflect our management s beliefs and views with respect to future events and are based on estimates and assumptions as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. As a result of these factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified timeframe, or at all. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. 
 In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we believe that such information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, such information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on them. 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements relate only to events as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by law. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference and have filed as exhibits with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q by these cautionary statements.

 The 2011 Plan was administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise prices, vesting, and other restrictions were determined at the discretion of Compensation Committee of the Board. 
 Following the completion of the Company s IPO in June 2021, no additional awards and no shares of the Company s common stock remain available for future issuance under the 2011 Plan. However, the 2011 Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted thereunder. 
 2021 Stock Incentive Plan 
 In May 2021, the Company's Board adopted, and its stockholders approved, the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan ), which became effective upon the SEC declaring the Company s IPO registration statement effective. The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options ISOs ), non-statutory stock options, restricted share awards, stock unit awards RSUs ), stock appreciation rights, cash-based awards, and performance-based stock awards, or collectively, stock awards. ISOs may be granted only to the Company s employees, including officers, and the employees of its parent or subsidiaries. All other stock awards may be granted to the Company s employees, officers, non-employee directors, consultants, and the employees and consultants of its parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates. Depending on the nature of the award granted, the vesting terms may differ. Generally for new hire awards, the requisite service period for RSUs to vest is over from the grant date, with vesting on the first anniversary and the balance vesting ratably on a quarterly basis over the remaining vesting period. Generally, all additional RSUs vest ratably on a quarterly basis over three or beginning on the three month anniversary from the grant date. For RSU grants to members of our Board of Directors, initial awards vest ratably on an annual basis over , and over for our Board of Directors annual awards. 
 The aggregate number of shares of the Company s common stock that may be issued pursuant to stock awards under the 2021 Plan will not exceed the sum of (x) shares (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, and the like), plus (y) the sum of (1) the number of reserved shares not issued or subject to outstanding awards under the 2011 Plan on the effective date of the 2021 Plan and (2) the number of shares subject to outstanding stock awards granted under the 2011 Plan and that, following the effective date of the 2021 Plan, (A) are subsequently forfeited or terminated for any reason before being exercised or settled, (B) are not issued because such stock award is settled in cash, (C) are subject to vesting restrictions and are subsequently forfeited, (D) are withheld or reacquired to satisfy the applicable exercise, strike, or purchase price, or (E) are withheld or reacquired to satisfy a tax withholding obligation, plus (z) an annual increase on the first day of each fiscal year, for a period of not more than years, beginning on January 1, 2022 and ending on, and including, January 1, 2031, in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) of the outstanding shares on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or (ii) such lesser amount that the Compensation Committee of the Board determines for purposes of the annual increase for that fiscal year. On January 1, 2024, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2021 Plan was automatically increased according to its terms by shares.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations, and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. 
 
 Company Overview 
 We are one of the world s leading online marketplaces for connecting design lovers with many of the best sellers and makers of vintage, antique, and contemporary furniture, home d cor, jewelry, watches, art, and fashion. We believe we are a leading online marketplace for these luxury design products based on the aggregate number of such listings on our online marketplace and our Gross Merchandise Value GMV ). Our thoroughly vetted seller base, in-depth marketing content, and custom-built technology platform create trust in our brand and facilitate high-consideration purchases. By disrupting the way these items are bought and sold, we are both expanding access to, and growing the market for, luxury design products. 
 1stDibs began in 2000 with the vision of bringing the magic of the Paris flea market online by creating a listings site for top vintage and antique furniture sellers. Soon thereafter, we moved our headquarters to New York City and focused primarily on adding U.S.-based sellers to our site. The quality of our initial seller base enabled us to build a reputation in the design industry as a trusted source for unique luxury design products. In over two decades of operating history, we have strengthened our brand and deepened our seller relationships. We launched our e-commerce platform in 2013 and transitioned to a full e-commerce marketplace model in 2016. Since inception we have expanded our offerings to other verticals such as home decor, jewelry, watches, art, and fashion. We provide our sellers, the vast majority of which are small businesses, access to a global community of buyers and a platform to facilitate e-commerce at scale. Our sellers use our platform to manage their inventory, build their digital marketing presence, and communicate and negotiate prices directly with buyers. We provide our buyers a trusted purchase experience with our user-friendly interface, dedicated specialist support, and 1stDibs Promise, our comprehensive buyer protection program. We operate an asset-light business model which allows us to scale in a capital efficient manner. While we enable shipping and fulfillment logistics, we do not take physical possession of the items sold on our online marketplace. 
 
 Key Operating and Financial Metrics 
 We use the following key metrics and non-GAAP measures to evaluate our performance, identify trends affecting our business, and make strategic decisions: 
 GMV; 
 Number of Orders; 
 Active Buyers; and 
 Adjusted EBITDA (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA). 
 For GMV, Number of Orders, and Active Buyers, these metrics are based on internal company data, assumptions, and estimates and are used in managing our business. We believe that these figures are reasonable estimates, and we actively take measures to improve their accuracy, such as eliminating known fictitious or duplicate accounts. There are, however, inherent challenges in gathering accurate data across large online and mobile populations. For example, individuals may have multiple email accounts in violation of our terms of service, which would result in an Active Buyer being counted more than once, thus impacting the accuracy of our number of Active Buyers. In addition, certain metrics, such as the number of Active Buyers, and Number of Orders, and GMV are measured based on such numbers as reported in a given month, minus cancellations within that month. As we do not retroactively adjust such numbers for cancellations occurring after the month, the metrics presented do not reflect subsequent order cancellations. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating these metrics to 
 26 

improve their accuracy. These key operating and financial metrics may vary from period to period and should not be viewed as indicative of other metrics. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 GMV 84,613 88,983 267,813 275,905 Number of Orders 33,347 31,202 102,614 98,988 Active Buyers 62,527 63,227 62,527 63,227 Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited) (2,983) (1,802) (6,366) (11,635) Gross Merchandise Value 
 We define GMV as the total dollar value from items sold by our sellers through 1stDibs in a given month, minus cancellations within that month, and excluding shipping and sales taxes. GMV includes all sales reported to us by our sellers, whether transacted through the 1stDibs online marketplace or reported as an offline sale. We view GMV as a measure of the total economic activity generated by our online marketplace and as an indicator of the scale, growth, and health of our online marketplace. Our historical performance for GMV may not be indicative of future performance in GMV. 
 Number of Orders 
 We define Number of Orders as the total number of orders placed or reported through the 1stDibs online marketplace in a given month, minus cancellations within that month. Our historical performance for Number of Orders may not be indicative of future performance in Number of Orders. 
 Active Buyers 
 We define Active Buyers as buyers who have made at least one purchase through our online marketplace during the 12 months ended on the last day of the period presented, net of cancellations. A buyer is identified by a unique email address; thus an Active Buyer could have more than one account if they were to use a separate unique email address to set up each account. We believe this metric reflects scale, engagement and brand awareness, and our ability to convert user activity on our online marketplace into transactions. Our historical performance for Active Buyers may not be indicative of future performance in new Active Buyers. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, other income, net, provision for income taxes, gain on sale of business, and strategic alternative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure used by our management and board of directors to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage of our business. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the income and expenses that we exclude from Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by our management in their financial and operational decision-making. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for more information and for a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Net Revenue 
 Our net revenue consists principally of seller marketplace services. Seller marketplace services primarily consist of marketplace transactions, subscriptions, and listing fees. Marketplace transaction fees are collected when sellers pay us commissions ranging from 5 to 50 of GMV and processing fees, which are approximately 3 of the buyer s total payment, net of expected refunds. If a seller accepts a return or refund of an on-platform purchase, the related commission and processing fees are refunded. Subscriptions provide access to our online marketplace, allowing sellers, who are our customers, to execute successful purchase transactions with buyers. We offer our sellers various subscription pricing tiers which allows them to choose the plan that best fits their business, with choices of a higher monthly subscription fee and lower commission rates or lower monthly subscription fee and higher commission rates. Additionally, some sellers have no monthly subscription fees and higher commission rates, however, we no longer offer this option to new sellers. Listing fee revenue is collected when sellers pay us for promoting certain products on their behalf and at their discretion through our online marketplace. Advertisements consist of impression-based ads displayed on our online marketplace on the seller s behalf. 
 27 

Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue includes payment processor fees and hosting expenses. Cost of revenue also includes expenses associated with payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, other headcount-related expenses associated with operations personnel supporting revenue-related operations and logistics, consulting costs, and amortization expense related to our capitalized internal-use software. 
 In certain transactions where our shipping services are elected by sellers, we facilitate shipping of items purchased from the seller to the buyer. The difference between the amount collected for shipping and the amount charged by the shipping carrier is included in cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. We facilitate fulfillment and shipping, but do not take ownership of or manage inventory. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Gross profit is net revenue less cost of revenue, and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of net revenue. Gross profit has been, and will continue to be, affected by various factors, including leveraging economies of scale, the costs associated with hosting our platform, the level of amortization of our internal-use software, the fluctuations in shipping costs including our ability to pass these costs on to buyers, and the extent to which we expand our operations. We expect that our gross margin will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, advertising expense, consulting costs, and promotional discounts offered to new and existing buyers. Advertising expenses consist primarily of costs incurred promoting and marketing our services, such as costs associated with acquiring new users through performance-based marketing, social media programs, email, and events. Promotional discounts and incentives represent incentives solely to end buyers and, therefore, are not considered payments made to our customers. Buyers are not our customers because access to the 1stDibs online marketplace is free for buyers, and we have no performance obligations with respect to buyers. 
 Technology Development 
 Technology development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related expenses associated with engineering and product development personnel and consulting costs related to technology development. We expense all technology development expenses as incurred, except for those expenses that meet the criteria for capitalization as internal-use software. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facility and human resources related personnel, lease expense, net of sublease income, business liability insurance, accounting, professional fees, and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment. We expense all general and administrative expenses as incurred. 
 Provision for Transaction Losses 
 Provision for transaction losses primarily consists of transaction loss expense associated with our buyer protection program, including damages to products caused by shipping and transit, items that were not received or not as represented by the seller, and reimbursements to buyers at our discretion if they are dissatisfied with their experience. The provision for transaction losses also includes bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance.

The decrease of 0.6 million, or 3 , was primarily driven by a 0.7 million decrease in salaries and benefits resulting from decreases in average headcount from the prior period, primarily related to our reduction in workforce in June 2023, partially offset by annual compensation increases in March. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Gross profit was 47.0 million and gross margin was 71.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to gross profit of 44.6 million and gross margin of 70.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit and gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by our initiatives to improve our take rates and net revenue, as well as our cost savings initiatives in the second half of 2023 which contributed to a decrease in our cost of revenue, as outlined above. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change Sales and marketing 27,580 28,007 (427) (2) 
 31 

Sales and marketing expense was 27.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 28.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.4 million, or 2 , was primarily driven by a 1.9 million decrease in salaries and benefits resulting from decreases in headcount, primarily related to our reduction in workforce in June 2023, partially offset by annual compensation increases in March, and a 1.8 million increase in performance-based marketing spend which contributed to an increase in GMV during the first half of 2024. 
 Technology Development 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change Technology development 15,686 17,199 (1,513) (9) 
 Technology development expense was 15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 17.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.5 million, or 9 , was primarily driven by a 1.9 million decrease in salaries and benefits resulting from decreases in headcount, primarily related to our reduction in workforce in June 2023, which were partially offset by annual compensation increases in March and minor increases in the normal course. 
 General and Administrative 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change General and administrative 20,756 22,323 (1,567) (7) 
 General and administrative expense was 20.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 22.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.6 million, or 7 , was primarily driven by a 1.8 million decrease in lease expense, net, primarily due to sublease income related to our August 2023 sublease for our former New York City corporate headquarters, a 1.1 million decrease related to lower rates negotiated with vendors, including lower insurance expense, and a 0.5 million decrease in professional fees due to expenses incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to strategic alternative expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a 1.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and a 0.6 million increase in salaries and benefits, primarily due to our annual compensation increases and equity grants which occur annually in March. 
 Provision for Transaction Losses 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change Provision for transaction losses 2,183 2,940 (757) (26) 
 Provision for transaction losses was 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.8 million, or 26 , was primarily driven by a decrease in damage claims as a result of new policies implemented by us and in partnership with our carriers. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change Total other income, net 5,823 6,093 (270) (4) 
 Other income, net was 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and was due primarily to interest income on our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. 
 32 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We have included Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, because it is a key measure used by our management team to help us to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. We also use this measure to analyze our financial results, establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business, and make strategic decisions. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the income and expenses that we exclude from Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by our management in their financial and operational decision-making. We also believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core business and results of operations over multiple periods with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors, and to analyze our operating performance. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way that these measures are calculated. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered as the sole measure of our performance and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplemental in nature, and are not intended, and should not be construed, as a substitute for the related financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. These limitations of Adjusted EBITDA include the following: 
 The exclusion of certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization of property and equipment. While these are non-cash charges, we may need to replace the assets being depreciated in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for these replacements or new capital expenditure requirements; 
 The exclusion of stock-based compensation expense, which has been a significant recurring expense and will continue to constitute a significant recurring expense for the foreseeable future, as equity awards are expected to continue to be an important component of our compensation strategy; 
 The exclusion of other income, net, which includes interest income related to our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency exchange; and 
 The exclusion of strategic alternative expenses in connection with capital return strategies, buy- and sell-side mergers, acquisitions and partnerships which include integration costs, sale of a business or subsidiary, business optimization costs related to revisions of operational objectives and priorities which include restructuring charges, in all cases outside the ordinary course. 
 Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other GAAP results. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as our net loss, excluding: (1) depreciation and amortization; (2) stock-based compensation expense; (3) other income, net; (4) provision for income taxes; and (5) strategic alternative expenses. The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net loss (5,683) (3,305) (13,423) (19,758) Depreciation and amortization 507 449 1,439 1,815 Stock-based compensation expense 3,902 2,982 11,008 9,340 Other income, net (1,713) (1,928) (5,823) (6,093) Provision for income taxes 4 8 Strategic alternative expenses 425 3,061 Adjusted EBITDA (2,983) (1,802) (6,366) (11,635) 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 109.4 million and an accumulated deficit of 327.1 million. Net cash used in operating activities was 5.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect operating losses and negative cash flows from operations to continue in the foreseeable future as we continue 
 33 

to strategically invest in growth activities. Our principal use of cash is to fund our operations including platform development to support our strategic initiatives and anticipated share repurchases under the 2024 Stock Repurchase Program. 
 Based on our current plans, we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures in the near term to support our ongoing activities. While management believes that our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months, we may need to borrow funds or raise additional equity to achieve our longer-term business objectives. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the emergence of competing online marketplaces and other adverse market developments; 
 the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and technology development expenditures; and 
 any investments, acquisitions or other similar strategic endeavors we may choose to pursue in the future. 
 A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables could significantly impact our operating plans, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such plans. In addition, any future borrowings may result in additional restrictions on our business and any issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to investors. If we are unable to raise additional capital when we need it, it could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 In August 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the 2023 Stock Repurchase Program to repurchase up to an aggregate of 20.0 million of our common stock. In June 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to our 2023 Stock Repurchase Program to an aggregate authorized repurchase amount of 25.5 million. On June 10, 2024, we announced the completion of our 2023 Stock Repurchase Program. 
 In August 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the 2024 Stock Repurchase Program to repurchase up to an aggregate of 10.0 million of our common stock. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, 191,935 shares of our common stock were purchased under the 2024 Stock Repurchase Program for a total cost of 0.9 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 4.3 million shares of our common stock were purchased for a total cost of 22.8 million and includes purchases under both the 2023 and the 2024 Stock Repurchase Programs. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities 
 (5,708) (11,475) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 
 15,325 (109,600) Net cash used in financing activities 
 (25,155) (1,234) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 222 44 Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (15,316) (122,265) 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was driven primarily by a 2.2 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments and invoices, a 2.2 million decrease in operating lease liabilities due to the continued lease payments on our previous and current NYC headquarters, partially offset by our sublease income, and a 1.8 million decrease in other current liabilities and other liabilities related to payments to settle multiple Sales and other non-income tax contingencies. Theses decreases were partially offset by a 2.7 million increase in payables due to sellers due to timing of the bi-weekly payments we make to our sellers. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and was driven primarily by net revenue decreasing at a faster pace than operating expenses. Our changes in operating assets and liabilities were impacted by a negative change in operating lease liabilities of 2.1 million due to the continued lease payments on our NYC headquarters and a 1.2 million change in other assets, primarily related to the 1.1 million broker fee paid in connection with our subleasing of our NYC headquarters. 
 34 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 15.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was driven primarily by 85.6 million maturities and sales of short-term investments, partially offset by 68.9 million purchases of short-term investments. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 109.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and was driven primarily by 166.5 million purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by 58.2 million maturities of short-term investments. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 25.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was driven primarily by 22.8 million in purchases of our common stock as part of our 2023 and 2024 Stock Repurchase Programs and 3.2 million of payments for taxes related to net share settlements of stock-based compensation awards, partially offset by 0.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1.2 million and was driven primarily by 1.3 million of purchases of our common stock as part of our 2023 Stock Repurchase Program. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in commitments under contractual obligations compared to the contractual obligations disclosed in our Form 10-K. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that (i) we are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. We may choose to early adopt any new or revised accounting standards whenever such early adoption is permitted for private companies. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. 
 There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates included in our Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks are described below. At times, our cash balances with individual banking institutions are in excess of federally insured limits. We have not experienced any credit losses related to our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balances. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 Interest rate risk relates to the loss we could incur in our cash portfolios due to a change in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 109.4 million. Our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand and money market accounts, as well as available-for-sale debt securities with an original maturity of 90 days or less. Our short-term investments consist primarily of U.S. Government agency and Treasury 
 35 

securities, as well as commercial paper and corporate notes which have an original maturity greater than 90 days and are highly liquid in nature. Due to the nature of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, we would expect a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates to result in an approximate increase or decrease of 0.7 million in our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. While these are our best estimates of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel. 
 Our principal use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments is to fund our operations including platform development to support our strategic initiatives and anticipated share repurchases under the 2024 Stock Repurchase Program. The remainder of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Our net revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, and British pounds, depending on the currency selection of the seller. Our cost of revenue and operating expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. As our online marketplace continues to grow globally, our results of operations and cash flows may be subject to fluctuations due to the change in foreign exchange rates. To date, fluctuations due to changes in the Euro and British pound have not been significant, but we may experience material foreign exchange gains and losses in our statement of operations in the future. As of September 30, 2024, we would expect an adverse 10 change in current exchange rates to result in no more than a 2.4 million decrease in net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable balances. This risk is mitigated by requiring upfront payment for many of our services and due to our diverse customer base, dispersed over various geographic regions and industrial sectors. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our net revenue. We maintain provisions for potential credit losses and such losses to date have been within our expectations. We evaluate the solvency of our customers on an ongoing basis to determine if additional allowances for doubtful accounts need to be recorded. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe certain metrics, including our GMV and net revenue, have been negatively impacted, both directly and indirectly, by macroeconomic factors, including inflation and as a result significant capital market and housing market volatility. Additionally, if our costs were to become subject to inflationary pressures, we might not be able to fully offset such higher costs through net revenue and GMV increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot assure you our business will not be affected in the future by inflation. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. Similarly, an evaluation of controls cannot provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 
 36 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by the collusion of two or more people or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 37 

Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of current matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Even if any particular litigation or claim is not resolved in a manner that is adverse to our interests, such litigation can have a negative impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources from our business, and other factors. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, operating results or cash flows. For a detailed discussion of certain risks that affect our business, refer to the section entitled Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The risks described in our 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. We describe in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q certain known trends and uncertainties that affect our business. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 The following table presents details of our monthly share repurchases for the three months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share (a) Total number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (b) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet be Purchased under the Plans or Programs (in thousands) July 1, 2024 - July 31, 2024 August 1, 2024 -August 31, 2024 84,642 4.77 84,642 9,596 September 1, 2024- September 31, 2024 107,293 4.77 107,293 9,084 Total 191,935 191,935 
 (a) Average price per share includes broker commissions. 
 (b) On August 20, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a 2024 Stock Repurchase Program to repurchase up to an aggregate of 10.0 million of our common stock. 
 The Company s officers and directors are required to comply with the Company s securities trading policy at all times, including during a repurchase program. The securities trading policy, among other things, prohibits trading in the Company s securities when in possession of material non-public information and restricts the ability of certain officers or director from transacting in the Company s securities during specific blackout periods, subject to certain limited exceptions, including transactions pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan that complies with the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 (c) Adoption or Termination of Insider Trading Arrangements 
 No directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (in each case, as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K) for the purchase or sale of the Company s securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.
