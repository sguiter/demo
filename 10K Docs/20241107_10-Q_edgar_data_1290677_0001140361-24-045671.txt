Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (this Quarterly Report ), contains forward-looking statements within
 the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements may generally be identified by the use of words such as anticipate, believe, expect, intend, plan, and will or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or
 comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events, and depend on circumstances, that
 may or may not occur in the future. As a result, actual events may differ materially from those expressed in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by Turning Point Brands, Inc. TPB ), in this
 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speaks only as of the date hereof. New risks and uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is impossible for TPB to predict these events or how they may affect it. TPB has no obligation, and does not intend, to
 update any forward-looking statements after the date hereof, except as required by federal securities laws. Factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to:

declining sales of tobacco products, and expected continuing decline of sales in the tobacco industry overall;

our dependence on a small number of third-party suppliers and producers;

the possibility that we will be unable to identify or contract with new suppliers or producers in the event of a supply or product disruption, as well as other
 supply chain concerns, including delays in product shipments and increases in freight cost;

the possibility that our licenses to use certain brands or trademarks will be terminated, challenged or restricted;

failure to maintain consumer brand recognition and loyalty of our customers;

our reliance on relationships with several large retailers and national chains for distribution of our products;

intense competition and our ability to compete effectively;

competition from illicit sources and the damage caused by illicit products to our brand equity;

contamination of our tobacco supply or products; 

uncertainty and continued evolution of the markets for our products;

complications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and operations;

substantial and increasing regulation and changes in U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA enforcement priorities;

regulation or marketing denials of our products by the FDA, which has broad regulatory powers;

many of our products contain nicotine, which is considered to be a highly addictive substance;

requirement to maintain compliance with master settlement agreement escrow account;

possible significant increases in federal, state and local municipal tobacco- and nicotine-related taxes;

our products are marketed pursuant to a policy of FDA enforcement priorities which could change, and our products could become subject to increased regulatory
 burdens by the FDA;

uncertainty related to the PMTA application process;

our products are subject to developing and unpredictable regulation, such as court actions that impact obligations;

increases in state and local regulation of our products have been proposed and/or enacted;

increases in the taxation of our products could adversely affect our business;

sensitivity of end-customers to increased sales taxes and economic conditions, including as a result of inflation and other declines in purchasing power;

possible increasing international control and regulation;

failure to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations;

imposition of or increases to significant tariffs on imports into the U.S.; 

the scientific community s lack of information regarding the long-term health effects of certain substances contained in some of our products;

significant product liability litigation;

our amount of indebtedness;

the terms of our indebtedness, which may restrict our current and future operations;

our ability to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting; 

identification of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which, if not remediated appropriately or timely, could result in loss
 of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price;

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law and certain regulations, could discourage or prohibit acquisition bids or merger proposals,
 which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock;

our certificate of incorporation limits the ownership of our common stock by individuals and entities that are Restricted Investors. These restrictions may
 affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in Restricted Investors (as defined in our Certificate of Incorporation) being required to sell or redeem their shares at a loss or relinquish their voting, dividend and distribution
 rights;

future sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or
 convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us;

The following Management s Discussion and Analysis MD A relates to the unaudited financial statements of Turning Point Brands, Inc., included elsewhere in this
 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The MD A is intended to enable the reader to understand the Company s financial condition and results of operations, including any material changes in the Company s financial condition and results of operations
 since December 31, 2023, and as compared with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The MD A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
 included in this Quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023
 Annual Report ).

In this MD A, unless the context requires otherwise, references to our Company we, our, or us refer to Turning Point Brands, Inc., and its consolidated
 subsidiaries. References to TPB refer to Turning Point Brands, Inc., without any of its subsidiaries. Many of the amounts and percentages in this discussion have been rounded for convenience of presentation.

Overview

Turning Point Brands, Inc. is a leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of branded consumer products. We sell a wide range of products to adult consumers consisting of staple products with
 our iconic brands Zig-Zag and Stoker s and our next generation products to fulfill evolving consumer preferences. Among other markets, we compete in the alternative smoking accessories
 and Other Tobacco Products OTP industries. The alternative smoking accessories market is a dynamic market experiencing robust secular growth driven by cannabinoid legalization in the U.S. and Canada, and positively evolving consumer
 perception and acceptance in North America. The OTP industry, which consists of non-cigarette tobacco products, exhibited low-single-digit consumer unit annualized growth over the four-year period ended 2023 as reported by Management Science
 Associates, Inc. a third-party analytics and information company. Our segments are led by our core proprietary and iconic brands: Zig-Zag in the Zig-Zag products segment and Stoker s along with
 FRE , Beech -Nut and Trophy in the Stoker s products segment.
 Our businesses generate solid cash flow which we use to invest in our business, finance acquisitions, increase brand support, expand our distribution infrastructure, and strengthen our capital position. We currently ship to approximately 820
 distributors with an additional 650 secondary, indirect wholesalers in the U.S. that carry and sell our products. Under the leadership of a senior management team with extensive experience in the consumer products, alternative smoking accessories
 and tobacco industries, we have grown and diversified our business through new product launches, category expansions, and acquisitions while concurrently improving operational efficiency.

We believe there are meaningful opportunities to grow through investing in organic growth, acquisitions and joint ventures across all product categories. Our products are currently available in
 approximately 197,000 U.S. retail locations which, with the addition of retail stores in Canada, brings our total North American retail presence to an estimated 217,000 points of distribution. Our sales team targets widespread distribution to all
 traditional retail channels, including convenience stores, and we have a growing e-commerce business.

Products

We operate in three segments: Zig-Zag products, Stoker s products and Creative Distribution Solutions CDS ). In our Zig-Zag products segment, we principally market and distribute (i) rolling
 papers, tubes, and related products; (ii) finished cigars and make-your-own MYO cigar wraps; and (iii) lighters and other accessories. In addition, we have a majority stake in Turning Point Brands Canada which is a specialty marketing and
 distribution firm focused on building brands in the Canadian cannabis accessories, tobacco and alternative products categories. In our Stoker s products segment, we (i) manufacture and market moist snuff tobacco MST and (ii) contract for and
 market FRE, our modern oral product; and (iii) contract for and market loose leaf chewing tobacco products. In our Creative Distribution Solutions segment, we (i) market and distribute liquid nicotine products and certain other products without
 tobacco and/or nicotine; (ii) distribute a wide assortment of products to non-traditional retail via Beast Distribution (formerly known as VaporBeast), and (iii) market and distribute a wide assortment of products to individual consumers via the
 Company s B2C online platform.

Operations

Our core Zig-Zag products and Stoker s products segments primarily generate revenues from the sale of our products to wholesale distributors who, in turn, resell the products to retail
 operations. Our acquisition of Vapor Beast in 2016 expanded our revenue streams as we began selling directly to non-traditional retail outlets. Our acquisition of IVG in 2018 enhanced our B2C revenue stream with the addition of an online
 platform. Our net sales, which include federal excise taxes, consist of gross sales net of cash discounts, returns, and selling and marketing allowances.

We rely on long-standing relationships with high-quality, established manufacturers to provide the majority of our produced products. Approximately 75 of our production, as measured by net sales, is
 outsourced to suppliers. The remaining production consists primarily of our moist snuff tobacco operations located in Dresden, Tennessee and Louisville, Kentucky. Our principal operating expenses include the cost of raw materials used to
 manufacture the limited number of our products which we produce in-house; the cost of finished products, which are generally purchased goods; federal excise taxes; legal expenses; and compensation expenses, including benefits and costs of salaried
 personnel.

Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations

We consider the following to be the key factors affecting our results of operations:

Our ability to further penetrate markets with our existing products;

Our ability to introduce new products and product lines that complement our core business;

Decreasing interest in some tobacco products among consumers;

Price sensitivity in our end-markets;

Marketing and promotional initiatives, which cause variability in our results;

Costs and increasing regulation of promotional and advertising activities;

General economic conditions, including consumer access to disposable income and other conditions affecting purchasing power such as inflation and the interest rate environment;

Labor and production costs;

Cost of complying with regulation, including the deeming regulation , as well as the unpredictable nature of the regulatory regimes;

Increasing and unpredictable regulation and/or marketing order decisions impacting Creative Distribution Solutions products;

Counterfeit and other illegal products in our end-markets;

Currency fluctuations;

Our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities; and

Our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions.

Net Sales: For the three months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated net sales increased 3.9 million, or 3.8 compared to the prior year period, driven by an
 increase in the Zig-Zag and Stoker s products segments, partially offset by a decline in the Creative Distribution Solutions segment.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales in the Zig-Zag products segment increased 2.6 million, or 5.5 compared to the prior year period. The increase in net sales was driven
 primarily by 1.4 million of growth in our cigar products, 1.2 million of growth in our U.S. papers and wraps, and 0.5 million of growth in our Canadian products business, partially offset by a decline of 0.8 million in our Clipper lighter
 business.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales in the Stoker s products segment increased 4.5 million, or 12.1 compared to the prior year period. For the three months ended September
 30, 2024, sales volume of Stoker s products increased 2.9 as compared with the prior year period contributing 1.1 million to the increase, and price/product mix increased 9.2 which contributed 3.4 million to the increase. The increase in net
 sales was driven by 3.9 million of growth in our modern oral product FRE and 0.8 million of growth of Stoker s 
 MST, partially offset by a 0.3 million decline in net sales of loose-leaf chewing tobacco.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales in the Creative Distribution Solutions segment decreased 3.1 million, or 17.4 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net
 sales was primarily the result of lower sales volumes in the liquid nicotine distribution business, contributing 3.1 million to the decrease, and our strategic decision to eliminate certain unprofitable brands and to focus on a narrower set of
 products.

Gross Profit: For the three months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated gross profit increased 2.1 million, or 4.0 compared to the prior year period. Gross
 profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to 50.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 50.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase in gross profit was driven by increased margins in
 the Stoker s products segment, partially offset by decreased margins in the Creative Distribution Solutions segment.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit in the Zig-Zag products segment increased 0.6 million, or 2.2 compared to the prior year period. Gross profit as a percentage of net
 sales decreased to 55.4 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 57.2 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by growth in U.S. papers and Canadian products, which generate higher
 margins, offset by higher net sales of cigar products which generate lower margins than other products in the segment.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit in the Stoker s products segment increased 2.5 million, or 12.1 compared to the prior year period. Gross profit as a percentage of
 net sales increased slightly to 55.8 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 55.7 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by Stoker s MST net sales growth at higher margins, and higher
 net sales of FRE, though at lower margins than other products in the segment.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit in the Creative Distribution Solutions segment decreased 1.0 million, or 23.3 compared to the prior year period. Gross profit as a
 percentage of net sales decreased to 22.1 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 23.8 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of sales channel mix as business-to-business net
 sales, which generates lower margins than business-to-consumer sales, increased to 83 of net segment sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 77 of net segment sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Operating Income (Loss): For the three months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated operating income increased 0.3 million, or 1.4 compared to the prior
 year period. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 19.4 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.9 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by decreased gross
 profit in the Creative Distribution Solutions segment, partially offset by increased gross profit in the Zig-Zag and Stoker s products segments.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating income in the Zig-Zag products segment increased 0.7 million, or 4.2 compared to the prior year period. Operating income as a percentage
 of net sales increased to 16.5 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 16.4 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increased gross profit in our Canadian products business, U.S.
 papers and cigar products, combined with lower operational costs.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating income in the Stoker s products segment increased 1.5 million, or 9.3 compared to the prior year period. Operating income
 as a percentage of net sales increased to 16.2 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 15.4 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by Stoker s MST net sales growth at higher
 margins, and higher net sales of FRE which represented a higher percentage of the segment s sales compared to the prior year period and has lower margins than other products in the segment.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating loss in the Creative Distribution Solutions segment decreased 0.2 million, or 39.6 compared to the prior year period. Operating loss as
 a percentage of net sales decreased to (0.3) of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from (0.5) of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by cost savings that were not matched by the decline
 in net revenue. The decline in revenue was expected in light of our decision to focus on more profitable products.

Included in consolidated operating income are costs of the Company which are not assigned to one of the three reportable segments and includes: (i) corporate overhead
 expense, including executive management, finance, legal and information technology salaries, and professional services, such as audit, external legal costs and information technology services, as well as (ii) costs related to the FDA premarket
 tobacco product application. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, unallocated costs were 13.7 million compared to 11.7 million in the prior year period, an increase of 2.1 million or 17.6 .

Interest Expense, net: For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense, net decreased 0.2 million compared to the prior year period as a
 result of the repurchase of 15.0 million of Convertible Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2023, the maturity of the Convertible Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2024, and increased interest income on cash deposits due to rising interest
 rates.

Investment (Gain) Loss: For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had an investment gain of 0.2 million compared to a 2.1 million loss for the three
 months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily the result of no impairments recognized on our investments in the third quarter of 2024, compared to an impairment charge recognized on our investment in Wild Hempettes for 2.2 million in
 the third quarter of 2023.

Gain on Extinguishment of Debt: There was no gain or loss on extinguishment of debt for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 0.6 million
 gain on extinguishment of debt for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of repurchasing 15.0 million of Convertible Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2023.

Income Tax Expense: Our income tax expense of 4.6 million was 27.1 of income before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our
 effective income tax rate was 25.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest: Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest was 0.0 million for the three months
 ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Net Sales: For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated net sales increased 2.9 million, or 0.9 compared to the prior year period, driven by an
 increase in the Zig-Zag and Stoker s products segments, partially offset by a decline in the Creative Distribution Solutions segment.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales in the Zig-Zag products segment increased 11.1 million, or 8.2 compared to the prior year period. The increase in net sales was driven
 primarily by 6.2 million of growth in U.S. papers and wraps, 5.2 million of growth in cigars, 1.9 million of growth in our Canadian products business and 2.1 million of growth in the alternative smoking accessories market, partially offset by
 declines of 4.0 million in our Clipper lighter business.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales in the Stoker s products segment increased 13.9 million, or 13.0 compared to the prior year period. For the nine months ended September
 30, 2024, sales volume of Stoker s products increased 2.9 as compared with the prior year period contributing 3.1 million to the increase, and price/product mix increased 10.1 which contributed 10.8 million to the increase. The increase in net
 sales was driven primarily by 9.0 million of growth in modern oral product FRE and 5.8 million of growth in Stoker s MST, partially offset by a 0.9 million decline in loose-leaf chewing tobacco.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales in the Creative Distribution Solutions segment decreased 22.1 million, or 33.3 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net
 sales was primarily the result of reduced sales volumes in the liquid nicotine distribution business contributing 22.4 million to the decrease, and our strategic decision to eliminate certain unprofitable brands and to focus on a narrower set of
 products.

Gross Profit: For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated gross profit increased 6.7 million, or 4.4 compared to the prior year period. Gross
 profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 51.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 49.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increased margins as the Creative Distribution Solutions
 segment became a smaller part of the overall company.

 sales decreased to 55.9 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 56.3 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of product mix as the growth in our modern oral product FRE, which generates lower
 margins as compared with other products in the Stoker s products segment, outpaced the growth of MST.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit in the Creative Distribution Solutions segment decreased 6.8 million, or 39.9 compared to the prior year period. Gross profit as a
 percentage of net sales decreased to 23.3 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 25.9 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of sales channel mix as business-to-business net
 sales, which generate lower margins than business-to-consumer sales, increased to 83 of net segment sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 78 of net segment sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses: For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 4.5
 million, or 4.8 , compared to the prior year period. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included 5.7 million of stock options, restricted stock and incentives expense, 3.1 million of expense

 CRM systems, 0.2 million of expense related to corporate restructuring and 0.2 million related to transaction costs.

 federal excise tax refund of 1.7 million received in the first half of 2024.

Operating Income (Loss): For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated operating income increased 3.9 million, or 6.7 compared to the prior year
 period. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 20.1 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.0 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increased gross profit in
 the Zig-Zag and Stoker s products segments partially offset by decreased gross profit in the Creative Distribution Solutions segment.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating income in the Zig-Zag products segment increased 6.3 million, or 13.4 compared to the prior year period. Operating income
 as a percentage of net sales increased to 17.2 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 15.3 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven b y increased gross profit in our Canadian
 products business and U.S. papers and wraps products.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating income in the Stoker s products segment increased 5.0 million, or 11.1 compared to the prior year period. Operating income
 as a percentage of net sales increased to 16.2 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.7 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by Stoker s MST net sales growth at higher
 margins and higher net sales of FRE. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating income in the Creative Distribution Solutions segment decreased 0.6 million, or 248.7 compared to the prior year period driven by a
 decline in gross profit that was not matched with cost savings. Operating income (loss) as a percentage of net sales remained steady at (0.1) of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Included in consolidated operating income are costs of the Company which are not assigned to one of the three reportable segments and includes: (i) corporate overhead
 expense, including executive management, finance, legal and information technology salaries, and professional services, such as audit, external legal costs and information technology services, as well as (ii) costs related to the FDA premarket
 tobacco product application. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, unallocated costs were 41.1 million compared to 34.3 million in the prior year period, an increase of 6.8 million or 19.8 , primarily driven by an increase of 2.0
 million related to PMTA, an increase of 1.5 million of restructuring expense, an increase of 1.1 million of stock compensation expense and an increase of 0.8 million of transaction costs.

Interest Expense, net: For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense, net decreased 1.8 million compared to the prior year period as a result
 of the repurchases of 44.0 million of Convertible Senior Notes in 2023, the maturity of the Convertible Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2024, and increased interest income on cash as a result of rising interest rates.

Investment Loss: For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investment loss decreased to 2.1 million compared to 11.0 million for the nine months ended
 September 30, 2023. The change is primarily the result of impairment charges recognized on our investments in Bomani for 1.8 million and Old Pal for 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to impairment charges in
 Docklight for 8.7 million and Wild Hempettes for 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Income Tax Expense: Our income tax expense of 12.7 million was 25.4 of income before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our
 effective income tax rate was 25.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, we use non-U.S. GAAP financial measures
 including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted
 EBITDA is used by management to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes and is presented to our Board of Directors. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate measures of operating
 performance because they eliminate the impact of expenses that do not relate to operating performance. In addition, our debt instruments contain covenants which use Adjusted EBITDA calculations.

We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income
 before interest expense, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, other non-cash items, and other items we do not consider the ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance
 noted in the reconciliation below. Among other items that we adjust Adjusted EBITDA for is FDA PMTA expense. The Company believes it is appropriate to adjust for this spend as the costs are incurred in connection with what we view as a
 non-traditional regulatory process that requires applications be submitted for covered products that are already on the market. As a result, Company s management believes it is most appropriate to assess the performance of the Company s business 
 the sale of our various products - without regard to these costs and believes that adjusting for these costs provides investors and the public markets with the most meaningful metrics to assess performance of the business.

Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA excludes significant expenses
 required to be recorded in our financial statements by U.S. GAAP and is subject to inherent limitations. Other companies in our industry may calculate this non-U.S. GAAP measure differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, limiting its
 usefulness as a comparative measure. The tables below provide reconciliations between net income and Adjusted EBITDA.

 however, due to the nature of the implementation process for those product lines already in the market, applications can take multiple years to complete rather than the typical one-time submission. The Company currently has only two product

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of September 30, 2024, we have 33.6 million of cash on hand and have 58.8 million of availability under the 2023 ABL Facility. Our principal uses for cash are working capital, debt service,
 and capital expenditures.

Our Convertible Senior Notes matured on July 15, 2024 and were retired with cash. We have no borrowings outstanding under our ABL as of September 30, 2024.

Our adjusted working capital, which we define as current assets less cash and current liabilities, increased 57.9 million compared to the prior year end. The increase in working capital is
 primarily a result of a 60.2 million decrease in current liabilities due to the July 15, 2024 maturity of our Convertible Senior Notes which were retired with cash on that date. With our strong cash balance, free cash flow generation and borrowing
 availability under the 2023 ABL Facility, we expect to have ample liquidity to satisfy our operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 49.3 million, an increase of 9.3 million compared to the prior year period, primarily
 due to an increase in net income, net of non-cash items of 4.6 million, and an increase in the change in other current assets of 4.5 million. The primary drivers of non-cash items were a 8.4 million decrease in loss on investments
 compared to the prior year period, partially offset by a 1.1 million increase in stock compensation expense and a 1.8 million decrease in gains on extinguishment of debt compared to the prior year period. The increase in cash from other current
 assets was primarily driven by the Berteau settlement receivable of 4.0 million and an insurance deposit receivable of 3.0 million, both received in cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 9.1 million, an increase of 4.7 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the net
 purchase of 4.3 million in investments by our captive insurance subsidiary.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 127.5 million, an increase of 81.6 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a 118.5
 million cash payment for retirement of the Convertible Senior Notes and for the repurchase of common stock of 4.2 million during the period in 2024, partially offset by 41.8 million in repurchases of Convertible Senior Notes that occurred during
 the same period in 2023.

 Directors increased the approved share repurchase program by 30.7 million, and by 24.6 million on February 24, 2022, in each case bringing the aggregate approval back to 50.0 million. On November 6, 2024, the Board of Directors of the

Senior Secured Notes

On February 11, 2021, we closed a private offering (the Offering of 250 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.625 senior secured notes due 2026 (the Senior Secured Notes ). The
 Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.625 and will mature on February 15, 2026. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on August 15, 2021.We used
 the proceeds from the Offering (i) to repay all obligations under and terminate the 2018 First Lien Credit Facility, (ii) to pay related fees, costs, and expenses and (iii) for general corporate purposes.

Obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed by the Company s existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (the Guarantors that guarantee any credit facility (as
 defined in the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or capital markets debt securities of the Company or Guarantors in excess of 15.0 million. The Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees
 are secured by first-priority liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions.

The Company may redeem the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at any time, at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount to be redeemed) set forth below,
 plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed to (but not including) the applicable redemption date if redeemed during the period indicated below:

On or after February 15, 2024

101.406 

On or after February 15, 2025 and thereafter

100.000 

If we experience a change of control (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture), we must offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101 of the
 principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Table of Contents 

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) grant or incur liens; (ii) incur, assume or
 guarantee additional indebtedness; (iii) sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; (iv) make certain investments; (v) pay dividends, make distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock; (vi) engage in
 certain transactions with affiliates; and (vii) consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to another entity. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions set forth in the Senior Secured
 Notes Indenture. For instance, the Company is generally permitted to make restricted payments, including the payment of dividends to shareholders, provided that, at the time of payment, or as a result of payment, the Company is not in default on
 its debt covenants; however, there are earnings and market capitalization requirements that if not met could limit the aggregate amount of quarterly dividends payable during a fiscal year. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides for customary
 events of default. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024.

We incurred debt issuance costs attributable to the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes of 6.4 million which are amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over the expected
 life of the Senior Secured Notes.

2021 Revolving Credit Facility

In connection with the Offering, we also entered into a 25.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility with the lenders party thereto and Barclays
 Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent (in such capacity, the Agent ). This facility was terminated in November 2023 in connection with the entry by a subsidiary of the Company in a new asset-backed revolving credit facility.
 See 2023 ABL Facility below. We incurred debt issuance costs attributable to the issuance of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility of 0.5 million, with the remaining 0.2 million written off to gain on debt extinguishment upon termination of the
 facility in November 2023.

2023 ABL Facility

On November 7, 2023, TPB Specialty Finance, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the ABL Borrower ), entered into a new 75.0 million asset-backed revolving credit facility (the
 2023 ABL Facility ), with the several lenders thereunder, and Barclays Bank Plc, as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent and as collateral agent (the Collateral Agent and First-Citizens Bank Trust Company as additional
 collateral agent (the Additional Collateral Agent ). Under the 2023 ABL Facility, the ABL Borrower may draw up to 75.0 million under Revolving Credit Loans and Last In Last Out LILO Loans. The 2023 ABL Facility includes a 40.0 million
 accordion feature. In connection with the 2023 ABL Facility, Turning Point Brands contributed certain existing inventory to the ABL Borrower. The 2023 ABL Facility is secured on a first priority basis (subject to customary exceptions) by all
 assets of the ABL Borrower.

The 2023 ABL Facility contains customary borrowing conditions including a borrowing base equal to the sum of (a) the lesser of (1) 85 of the lower of (A) the market value (on a first in first
 out basis) of the sum of eligible inventory, plus eligible in-transit inventory of the ABL Borrower and (B) 85 of the cost of the sum of eligible inventory, plus eligible in-transit inventory of the ABL Borrower and (2) 85 of the net orderly

 sum of eligible inventory, plus eligible in-transit inventory and (2) 10 of the NOLV percentage of the lower of (1)(A) or (1)(B); plus (b) 10 of the face amount of eligible account; minus (c) the amount of all eligible reserves.

Amounts borrowed under the 2023 ABL Facility are subject to an interest rate margin per annum equal to (a) from and after the closing date until the last day of the first full fiscal quarter

 (ii) 3.25 per annum, in the case of LILO loans that are SOFR loans, (c) on the first day of each fiscal quarter, the applicable interest rate margins will be determined from the pricing grid below based upon the historical excess availability for

The 2023 ABL Facility also requires the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 as of the end of any four consecutive fiscal
 quarters if excess availability is less than the greater of (a) 12.5 of the line cap and (b) 9.4 million, at any time and continuing until excess availability is equal to or exceeds the greater of (i) 12.5 of the line and (ii) 9.4 million for
 thirty (30) consecutive calendar days with the 9.4 million level automatically increased in proportion to the amount of any increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments thereunder in connection with any incremental facility.

The 2023 ABL Facility will mature on the earlier of (x) November 7, 2027 and (y) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of any material debt of the ABL Borrower or the Company or
 any of its restricted subsidiaries (subject to customary extensions agreed by the lenders thereunder); provided that clause (y) will not apply to the extent that on any applicable date of determination (on any date prior to the date set forth in
 clause (y)), (A) the sum of (x) cash that is held in escrow for the repayment of such material debt pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (y) cash that is held in accounts with the Administrative Agent and/or the
 Additional Collateral Agent, plus (z) excess availability, is sufficient to repay such material debt and (B) the ABL Borrower has excess availability of at least 15.0 million after giving effect to such repayment of material debt, including any
 borrowings under the commitments in connection therewith.

The Company has not drawn any borrowings under the 2023 ABL Facility but has letters of credit of approximately 2.3 million outstanding under the facility and has an available balance of 58.8
 million based on the borrowing base as of September 30, 2024.

The Company incurred debt issuance costs attributable to the 2023 ABL Facility of 2.6 million which are amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over the expected life of the
 2023 ABL Facility.

Convertible Senior Notes

In July 2019, the Company closed an offering of 172.5 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2.50 Convertible Senior Notes due July 15, 2024 (the Convertible Senior Notes ). The
 Convertible Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.50 per year, payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2020. The Convertible Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company.

In 2023, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company repurchased 44.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes on the open market resulting in a gain on the
 extinguishment of debt for 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Including amounts repurchased in 2022, a total of 54.0 million of repurchased notes were retired on July 1, 2024, with no principal amounts remaining outstanding
 as of September 30, 2024.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we executed and have outstanding various foreign exchange contracts for the purchase and sale of 1.5 million with maturity dates ranging from
 October to December 2024. The fair value of the foreign currency contracts were based on quoted market prices and resulted in an asset of 0.0 million included in Other current assets and a liability of 0.0 million included in Accrued liabilities
 at September 30, 2024. During 2023, we executed various foreign exchange contracts for the purchase of 20.1 million and sale of 15.2 million. At December 31, 2023, we had foreign currency contracts outstanding for the purchase of 15.2 million
 and sale of 15.2 million. The fair value of the foreign currency contracts were based on quoted market prices and resulted in an asset of 0.3 million included in Other current assets and a liability of 0.1 million included in Accrued liabilities
 at December 31, 2023.

Inflation

Inflation in general, coupled with increases in gas prices have had a substantial negative effect on the purchasing power of consumers. While historically, we have been able to increase prices at
 a rate equal to or greater than that of inflation, doing so would be difficult in the current inflationary environment. However, we have implemented price increases in areas where doing so has been feasible. In addition, we have been able to
 maintain a relatively stable variable cost structure for our products due, in part, to our successful procurement regarding our tobacco products and, in part, to our existing contractual agreement for the purchase of our premium cigarette papers.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Foreign Currency Sensitivity

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in our exposure to exchange rate fluctuation risk, as reported within our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please
 refer to our Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.

Credit Risk

There have been no material changes in our exposure to credit risk, as reported within our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Please refer to our
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

In February 2021, we issued the Senior Secured Notes in an aggregate principal amount of 250 million. We carry the Senior Secured Notes at face value. Since the Senior Secured Notes bear
 interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Our remaining debt instrument is the 2023 ABL Facility, which has no borrowing outstanding.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision, and with the participation of, our management including our Chief Executive Officer CEO ), Chief Financial Officer CFO ), and Chief
 Accounting Officer CAO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934), as of September 30, 2024. Based upon the
 evaluation, our CEO, CFO, and CAO concluded our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of such date solely due to material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form
 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, during our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
 financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective solely due to the existence of the following material weakness:

We did not design and maintain effective internal controls related to our information technology general controls ITGCs in the areas of user access and program
 change-management over certain information technology IT systems that support the Company s financial reporting processes. Our business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed
 ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. We believe that these control deficiencies were a result of: IT control processes lacking sufficient documentation such that the successful operation of ITGCs was overly dependent upon
 knowledge and actions of certain individuals with IT expertise and inherent system limitations.

The material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to our financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. The material weakness will
 not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded through testing that these controls are operating effectively.

Remediation Plan

While our remediation plan may evolve and expand, management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material
 weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: (i) completion of the current implementation of a new ERP system in 2025; (ii) utilizing third-party
 consultants to help review, plan and implement systems and tools designed to assist with remediation processes; (iii) developing and maintaining documentation underlying ITGCs; (iv) implementing an IT management review and testing plan to monitor
 ITGCs with a specific focus on systems supporting our financial reporting processes; and (v) enhanced quarterly reporting on the remediation measures to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

We believe that these actions will ultimately remediate the material weakness. The material weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a
 sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.
