 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

We re-evaluate the fair value of such receivables
at the close of each measurement period. If the reevaluation were to yield a value materially different from the recorded value, an adjustment
would be required. 

Anticipated credit losses are included in our
estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. In accordance with the fair value accounting standards, credit losses
are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield, therefore we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses,
as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also, because we include anticipated
credit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable
to the receivables. Because our initial recorded value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual
principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of
acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,
"Income Taxes (Topic 740)," which is intended to provide greater transparency in various income tax components that affect the
rate reconciliation based on the applicable taxing jurisdictions, as well as the qualitative and quantitative aspects of those components.
This new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09; however, at the current time, the Company does not believe this ASU will
have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, have been placed on non-accrual status as a result of their delinquency
status. 

Allowance for Credit Losses
 Finance Receivables 

The allowance for credit losses
is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of finance receivables to present the net amount expected to be
collected. Charge offs are deducted from the allowance when management believes that collectability is unlikely. 

Management estimates the allowance
using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and, reasonable
and supportable forecasts. We believe our historical credit loss experience provides the best basis for the estimation of expected credit
losses. Consequently, we use historical loss experience for older receivables, aggregated into vintage pools based on their calendar quarter
of origination, to forecast expected losses for less seasoned quarterly vintage pools. 

We measure the weighted average monthly
incremental change in cumulative net losses for the vintage pools in the relevant historical period. For the pools in the relevant historical
period, we consider each pool s performance from its inception through the end of the current period. We then apply the results
of the historical analysis to less seasoned vintage pools beginning with each vintage pool s most recent actual cumulative net
loss experience and extrapolating from that point based on the historical data. We believe the pattern and magnitude of losses on older
vintages allows us to establish a reasonable and supportable forecast of less seasoned vintages. 

Our contract purchase guidelines
are designed to produce a homogenous portfolio. For key credit characteristics of individual contracts such as obligor credit history,
job stability, residence stability and ability to pay, there is relatively little variation from the average for the portfolio. Similarly,
for key structural characteristics such as loan-to-value, length of contract, monthly payment and amount financed, there is relatively
little variation from the average for the portfolio. Consequently, we do not believe there are significant differences in risk characteristics
between various segments of our portfolio. 

Our methodology incorporates
historical pools that are sufficiently seasoned to capture the magnitude and trends of losses within those vintage pools. Furthermore,
the historical period encompasses a substantial volume of receivables over periods that include fluctuations in the competitive landscape,
the Company s rates of growth, size of our managed portfolio and fluctuations in economic growth and unemployment. 

In consideration of the depth
and breadth of the historical period, and the homogeneity of our portfolio, we generally do not adjust historical loss information for
differences in risk characteristics such as credit or structural composition of segments of the portfolio or for changes in environmental
conditions such as changes in unemployment rates, collateral values or other factors. Throughout our history we have observed how events
such as extreme weather, political unrest, and other qualitative factors have influenced the performance of our portfolio. Consequently,
we have considered how such qualitative factors may affect future credit losses and have incorporated our judgement of the effect of those
factors into our estimates. 

The following table presents the amortized cost
basis of our finance receivables by annual vintage as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Debt issuance costs of 
million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, have been excluded from the table above. These
debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Securitization trust debt on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. 

All of the securitization trust
debt was sold in private placement transactions to qualified institutional buyers. The debt was issued through our wholly-owned bankruptcy
remote subsidiaries and is secured by the assets of such subsidiaries, but not by our other assets. 

The terms of the securitization
agreements related to the issuance of the securitization trust debt and the warehouse credit facilities require that we meet certain delinquency
and credit loss criteria with respect to the pool of receivables, and certain of the agreements require that we maintain minimum levels
of liquidity and not exceed maximum leverage levels. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants. 

We are responsible for the administration
and collection of the automobile contracts. The securitization agreements also require certain funds be held in restricted cash accounts
to provide additional collateral for the borrowings, to be applied to make payments on the securitization trust debt or as pre-funding
proceeds from a term securitization prior to the purchase of additional collateral. As of September 30, 2024, restricted cash under the
various agreements totaled approximately 271.0 million. Interest expense on the securitization trust debt consists of the stated rate
of interest plus amortization of additional costs of borrowing. Additional costs of borrowing include facility fees, amortization of deferred
financing costs and discounts on notes sold. Deferred financing costs and discounts on notes sold related to the securitization trust
debt are amortized using a level yield method. Accordingly, the effective cost of the securitization trust debt is greater than the contractual
rate of interest disclosed above. 

Our wholly-owned bankruptcy remote subsidiaries
were formed to facilitate the above asset-backed financing transactions. Similar bankruptcy remote subsidiaries issue the debt outstanding
under our credit facilities. Bankruptcy remote refers to a legal structure in which it is expected that the applicable entity would not
be included in any bankruptcy filing by its parent or affiliates. All of the assets of these subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral
for the related debt. All such transactions, treated as secured financings for accounting and tax purposes, are treated as sales for all
other purposes, including legal and bankruptcy purposes. None of the assets of these subsidiaries are available to pay other creditors.

On July 11, 2024, we renewed our two-year 
million revolving credit agreement with Citibank, N.A. The revolving period for this facility was extended to July 2026 followed by an
amortization period through July 2027 for any receivables pledged at the end of the revolving period. There was million outstanding
under this facility at September 30, 2024. 

On March 29, 2024, we renewed our two-year 
million revolving credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. The revolving period for this facility was extended to March 2026 followed
by an amortization period through March 2028 for any receivables pledged at the end of the revolving period. There was amount outstanding
under this facility at September 30, 2024. 

On March 22, 2024, we completed a million
securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In the transaction, a qualified institutional buyer purchased
 .0 million of asset-backed notes secured by an 80 interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in five CPS securitizations
issued from January 2022 through January 2023. The sold notes 2024-1 Notes ), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2024-1,
consist of a single class with a coupon of 11.50 . At September 30, 2024 there was .0 million outstanding under this facility. 

Unamortized debt issuance costs of and
 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, have been excluded from the amount reported above for residual
interest financing. Similarly, unamortized debt issuance costs of million and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, respectively, have been excluded from the Warehouse lines of credit amounts in the table above. These debt issuance costs are presented
as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the debt on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

If the anti-dilutive effects

periods ended September 30, 2024 would have included an additional million and million shares, respectively, attributable to the
exercise of outstanding options and warrants. For the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, million shares,
would be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. 

The Company and its subsidiaries
file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined or stand-alone state franchise tax returns for certain states. We utilize the
asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

Deferred tax assets are recognized
subject to management s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax
asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not
be realized. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Although realization
is not assured, we believe that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of million as of September 30, 2024 is more
likely than not based on forecasted future net earnings. Our net deferred tax asset of million consists of approximately 
of net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and of net state deferred tax assets.

In General.
 There can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record
at each measurement date, most recently as of September 30, 2024, our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies,
including the matters identified above. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However,
based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of September
30, 2024 is million, and that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including
those described or identified above, as of September 30, 2024 does not exceed million. 

Accordingly,
we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings there can be no assurance
that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among

Item 2 . Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 

We are a specialty finance
company. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and,
to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger
vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories
or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating
sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions
and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts
directly from dealers, we have also (i) originated vehicle purchase money loans by lending directly to consumers, (ii) acquired installment
purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, and (iii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans
from non-affiliated lenders. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as "automobile contracts." 

We were incorporated and
began our operations in March 1991. From inception through September 30, 2024, we have originated a total of approximately 22.6 billion
of automobile contracts, primarily by purchasing retail installment sales contracts from dealers, and to a lesser degree, by originating
loans secured by automobiles directly with consumers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately 822.3 million of automobile
contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. Recent contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels are
shown in the table below:

In May 2021 we began purchasing
some contracts for immediate sale to a third-party to whom we refer applications that don t meet our lending criteria. We service
all such contracts on behalf of the third-party. We earn fees for originating the receivable and also servicing fees on active accounts
in the third-party portfolio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we originated 29.5 million under this third-party program.
As of September 30, 2024, our managed portfolio includes 191.5 million of such third-party receivables. 

Our principal executive offices
are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting
functions are performed primarily in that California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida, Nevada, and
Virginia branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches. 

The programs we offer to dealers
and consumers are intended to serve a wide range of sub-prime customers, primarily through franchised new car dealers. We originate automobile
contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which
we sell a specified pool of contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours, which in turn issues asset-backed securities to fund the
purchase of the pool of contracts from us. 

28 

Securitization and Warehouse Credit Facilities 

Throughout the period for which
information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis
through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification
of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries,
and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may
be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. All of
our active securitizations are structured as secured financings. 

When structured to be treated as a secured financing
for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear
as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income
on the contracts, and (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction. For automobile contracts acquired after
2017 we take account of estimated credit losses in our computation of a level yield used to determine recognition of interest on the contracts.
For contracts acquired before 2018, we adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 and we may, as circumstances warrant, record or reverse expense
provisions for credit losses. 

Since 1994 we have conducted
103 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated. As of September 30, 2024, 18 of those securitizations are active
and all are structured as secured financings. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each
calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April
2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which
our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020. 

Our recent history of term securitizations
is summarized in the table below:

Generally, prior to a securitization
transaction we fund our automobile contract purchases primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. We currently have short-term
funding capacity of 400 million over two credit facilities. The first credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was
most recently renewed in July 2024, extending the revolving period to July 2026, with an optional amortization period through July 2027.
In addition, the capacity was doubled from 100 million to 200 million in July 2022. 

In November 2015, we entered
into another 100 million facility. This facility was most recently renewed in March 2024, extending the revolving period to March 2026,
followed by an amortization period to March 2028. In June 2022, we doubled the capacity for this facility from 100 million to 200 million. 

29 

In a securitization and in
our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations
and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or
warranties, we will be obligated to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid
interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at
a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will
bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. 

In a securitization, the related
special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts
falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An
unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both
our liquidity and results of operations. 

Receivables we originate and
service for third-parties are not pledged to our warehouse facilities or included in our securitizations. 

Financial Covenants 

Certain of our securitization
transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results.
Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain
of our debt agreements other than our term securitizations contain cross-default provisions. Such cross-default provisions would allow
the respective creditors to declare a default if an event of default occurred with respect to other indebtedness of ours, but only if
such other event of default were to be accompanied by acceleration of such other indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance
with all such covenants. 

Results
of Operations 

Comparison of Operating Results
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 with the three months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues . During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our revenues were 100.6 million, an increase of 8.5 million, or 9.2 , from the prior year
revenue of 92.1 million. The primary reason for the increase in revenues is the increase in interest income resulting from the increase
in the average outstanding balance of finance receivables measured at fair value. Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024
include a 5.5 million mark up to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. The marks are estimates based
on our evaluation of the appropriate fair value and future earnings rate of existing receivables compared to recently acquired receivables
and increases or decreases in our estimates of future net losses. In the current period, our re-evaluation of the fair values of these
receivables resulted in a mark up for certain older receivables and a mark down to the fair values of newer receivables. The fair value
mark up on the older receivables exceeded the mark down to the newer receivables resulting in a net mark up of 5.5 million. There was
a 6.0 million mark up to the fair value portfolio in the prior year period. 

Interest income for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 increased 9.9 million, or 11.9 , to 93.2 million from 83.3 million in the prior year. The primary reason
for the increase in interest income is the 11.7 increase in the average balance of our loan portfolio over the prior year period. The
interest yield on our total loan portfolio increased from 11.3 in the prior year period to 11.4 in the current year period. The interest
yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other
finance receivables. The table below shows the average balance and interest yield of our loan portfolio for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023:

30 

Other income was 1.9 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024 compared to 2.8 million for the comparable period in 2023. This 31.8 decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in origination
and servicing fees we earned from third party receivables. These fees were 1.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared
to 2.5 million in the prior year period. 

Expenses . Our operating expenses
consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provision
for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolio
of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the internal rate of return
or the recorded value applicable to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts
we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those
contracts. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received,
processed and serviced. Factors that affect profit margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market
environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. 

Employee costs include base
salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options
and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with
the level of applications and automobile contracts purchased and serviced. 

Other operating expenses consist
largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertising
expenses, and depreciation and amortization. 

Total operating expenses were
 93.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 77.9 million for the prior period, an increase of 15.8 million,
or 20.4 . The increase is primarily due to increases in interest expense and to a lesser extent, increases to employee costs. 

Employee costs were 24.2 million
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.8 million for the same quarter in the prior year, an increase of 2.4
million, or 10.8 . The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio
as of, and for the three-month periods ended, September 30, 2024 and 2023:

General and administrative expenses
include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit
services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses was 13.3 million, an increase of 231,000 from 13.0 million in
the prior year period. 

Interest expense for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 was 50.1 million and represented 53.4 of total operating expenses, compared to 37.9 million in the
previous year, when it was 48.7 of total operating expenses. 

Interest on securitization trust
debt increased by 11.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period. The average balance of securitization
trust debt increased to 2,706.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,349.7 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The annualized average rate on our securitization trust debt was 6.4 for the three months ended September 30,
2024 compared to 5.4 in the prior year period. The blended interest rates on new term securitizations have been increasing since 2022.
For each quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market
interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that
investors are willing to accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These
and other factors have resulted in fluctuations in our securitization trust debt interest costs. The blended interest rates of our recent
securitizations are summarized in the table below:

Interest expense on warehouse
credit line debt decreased by 665,000 to 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.7 million in the prior
year period. The decrease was primarily due to the lower utilization of our credit lines during the quarter compared to last year. The
average balance of our warehouse debt was 132.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 170.9 million for
the same period in 2023. The annualized average rate on our credit line debt was 12.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to 10.9 in the prior year period. 

Interest expense on subordinated
renewable notes was 581,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average balance of the outstanding subordinated debt was
 23.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19.9 million for the prior year period. The average yield of
subordinated notes increased to 10.0 compared to 8.8 in the prior period. 

32 

In June 2021, we completed a
residual interest financing of our residual interests from previously issued securitizations in the amount of 50.0 million. In March
2024, we completed a new residual interest financing of our residual interests from previously issued securitizations in the amount of
 50.0 million. Interest expense for these residual interest financings was 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024
compared to 1.1 for the same period in 2023.

Our evaluation of the allowance for credit losses indicated that the reserves against future losses are adequate
as of September 30, 2024. The allowance applies only to our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as
our legacy portfolio. Finance receivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted
for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision
for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. 

For the three months ended September
30, 2024, we recorded a reduction to provision for credit losses on finance receivables in the amount of 994,000. The reserve decrease
was primarily due to better than expected recovery rates and a decrease in lifetime expected credit losses resulting from improved credit
performance as our previous estimates for future losses exceeded actual incurred losses. This compares to 2.0 million in reductions to
provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Sales expenses consist primarily
of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissions
based on volume of contract purchases. Sales expense increased to 5.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.3
million for the same quarter in 2023. We purchased 445.9 million of new contracts during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to 322.4 million in the prior year period. 

Occupancy expenses was 1.3
million for the three months ending September 30, 2024, which is down from the 1.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. 

Depreciation and amortization
expenses increased to 214,000 compared to 199,000 in the previous year. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we recorded income tax expense of 2.1 million, representing a 30 effective tax rate. In the prior period, our income tax expense was
 3.8 million, representing a 27 effective tax rate.

Comparison of Operating Results for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues . During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenues were 288.2 million, an increase of 28.2 million, or 10.8 , from the prior year
revenue of 260.0 million. The primary reason for the increase in revenues is the increase in interest income resulting from the increase
in the average outstanding balance of finance receivables measured at fair value. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
include a 16.0 million mark up to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. The marks are estimates based
on our evaluation of the appropriate fair value and future earnings rate of existing receivables compared to recently acquired receivables
and increases or decreases in our estimates of future net losses. In the current period, our re-evaluation of the fair values of these
receivables resulted in a mark up for certain older receivables and a mark down to the fair values of newer receivables. The fair value
mark up on the older receivables exceeded the mark down to the newer receivables resulting in a net mark up of 16.0 million. There was
 6.0 mark up to the fair value portfolio in the prior year period. 

Interest income for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 increased 19.8 million, or 8.1 , to 265.8 million from 246.0 million in the prior year. The primary
reason for the increase in interest income is the 8.0 increase in the average balance of our loan portfolio over the prior year period.
The interest yield on our total loan portfolio is 11.3 in the current year period and prior year period. The interest yield on receivables
measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables.
The table below shows the average balance and interest yield of our loan portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Other income was 6.4 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.1 million for the comparable period in 2023.
This 20.9 decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in origination and servicing fees we earned from third party receivables. These
fees were 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.2 million in the prior year period. 

Expenses . Our operating expenses
consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provision
for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolio
of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the internal rate of return
or the recorded value applicable to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts
we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those
contracts. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received,
processed and serviced. Factors that affect profit margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market
environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. 

Employee costs include base
salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options
and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with
the level of applications and automobile contracts purchased and serviced. 

35 

Other operating expenses consist
largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertising
expenses, and depreciation and amortization. 

Total operating expenses were
 268.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 208.8 million for the prior period, an increase of 59.3 million,
or 28.4 . The increase is primarily due to increases in interest expense and a decrease in the reduction to provision for credit losses.
To a lesser extent, increases to employee costs and general and administrative expenses also contributed to the increase in operating
expenses during the period. 

Employee costs were 72.3 million
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 65.0 million for the same period in the prior year. The table below summarizes
our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the nine-month periods ended,

an increase of 4.1 million from 36.2 million in the prior year period. 

Interest expense for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 was 138.7 million, compared to 106.4 million in the previous year, an increase of 32.3 million. 

36 

Interest on securitization trust
debt increased by 29.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period. The average balance of securitization
trust debt increased to 2,549.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,322.0 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The annualized average rate on our securitization trust debt was 6.1 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 compared to 5.0 in the prior year period. The blended interest rates on new term securitizations have been increasing since 2022.
For each quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market
interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that
investors are willing to accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These
and other factors have resulted in fluctuations in our securitization trust debt interest costs. The blended interest rates of our recent
securitizations are summarized in the table below:

Interest expense on warehouse
credit line debt decreased by 499,000 to 14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.5 million in the
prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the lower utilization of our credit lines during the quarter compared to last year.
The average balance of our warehouse debt was 170.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 186.3 million
for the same period in 2023. The annualized average rate on our credit line debt was 11.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
compared to 10.4 in the prior year period. 

Interest expense on subordinated
renewable notes was 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average balance of outstanding subordinated debt was
 22.1 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, consistent with the prior year. The average yield of subordinated notes increased
to 9.8 compared to 8.6 in the prior period. 

In June 2021, we completed a
residual interest financing of our residual interests from previously issued securitizations in the amount of 50.0 million. In March
2024, we completed a new residual interest financing of our residual interests from previously issued securitizations in the amount of
 50.0 million. Interest expense on the residual interest financing was 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to 3.2 million for the same period in 2023.

Our evaluation of the allowance for credit losses indicated that the reserves against future losses are adequate
as of September 30, 2024. The allowance applies only to our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as
our legacy portfolio. Finance receivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted
for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision
for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, we recorded a reduction to provision for credit losses on finance receivables in the amount of 4.6 million. The reserve decrease
was primarily due to better than expected recovery rates and a decrease in lifetime expected credit losses resulting from improved credit
performance as our previous estimates for future losses exceeded actual incurred losses. This compares to 20.7 million in reductions
to provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Sales expenses consist primarily
of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissions
based on volume of contract purchases. Sales expenses remained consistent at 16.5 million for both the nine months ending September 30,
2024, and the same period last year. We purchased 1,224.1 million of new contracts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to 1,056.0 million in the prior year period. 

Occupancy expenses was 4.3
million for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, which is down from 4.8 million for the same period in 2023. 

Depreciation and amortization
expenses decreased to 650,000 compared to 642,000 in the previous year. 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 6.0 million, representing a 30 effective tax rate. In the prior
period, our income tax expense was 13.1 million, representing a 26 effective tax rate. 

Credit Experience 

Our financial results are dependent
on the performance of the automobile contracts in which we retain an ownership interest. Broad economic factors such as recession and
significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the
receivables at any given time. The tables below document the delinquency, repossession and net credit loss experience of all such automobile
contracts that we originated or own an interest in as of the respective dates shown.

 (1) All amounts and percentages are based
on the amount remaining to be repaid on each automobile contract. The information in the table represents the gross principal amount
of all automobile contracts we have purchased, including automobile contracts subsequently sold in securitization transactions that we
continue to service. The table does not include certain contracts we have serviced for third parties on which we earn servicing fees
only and have no credit risk. 

 (2) We consider an automobile contract delinquent
when an obligor fails to make at least 90 of a contractually due payment by the following due date, which date may have been extended
within limits specified in the Servicing Agreements. The period of delinquency is based on the number of days payments are contractually
past due. Automobile contracts less than 31 days delinquent are not included. The delinquency aging categories shown in the tables reflect
the effect of extensions. 

 (3) Amount in repossession represents financed
vehicles that have been repossessed but not yet liquidated.

Extensions 

In
certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions to assist them with temporary cash flow problems. In general,
we are bound by our securitization agreements to refrain from agreeing to more than two such extensions in any 12-month period and to
more than eight over the life of the contract. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor s next due date by one month
and extend the maturity date of the receivable by one month. In some cases, a two-month extension may be granted. There are no other concessions
such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. 

The
basic question in deciding to grant an extension is whether or not we will (a) be delaying the inevitable repossession and liquidation
or (b) risk losing the vehicle as a result of not being able to locate the obligor and vehicle. In both of those situations, the loss
would likely be higher than if the vehicle had been repossessed without the extension. The benefits of granting an extension include minimizing
current losses and delinquencies, minimizing lifetime losses, getting the obligor s account current (or close to it) and building
goodwill so that the obligor might prioritize us over other creditors on future payments. Our servicing staff are trained to identify
when a past due obligor is facing a temporary problem that may be resolved with an extension. In some cases, the extension will be granted
in conjunction with our receiving all or a portion of a past due payment from the obligor, thereby indicating an additional monetary and
psychological commitment to the contract on the obligor s part. 

The
credit assessment for granting an extension is initially made by our collector, who bases the recommendation on the collector s
discussions with the obligor. In such assessments the collector will consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) the reason
the obligor has fallen behind in payment; (2) whether or not the reason for the delinquency is temporary, and if it is, have conditions
changed such that the obligor can begin making regular monthly payments again after the extension; (3) the obligor's past payment history,
including past extensions if applicable; (4) the obligor s willingness to communicate and cooperate on resolving the delinquency;
and (5) a numeric score from our internal risk assessment system that indicating the likelihood that the extension will prove beneficial.
If the collector believes the obligor is a good candidate for an extension, an approval is obtained from a supervisor, who will review
the same factors stated above prior to offering the extension to the obligor. After receiving an extension, an account remains subject
to our normal policies and procedures for interest accrual, reporting delinquency and recognizing charge-offs. 

41 

We
believe that a prudent extension program is an integral component to mitigating losses in our portfolio of sub-prime automobile receivables.
The table below summarizes the status, as of September 30, 2024, for accounts that received extensions from 2010 through 2023: 

Period of Extension 
 
 # Extensions Granted 
 
 Active or Paid Off at September 30, 2024 
 
 Active or Paid Off at September 30, 2024 
 
 Charged Off > 6 Months After Extension 
 
 Charged Off > 6 Months After Extension 
 
 Charged Off ______________________ 

 Note: Table excludes extensions on portfolios
serviced for third parties 

We
view these results as a confirmation of the effectiveness of our extension program. For example, of the accounts granted extensions in
2019, 61.2 were either paid in full or active and performing as of September 30, 2024. Each of these successful accounts represent continued
payments of interest and principal (including payment in full in many cases), where without the extension we likely would have incurred
a substantial loss and no interest revenue after the extension. 

42 

For the extension accounts that
ultimately charge off, we consider any that charged off more than six months after the extension to be at least partially successful.
For example, of the accounts granted extensions in 2018 that subsequently charged off, such charge offs occurred, on average, 20 months
after the extension, indicating that even in the cases of an ultimate loss, the obligor serviced the account with additional payments
of principal and interest.

Since 2019, we have been able to reduce extensions
by working with our servicing staff to be more selective in granting extensions including, where appropriate, to exhaust all possibilities
of payment by the customer before granting an extension. However, as delinquency rates have risen, so has the average number of extensions
granted. 

43 

Non-Accrual Receivables 

It
is not uncommon for our obligors to fall behind in their payments. However, with the diligent efforts of our Servicing staff and systems
for managing our collection efforts, we regularly work with our customers to resolve delinquencies. Our staff are trained to employ a
counseling approach to assist our customers with their cash flow management skills and help them to prioritize their payment obligations
in order to avoid losing their vehicle to repossession. Through our experience, we have learned that once a customer becomes greater than
90 days past due, it is not likely that the delinquency will be resolved and will ultimately result in a charge-off. As a result, we do
not recognize any interest income for contracts that are greater than 90 days past due. 

If
a contract exceeds the 90 days past due threshold at the end of one period, and then makes the necessary payments such that it becomes
less than or equal to 90 days delinquent at the end of a subsequent period, it would be restored to full accrual status for our financial
reporting purposes. At the time a contract is restored to full accrual in this manner, there can be no assurance that full repayment of
interest and principal will ultimately be made. However, we monitor each obligor s payment performance and are aware of the severity
of his delinquency at any time. The fact that the delinquency has been reduced below the 90-day threshold is a positive indicator. Should
the contract again exceed the 90-day delinquency level at the end of any reporting period, it would again be reflected as a non-accrual
account. 

Our
policy for placing a contract on non-accrual status is independent of our policy to grant an extension. In practice, it would be an uncommon
circumstance where an extension was granted and the account remained in a non-accrual status, since the goal of the extension is to bring
the contract current (or nearly current). 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our
business requires substantial cash to support our purchases of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources
of cash have been cash flows from the proceeds from term securitization transactions and other sales of automobile contracts, amounts
borrowed under various revolving credit facilities (also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities), customer payments of principal
and interest on finance receivables, fees for origination of automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitization transactions
and their related spread accounts. Our primary uses of cash have been the purchases of automobile contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed
under lines of credit, securitization transactions and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancy expenses and
other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, the increase
of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated
cash will be sufficient to meet our cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized
pools (which determines the level of releases from those pools and their related spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction
in our managed portfolio, and the terms upon which we are able to acquire and borrow against automobile contracts. 

Net cash provided by operating
activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 165.8 million, a decrease of 16.2 million, compared to net cash provided
by operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 of 181.9 million. Net cash from operating activities is generally
provided by net income from operations adjusted for significant non-cash items such as our provision for credit losses and marks to finance
receivables measured at fair value. 

Net cash used in investing activities
was 536.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 275.8 million in the prior year period. Net cash used in
investing activities generally relates to new purchases of automobile contracts net of principal payments and other proceeds received
during the period. Purchases of finance receivables excluding acquisition fees were 1,195.9 million and 958.6 million during the first
nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

44 

Net cash provided by financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 524.7 million compared to 73.1 million in the prior year period. Cash provided
by financing activities is primarily related to the issuance of securitization trust debt, reduced by the amount of repayment of securitization
trust debt and net proceeds or repayments on our warehouse lines of credit and other debt. In the first nine months of 2024, we issued
 1,453.9 million in new securitization trust debt compared to 949.4 million for the same period in 2023. We repaid 840.5 million in
securitization trust debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to repayments of securitization trust debt of 814.5 million
in the prior year period. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net repayments on warehouse lines of credit of 125.6 million,
compared to net advances from warehouse lines of credit of 46.4 million in the prior year s period. 

We purchase automobile contracts
from dealers for a cash price approximately equal to their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase
or decrease the automobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over a period of years. We
have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts and our securitization transactions for long term
financing of our contracts. In addition, we have accessed other sources, such as residual financings and subordinated debt in order to
finance our continuing operations. 

The acquisition of automobile
contracts for subsequent financing in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization,
if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount
of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement
in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accounts either release cash to
us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. Of those, the factor most subject to our control is the rate
at which we purchase automobile contracts. 

We are and may in the future
be limited in our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted
cash of 8.1 million and 294.2 million aggregate available borrowings under our two warehouse credit facilities (assuming the availability
of sufficient eligible collateral). As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 20.9 million of such eligible collateral. Our plans
to manage our liquidity include maintaining our rate of automobile contract purchases at a level that matches our available capital, and,
as appropriate, minimizing our operating costs. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we completed four securitizations
aggregating 1,453.9 million of notes sold. 

Our liquidity will also be
affected by releases of cash from the trusts established with our securitizations. While the specific terms and mechanics of each spread
account vary among transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cash flows, if any, only
if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and the net losses related to the automobile contracts in the pool are
below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies or net losses on the automobile contracts exceed such levels, the terms
of the securitization may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool. There can be no assurance that
collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash. 

Our warehouse credit facilities
contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum
levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain of our debt agreements other than our
term securitizations contain cross-default provisions. Such cross-default provisions would allow the respective creditors to declare a
default if an event of default occurred with respect to other indebtedness of ours, but only if such other event of default were to be
accompanied by acceleration of such other indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. 

45 

We have and will continue to
have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 3,105.0 million of debt outstanding. Such debt
consisted primarily of 2,875.8 million of securitization trust debt and 105.8 million of debt from warehouse lines of credit. Our securitization
trust debt has increased by 610.3 million while our warehouse lines of credit debt has decreased by 128.2 million since December 31,
2023 (each net of deferred financing costs). Since 2005, we have offered renewable subordinated notes to the public on a continuous basis,
and such notes have maturities that range from six months to 10 years. We had 24.3 million and 17.2 million in subordinated renewable
notes outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. On June 30, 2021, we completed a 50.0 million securitization
of residual interests from other previously issued securitizations. On March 2024, we completed a new residual interest financing of our
residual interests from previously issued securitizations in the amount of 50.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, all 100.0 million
of this debt remains outstanding. 

Although we believe we are
able to service and repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operations do not generate
sufficient cash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. If we fail to pay our indebtedness
when due, it could have a material adverse effect on us and may require us to issue additional debt or equity securities. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

We maintain a system of internal controls and
procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of our published financial statements and other disclosures
included in this report. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of such disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer (Charles E. Bradley, Jr.) and
the principal financial officer (Denesh Bharwani) concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing,
summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, material information relating to us that is required to be included in our reports filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most
recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

The information provided under the caption Legal
Proceedings, Note 8 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I of this report, is incorporated
herein by reference. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

We remind the reader that risk factors are set
forth in Item 1A of our report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2024. Where we are aware
of material changes to such risk factors as previously disclosed, we set forth below an updated discussion of such risks. The reader should
note that the other risks identified in our report on Form 10-K remain applicable. 

We have substantial indebtedness. 

We have and will continue to
have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 3,105.0 million of debt outstanding. Such debt
consisted primarily of 2,875.8 million of securitization trust debt and 105.8 million of debt from warehouse lines of credit. Our securitization
trust debt has increased by 610.3 million while our warehouse lines of credit debt has decreased by 128.2 million since December 31,
2023 (each net of deferred financing costs). Since 2005, we have offered renewable subordinated notes to the public on a continuous basis,
and such notes have maturities that range from six months to 10 years. We had 24.3 million and 17.2 million in subordinated renewable
notes outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. On June 30, 2021, we completed a 50.0 million securitization
of residual interests from other previously issued securitizations. On March 2024, we completed a new residual interest financing of our
residual interests from previously issued securitizations in the amount of 50.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, all 100.0 million
of this debt remains outstanding. 

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect
our financial condition by, among other things: 

increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 

requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness,
thereby reducing amounts available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; 

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in
which we operate; 

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and 

limiting our ability to borrow additional funds. 

Although we believe we are able to service and
repay such debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not generate sufficient operating profits, our ability
to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. Failure to pay our indebtedness when due could have a material adverse effect. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we repurchased 70,000 shares from existing shareholders, as reflected in the table below.
