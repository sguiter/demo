The tax benefit for the periods presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets arising from the net operating losses and other temporary differences, the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not. In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts to be more likely than not. A valuation allowance will be maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of any portion or all of the valuation allowance.

Revenue 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company s revenue was 180,028. This was paid by a single customer, Beijing Cabelongteng Investment Center, for whom the Company
developed an enterprise software package. 

Operating expenses 

Operating expenses consisted primarily of fees
paid to employees and an audit fee. 

Net loss 

Our net loss fell from 32,527 in the the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 to 15,581 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The reasons for the modest loss in 2024 are set
forth above. In the first half of 2023 we incurred a larger net loss because we had no revenue. 

Taxation 

Our company, our subsidiaries, and our consolidated VIE file tax returns separately. 

2 

1) 
 Value added tax VAT 

Pursuant to the Provisional Regulation of the PRC on VAT and the related implementing rules, all entities and individuals taxpayers that are engaged in the modern service industry in the PRC are generally required to pay VAT at a rate of 6 of the gross sales proceeds received, less any deductible VAT already paid or borne by the taxpayers. Our PRC subsidiary and our consolidated VIE are subject to VAT at 6 of their revenues. 

2) 
 Income tax 

Cayman Islands 

The Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on the Company based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation. In addition, payments of dividends that we make to our shareholders are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands. 

Hong Kong 

Kesheng HK, which was incorporated in Hong Kong, is subject to a corporate income tax rate of 16.5 . 

PRC 

Our subsidiary and the consolidated VIE established in the PRC are subject to the PRC statutory income tax rate of 25 , according to the PRC Enterprise Income Tax EIT law. 

The current PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law imposes a 10 withholding income tax for dividends distributed by foreign invested enterprises to their immediate holding companies outside the PRC. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between the PRC and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. Distributions to holding companies in Hong Kong that satisfy certain requirements specified by PRC tax authorities, for example, will be subject to a 5 withholding tax rate. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

To date we have realized revenue from one sale
only: an enterprise software package that we sold in the first quarter of 2024 to a single customer. We will not be able to generate significant
additional sales until we obtain sufficient working capital to enable us to market our services broadly. At September 30, 2024 we had
a working capital deficit of 550,813), as we had only 88,980 in current assets and had current expenses including accrued payables
totaling 249,149 and a 388,173 debt to related parties. The debt of 388,173 is owed to our CEO; we do not expect her to require payment
in the near term. 

Our principal asset is a loan receivable of 310,682.
The loan does not mature until the end of March, 2026. Therefore, in order to fund our growth, we will have to secure capital investment.
At present, however, we have no commitments from any investor to provide funds for our operations. 

During the first nine months of 2024 we used 110,728
in operations. The primary reason for this use was that the funds obtained by closing the sale of our enterprise software had been credited
to cash flow when received in the 4 th quarter of 2023. Our operations during the first nine months of 2024, therefore, were
funded by a loan of 91,038 from our CEO. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the material information required to be disclosed by us in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management team, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures have the following material weaknesses: 

The relatively small number of employees who are responsible for accounting functions prevents us from segregating duties within our internal control system. 

Our internal financial staff lack expertise in identifying and addressing complex accounting issues under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 

Our Chief Financial Officer is not familiar with the accounting and reporting requirements of a U.S. public company. 

We have not developed sufficient documentation concerning our existing financial processes, risk assessment and internal controls. 

Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s system of disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 for the purposes described in this paragraph. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting came to management s attention during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

4 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, expenses and investment income. Our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions. 

In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no accounting estimate we made that were subject to a high degree of uncertainty and was critical to our results.
