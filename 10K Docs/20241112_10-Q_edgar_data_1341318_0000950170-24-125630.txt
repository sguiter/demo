Real estate loans of approximately million and million in unpaid principal balance were pledged as collateral for Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLBNY") advances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total loans are stated at the principal amounts outstanding, net of unamortized loan fees and costs, with interest income accrued based upon the outstanding principal balance and the terms of the loans. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the related loan yield using the interest method. Loans are reported by the portfolio segments identified above and are analyzed by management on this basis. All loan policies identified below apply to all segments of the loan portfolio. Accrued interest on loans of million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is included in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheet and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans The loan portfolio is segmented into the following loan types by risk level: Real Estate Loans: One- to Four-Family are loans secured by first lien collateral on residential real estate primarily held in the Western New York region. These loans can be affected by economic conditions and the value of underlying properties. Western New York s housing market has consistently demonstrated stability in home prices despite changing economic conditions. Furthermore, the Company has conservative underwriting standards and its residential lending policies and procedures verify that its one- to four-family residential mortgage loans generally conform to secondary market guidelines. 

 Home Equity - are loans or lines of credit secured by first or second liens on owner-occupied residential real estate primarily held in the Western New York region. These loans can also be affected by economic conditions and the values of underlying properties. Home equity loans may have increased risk of loss if the Company does not hold the first mortgage resulting in the Company being in a secondary position in the event of collateral liquidation. The Company does not originate interest only home equity loans. 

 Commercial Real Estate are loans used to finance the purchase of real property, which generally consists of developed real estate that is held as first lien collateral for the loan. These loans are secured by real estate properties that are primarily held in the Western New York region. Commercial real estate lending involves additional risks 

10 

. Whenever possible, we collateralize these loans with a lien on business assets and equipment and require the personal guarantees from principals of the borrower. Commercial loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk, as commercial loans can involve relatively large loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers, with the repayment of such loans typically dependent on the successful operation of the commercial business and the income stream of the borrower. Such risks can be significantly affected by economic conditions. Although commercial loans may be collateralized by equipment or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default may be an insufficient source of repayment because the equipment or other business assets may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial loan depends primarily on the credit worthiness of the borrowers (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is a secondary and often insufficient source of repayment. 

 Consumer consist of loans secured by collateral such as an automobile or a deposit account, unsecured loans and lines of credit. Consumer loans tend to have a higher credit risk due to the loans being either unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciable assets. Furthermore, consumer loan payments are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. 

 Included in the Real Estate Loans for one-to four-family and commercial real estate are loans to finance the construction of either a one- to four-family owner occupied home or commercial real estate. At the end of the construction period, the loan automatically converts to either a one- to four-family residential mortgage or a commercial real estate mortgage, as applicable. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion compared to the actual cost of construction. The Company limits its risk during construction as disbursements are not made until the required work for each advance has been completed and an updated lien search is performed. The completion of the construction progress is verified by a Company loan officer or inspections performed by an independent appraisal firm or other third party. Construction loans also expose us to the risk of construction delays which may impair the borrower s ability to repay the loan.

There was interest income recognized on non-accrual loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due. A loan does not have to be 90 days delinquent in order to be classified as non-accrual. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. If ultimate collection of principal is in doubt, all cash receipts on non-accrual loans are applied to reduce the principal balance.

Collateral-Dependent Loans Collateral-dependent loans are loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. These loans do not share common risk characteristics and are not included within the collectively evaluated loans for determining the allowance for credit losses. Under CECL, for collateral-dependent loans, the Company has adopted the practical expedient to measure the allowance for credit losses based on the fair value of collateral. The allowance for credit losses is measured on an individual loan basis based on the difference between the fair value of the loan s collateral, which is adjusted for liquidation costs, and the amortized cost. If the fair value of the collateral exceeds the amortized cost, no allowance for credit losses is required. Refer to Note 8 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments for additional information. The following table presents an analysis of the amortized cost of collateral-dependent loans of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by collateral type and loan segment:

There was allowance for credit losses recorded on the above noted collateral-dependent loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Credit Quality Indicators The Company s policies provide for the classification of loans as follows: Pass/Performing; 

 Special Mention does not currently expose the Company to a sufficient degree of risk but does possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving the Company s close attention; 

 Substandard has one or more well-defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. A substandard asset would be one inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or pledged collateral, if applicable; 

 Doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in substandard loans with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss; and 

 Loss loan is considered uncollectible and continuance without the establishment of a specific valuation reserve is not warranted. 

 Each commercial loan is individually assigned a loan classification. The Company s consumer loans, including residential one- to four-family loans and home equity loans, are classified by using the delinquency status as the basis for classifying these loans. Generally, all consumer loans more than 90 days past due are classified and placed in non-accrual. Such loans that are well-secured and in the process of collection will remain in accrual status.

Modifications with Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty : Occasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing modifications to loans that it would not normally grant. Such modifications could include principal forgiveness, term extension, a significant payment delay, an interest rate reduction or the addition of a co-borrower or guarantor. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of the forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. In some cases, the Company provides multiple types of modifications on one loan. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another modification may be granted, such as principal forgiveness. There were loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

t record an allowance for credit losses for its collateral-dependent loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Foreclosed Real Estate and Repossessed Assets. Foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets are held at the lower of cost or fair value and are considered to be measured at fair value when recorded below cost. The fair value of foreclosed real estate is calculated using independent appraisals, less estimated selling costs. Certain repossessed assets may require assumptions about factors that are not observable in an active market when determining fair value. Accordingly, foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. There was foreclosed real estate at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023 , which was included as a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company did t have repossessed assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Mortgage Servicing Rights . Mortgage servicing rights do not trade in an active market with readily observable market data. As a result, the Company estimates the fair value of loan servicing rights by using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The key assumptions used in the model include the estimated life of loans sold with servicing retained and the estimated cost to service the loans. Loan servicing rights are classified as Level 3 measurements due to the use of unobservable inputs, as well as management judgment and estimation. Mortgage servicing rights amounted to and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and were included as a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

Overview 
 The following discussion and analysis is presented to assist in the understanding and evaluation of our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and other relevant statistical data. It is intended to complement the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction therewith. The detailed discussion focuses on our consolidated financial condition as of September 30, 2024 compared to the consolidated financial condition as of December 31, 2023 and the consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on loans and investments and the interest expense we pay on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earn or pay on these balances. 
 Our operations are also affected by non-interest income, such as service charges and fees, debit card fees, earnings on bank owned life insurance, our provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses which include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, data processing, professional services, advertising, FDIC insurance and other general and administrative expenses. 
 Financial institutions like us, in general, are significantly affected by economic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for and supply of housing and commercial real estate, competition among lenders, interest rate conditions, and funds availability. Our operations and lending are principally concentrated in the Western New York area, and our operations and earnings are influenced by local economic conditions. Deposit balances and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates on competing investments, customer preferences, and levels of personal income and savings in our primary market area. Operations are also significantly impacted by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact the Company.

 As previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 25, 2024 with the SEC, the Company received written approval from the Reserve Bank to pay a cash dividend of 0.18 per share to its stockholders. In addition, the Reserve Bank also issued a non-objection to the MHC to waive the MHC s receipt of cash dividends on its common stock up to 0.72 per share during the twelve-month period ending April 2, 2025 (the Dividend Waivers ). As the Company has previously disclosed, the MHC received the approval of its members (depositors of Lake Shore Savings Bank) for the Dividend Waivers on April 2, 2024. On April 25, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.18 per share on its outstanding common stock. The dividend was paid on May 10, 2024 to stockholders of record as of May 6, 2024. The MHC elected to waive receipt of the dividend on its shares. 
 
 As previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 28, 2023 with the SEC, the MHC and the Company (collectively, the Companies ), the parent savings and loan holding companies of the Bank, entered into a written agreement (the Agreement with the Reserve Bank, the Companies regulator. The Agreement provides, among other things, that the Companies take appropriate steps to fully utilize the Companies financial and managerial resources to serve 
 31 

as a source of strength to the Bank, including, but not limited to, taking steps to ensure that the Bank complies with the Consent Order (described below) and not, directly or indirectly, declare or pay dividends, increase or guarantee any debt without the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. We expect that our non-interest expenses will continue at their increased levels as a result of the Agreement and the Order, which may adversely affect our financial performance. 
 
 As previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 9, 2023 with the SEC, the Bank consented to the issuance of a Consent Order (the Order by the OCC, the Bank s primary federal regulator. The Order requires the Bank to correct deficiencies related to information technology, security, automated clearing house program, audit, management and BSA/AML. Management and the Bank s Board of Directors are committed to promptly addressing the action items included in the Order. We expect that our non-interest expenses will continue at their increased levels as a result of remediation actions we will take in order to comply with the requirements of the Order which may adversely affect our financial performance. 
 
 Management Strategy 
 There have been no material changes in the Company s management strategy from what was disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. As a result, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available at that time. Critical accounting estimates includes the areas where the Company has made what it considers to be particularly difficult, subjective, or complex judgments concerning estimates, and where these estimates can significantly affect the Company's financial results under different assumptions and conditions. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could be different from these estimates. The Company evaluates its critical accounting estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and updates them as needed. Significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included within Part II. Item 8. of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part I. Item 1. of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 Management considers the allowance for credit losses to be a critical accounting estimate, given the uncertainty in estimating lifetime credit losses attributable to its portfolios of assets exhibiting credit risk, particularly in its loan portfolio, and the material effect that such judgments can have on the Company's results of operations. Determining the amount requires significant judgment on the part of management, is multi-faceted, and can be imprecise. The level of the allowance for credit losses on loans is based on management s ongoing review of all relevant information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and expectations of the future based on reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
 
 The allowance is established through a provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is performed by management on a quarterly basis. While management uses available information to anticipate credit losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions or the composition of its portfolios. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company's allowance for credit losses. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses on loans totaled 5.5 million and 6.5 million, respectively. Due to the nature and composition of the Bank's lending activities, a significant portion of the allowance for credit losses on loans is allocated to the commercial real estate portfolio. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses on loans allocated to the total commercial real estate portfolio was 4.4 million and 5.2 million respectively, or 80.9 for both periods. 
 
 32 

The Company's methodology for maintaining its allowance for credit losses on is based on historical experience and data, current economic information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Accordingly, the estimation of the allowance for credit losses is impacted by the economic forecasts utilized, which require the use of significant judgment. Deterioration to forecasted economic conditions may lead to further required increases to the allowance for credit losses. Conversely, improvements to forecasted economic conditions may warrant further reductions to the allowance for credit losses. In estimating the allowance for credit losses, management considers the sensitivity of the model and significant judgments and assumptions that could result in an amount that is materially different from management s estimate. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses is sensitive to various forecasted macroeconomic drivers, including the Federal Open Market Committee's ("FOMC") median forecasted U.S. civilian unemployment rate and the year-over-year change in U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP"). While it is difficult to estimate how potential changes to various factors may impact the allowance for credit losses because such changes to factors may not occur at the same rate or in the same direction, management compared the modeled allowance for credit losses on loans to a hypothetical model using a downside economic forecast. Using an immediate "shock" or increase of 20 basis points in the FOMC's projected rate of U.S. civilian unemployment, and a decrease of 100 basis points in the FOMC's projected rate of U.S. GDP growth, this would increase the model's total calculated allowance for credit losses on loans by 497,000, or 9.0 , representing a nine basis points increase to the coverage ratio of the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of net loans, assuming all other quantitative and qualitative factors are kept at current levels, as of September 30, 2024. This example is only one of the numerous possible economic scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses and does not represent management s assumptions or judgment of factors as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Unexpected changes in economic growth could adversely affect our results of operations, including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates on loans, which would adversely impact our charge-offs, allowance for credit losses, and provision for credit losses. Deterioration in real estate values, employment data and household incomes may also result in higher credit losses for us. Also, in the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry, counterparty, borrower or issuer. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our business, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities and industries, may not function as we have anticipated. 
 
 Analysis of Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income represents the difference between the interest we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as commercial and residential mortgage loans and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income depends on both the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earn or pay on them. 
 
 Average Balances, Interest and Average Yields. The following tables set forth certain information relating to our average balance sheets and reflects the average yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, interest earned and interest paid for the periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances over the periods indicated. The average balances for loans are net of allowance for credit losses but include non-accrual loans. The loan yields include net amortization of certain deferred fees and costs that are considered adjustments to yields. The net amortization of deferred loan fees and costs were 103,000 and 77,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net amortization of deferred loan fees and costs 
 33 

were 369,000 and 392,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest income on securities does not include a tax equivalent adjustment for tax exempt securities.

Rate Volume Analysis . The following tables analyze the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The tables show the amount of the change in interest income or expense caused by either changes in outstanding balances (volume) or changes in interest rates. The effect of a change in volume is measured by applying the average rate during the later period to the volume change between 
 35 

the two periods. The effect of changes in rate is measured by applying the change in rate between the two periods to the average volume during the first period.

As shown in the above tables, the decrease in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily impacted by an increase in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase in the average yield earned on interest-earning assets when compared to the prior year period. The average interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 86 basis points from 1.86 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.72 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 140 basis points increase in the average interest rate paid on money market accounts and a 110 basis points increase in the average interest rate paid on time deposits as compared to the prior year period. The increase in average interest rate paid on money market accounts and time deposits was primarily due to an increase in customer demand for these types of deposit products due to the elevated and competitive interest rate environment. The average yield on interest-earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 21 basis points when compared to the prior year period primarily due to an increase in the average interest rate earned on the loan portfolio from 5.45 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.70 during the three 
 36 

months ended September 30, 2024. Net interest margin decreased to 3.28 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.74 for the same period of the prior year. 
 
 As shown in the above tables, the decrease in net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily impacted by an increase in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase in the average yield earned on interest-earning assets when compared to the prior year period. The average interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 109 basis points from 1.61 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.70 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 163 basis points increase in the average interest rate paid on money markets accounts and a 144 basis points increase in the average interest rate paid on time deposit accounts in comparison to the prior year period. The increase in average interest rate paid on money market accounts and time deposits was primarily due to an increase in customer demand for these types of deposit products due to the elevated and competitive interest rate environment. The average yield on interest-earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 32 basis points when compared to the prior year period primarily due to an increase in the average interest rate earned on the loan portfolio from 5.25 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.58 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net interest margin decreased to 3.17 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.72 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 
 Total assets at September 30, 2024 were 697.6 million, a decrease of 27.5 million, or 3.8 , from 725.1 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in total assets was primarily due to a 16.8 million, or 3.0 , decrease in loans receivable, net, a 3.9 million, or 30.8 , decrease in other assets related to bank-owned life insurance, a 3.7 million, or 7.0 , decrease in cash and cash equivalents, and a 1.7 million, or 2.7 , decrease in securities available-for-sale. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased by 3.7 million, or 7.0 , from 53.7 million at December 31, 2023 to 50.0 million at September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of 25.0 million of Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLBNY") borrowings and the nonrenewal of 16.0 million of brokered Certificates of Deposits ("CDs"), partially offset by organic deposit growth of 12.6 million, or 2.2 , and a decrease in net loans of 16.8 million, or 3.0 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Securities decreased by 1.7 million, or 2.7 , from 60.4 million at December 31, 2023 to 58.8 million at September 30, 2024, primarily due to securities paydowns of 2.4 million, partially offset by a 822,000 decrease in the gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we remained strategically focused on originating shorter duration, adjustable-rate loans to diversify our asset mix and to manage interest rate risk.

When compared to December 31, 2023, the current modeled allowance for credit losses related to the loan portfolio decreased by approximately 1.0 million, or 15.0 , of which a majority of the decrease was attributable to the commercial mortgage loan portfolio 788,000). Of the total decrease in the allowance for credit losses on loans from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, 767,000 was due to a decrease in reserve rate, while 202,000 was due to a decrease in the size of the loan portfolio. The decrease in the ACL reserve rate was primarily due to the decrease in the quantitative loss factors derived from historical loss rates calculated in the vintage model as well as a decrease in the qualitative loss factor derived from forecasting economic trends which includes the FOMC's projected rate of U.S. civilian unemployment and U.S. year-over-year growth of GDP.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consumer loan net charge-offs to average consumer loans outstanding, annualized, improved to 2.81 from 4.58 for the prior year period. This improvement was primarily driven by a decrease in consumer loan net charge-offs of 18,000, partially offset by a decrease in average consumer loans outstanding of 121,000.

 Total non-performing assets increased by 628,000, or 18.6 , to 4.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 3.4 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in non-accrual loans, including one home equity loan totaling 539,000 which was moved to non-accrual status during the first quarter of 2024. The Company had no loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 Other assets decreased 3.9 million, or 30.8 , to 8.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 12.8 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to the 6.6 million of proceeds received from the surrender of bank-owned life insurance which was in process at the end of 2023.

 39 

The decrease in total deposits was due to decreases in brokered CDs and interest-bearing checking and savings accounts, offset by increases in money market accounts, customer time deposits and non-interest bearing checking accounts. The change in deposit mix was driven by customer demand due to the competitive interest rate environment. The decrease in total time deposits was comprised of a 16.0 million decrease in brokered CDs and a 13.2 million increase in customer time deposits. The decrease in brokered CDs was a result of the Company s strategic focus, which is centered on organic growth of deposits among its retail and commercial customers to reduce the reliance on wholesale funding and to strengthen customer relationships. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s percentage of uninsured deposits to total deposits was 13.4 and 12.8 , respectively. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, long-term borrowings decreased by 25.0 million to 10.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 35.3 million at December 31, 2023 in connection with the repayment of 25.0 million of long-term debt with FHLBNY. 
 
 Stockholders equity at September 30, 2024 was 89.9 million, a 3.6 million increase, or 4.2 , as compared to 86.3 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in stockholders equity was primarily attributed to 3.5 million in net income earned during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 General. Net income was 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, or 0.24 per diluted share, a decrease of 239,000, or 15.2 , compared to net income of 1.6 million, or 0.27 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflected a 912,000 decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a 383,000 decrease in non-interest expense, a 186,000 increase in non-interest income, and a 30,000 change in the (credit) provision for credit losses. 
 
 Interest Income. Interest income increased by 130,000, or 1.5 , to 8.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to an increase in interest earned on interest-earning deposits and an increase in loan interest income. Interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold interest income increased 157,000, or 28.1 , to 716,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to an 11.2 million, or 25.7 increase in the average balance of interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold and an increase of nine basis points in the average yield of interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold to 5.25 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Loan interest income increased by 31,000, or 0.4 , to 7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period primarily due to a 25 basis points increase in the average yield on loans, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of the loan portfolio of 22.4 million, or 4.0 , from 565.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 542.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average yield on loans, including fees was 5.70 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.45 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on loans with a rate reset feature and new loan originations at higher rates. The decrease in the average balance of the loan portfolio was primarily driven by a decrease in the average balance of commercial real estate and residential loans due to payoffs. 
 
 Investment securities interest income decreased 58,000, or 12.5 , to 405,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 5.5 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities and a 13 basis points decrease in the average yield of investment securities due to securities sales and paydowns. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 1.0 million, or 43.0 , to 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest paid on deposits. Interest accrued on deposits increased by 1.2 million, or 57.7 , to 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to a 97 basis points increase in the average interest rate paid on deposit accounts to 2.71 as the deposit mix shifted towards higher-cost time deposits and money market accounts. The average balance of deposits increased by 5.5 million, or 1.1 , from 483.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 489.3 
 40 

million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in the average balance of time deposits and money market accounts. Interest expense on borrowed funds and other interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 173,000, or 53.7 , to 149,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 16.5 million decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds and other interest-bearing liabilities, and a 58 basis points decrease in the average rate paid on borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in borrowings was a result of management s strategy to reduce reliance on wholesale funding and focus on organic growth of deposits among its retail and commercial customers. 
 
 (Credit) Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses represents a charge or credit made to earnings to maintain a sufficient allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is management s estimate of expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is measured using the vintage method. The allowance for credit losses also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures, including loan commitments and standby letters of credit, as well as available-for-sale debt securities. Management considers past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts as the basis for the estimation of excepted credit losses. 
 
 The Company recorded a 229,000 credit to the provision for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a credit of 199,000 to the provision for credit losses during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The current period (credit) provision for credit losses was primarily due to a decrease in the qualitative loss factor derived from the forecasting factor, which includes the FOMC's projected rate of U.S. civilian unemployment and U.S. year-over-year growth of GDP. 
 Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased by 186,000, or 30.7 , to 791,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 605,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 173,000 increase in earnings on bank-owned life insurance in connection with the restructuring of bank-owned life insurance during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the recognition of a death benefit in the third quarter of 2024, as well as an increase in service charges and fees of 28,000, or 10.9 . 
 
 Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense was 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 383,000, or 7.4 , as compared to 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease from the prior year quarter was primarily related to a decrease in FDIC insurance expense of 165,000, or 55.9 , and a decrease in advertising expense of 146,000, or 93.0 , as a result of a decrease in marketing spending. As a result of management's efforts to rationalize staffing and optimize operating expenses, salaries and employee benefits decreased by 31,000, or 1.1 . 
 Income Taxes Expense. Income tax expense was 258,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 74,000, or 22.3 , as compared to 332,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in the effective tax rate related to the restructuring of bank-owned life insurance along with a decrease in income before income tax. The effective tax rate was 16.2 and 17.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 General. Net income was 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or 0.62 per diluted share, a decrease of 609,000, or 15.0 , compared to net income of 4.1 million, or 0.69 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected a 3.1 million decrease in net interest income and a 145,000 decrease in the (credit) provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 1.9 million decrease in non-interest expense and a 524,000 increase in non-interest income. 
 
 Interest Income. Interest income increased by 1.1 million, or 4.3 , to 26.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to an increase in interest earned on interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold and an increase in loan interest income. Interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold interest income increased 748,000, or 61.6 , to 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to a 16.2 million, or 47.3 increase in the average balance of interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold and an increase of 46 basis points in the average 
 41 

yield of interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold to 5.19 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Loan interest income increased by 584,000, or 2.6 , to 23.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period primarily due to a 33 basis point increase in the average yield on loans, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of the loan portfolio of 20.1 million, or 3.5 , from 570.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 549.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average yield on loans, including fees was 5.58 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.25 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on loans with a rate reset feature and new loan originations at higher rates. The decrease in the average balance of the loan portfolio was driven by a decrease in the average balance of all loan categories due to payoffs outpacing new loan originations and line of credit utilization. 
 
 Investment securities interest income decreased 259,000, or 17.2 , to 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 10.2 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities and a nine basis points decrease in the average yield of investment securities due to securities sales and paydowns. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 4.2 million, or 65.4 , to 10.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest paid on deposits. Interest accrued on deposits increased by 4.6 million, or 86.3 , to 9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense on deposits to 2.68 was primarily due to a 122 basis points increase in the average interest rate paid on deposit accounts as the deposit mix shifted towards higher-cost time deposits and money market accounts. The average balance of deposits increased by 6.3 million, or 1.3 , from 487.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 493.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in the average balance of time deposits and money market accounts. Interest expense on borrowed funds and other interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 452,000, or 44.8 , to 558,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 14.4 million decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds and other interest-bearing liabilities, and a 45 basis points decrease in the average rate paid on borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in borrowings was a result of management s strategy to reduce reliance on wholesale funding and focus on organic growth of deposits among its retail and commercial customers. 
 
 (Credit) Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses represents a charge or credit made to earnings to maintain a sufficient allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is management s estimate of expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is measured using the vintage method. The allowance for credit losses also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures, including loan commitments and standby letters of credit, as well as available-for-sale debt securities. Management considers past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts as the basis for the estimation of excepted credit losses. 
 
 The Company recorded a 866,000 credit to the provision for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a credit of 1.0 million to the provision for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The current period (credit) provision for credit losses was primarily due to a decrease in the quantitative loss factors derived from historical loss rates calculated in the vintage model as well as a decrease in the qualitative loss factor derived from forecasting economic trends, which includes the FOMC's projected rate of U.S. civilian unemployment and U.S. year-over-year growth of GDP. The prior period (credit) provision for credit losses was primarily due to a decrease in the qualitative loss factor derived from forecasting economic trends, which includes the FOMC's projected rate of U.S. civilian unemployment and U.S. year-over-year growth of GDP, and a decrease in the loan portfolio and loan commitments during the first nine months of 2023. 
 Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased by 524,000, or 30.6 , to 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 394,000 increase in earnings on bank-owned life insurance in connection with the restructuring of bank-owned life insurance during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the recognition of a death benefit in the third quarter of 2024, a favorable variance of 58,000 related to interest rate swaps during the first nine months of 2024 as a result of unwinding the swaps 
 42 

during 2023, and a 52,000 increase related to the loss on the sale of securities available for sale that occurred during the first nine months of 2023 as part of a balance sheet restructuring. 
 
 Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense was 14.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.9 million, or 11.5 , as compared to 16.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease related primarily to a decline in professional services expense of 1.0 million, or 48.0 , as a result of a decrease in the use of external consultants. Additionally, advertising costs decreased by 435,000, or 84.6 , due to a decrease in marketing spending, and FDIC insurance costs decreased by 133,000, or 16.1 . As a result of management's efforts to rationalize staffing and optimize operating expenses, salaries and employee benefits decreased by 208,000, or 2.5 and occupancy and equipment expenses decreased by 148,000, or 6.7 . These decreases were partially offset by an increase in data processing costs of 51,000, or 4.0 . 
 Income Taxes Expense. Income tax expense was 657,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 181,000, or 21.6 , as compared to 838,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in the effective tax rate related to the restructuring of bank-owned life insurance along with a decrease in income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 16.0 and 17.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise during the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to fund loan commitments, to pay the deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers as well as to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposits, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loans and securities, maturities and sales of investments and loans, excess cash, interest earning deposits at other financial institutions, and funds provided from operations. We have written agreements with the FHLBNY, which allows us to borrow the maximum lending values designated by the type of collateral pledged. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum amount that we can borrow from the FHLBNY, based on the market value of certain fixed-rate residential, one- to four-family loans pledged to FHLBNY, was 35.3 million, which was collateralized by certain fixed-rate residential, one- to four-family loans in delivery. We can increase our maximum borrowing capacity by providing additional collateral in delivery. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding advances under this agreement of 10.3 million. We have a written agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank discount window for overnight borrowings which is collateralized by a pledge of our securities and allows us to borrow up to the value of the securities pledged. As of September 30, 2024, we had no securities pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank and we had no balances outstanding. We have also established an unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank for 20.0 million. There were no borrowings on this line as of September 30, 2024. 
 As a result of the Order previously disclosed herein, the Company s ability to access available sources of funds from the FHLB has been curtailed to short-term advances (i.e., 30 days or less) and the residential loans pledged as collateral for these borrowings are subject to reductions in value. The availability of lines of credit with one other correspondent bank was terminated, while the availability of lines of credit with other correspondent banks may also be reduced or eliminated. Lastly, during the most recent quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank communicated that the Bank may now qualify for uncollateralized intraday credit for its Master Account. If approved for uncollateralized intraday credit, certain transactions will not be rejected for which there are insufficient funds in the Bank's Federal Reserve Master Account. 
 While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit outflows, calls of investment securities, and prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions, and competition in the marketplace. These factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds. 
 Our primary investing activities include the origination of loans and the purchase of investment securities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we originated loans of approximately 42.8 million as compared to approximately 47.6 million of loans originated during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Loan principal repayments and other reductions exceeded originations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 17.3 million. The Company did not make any purchases of investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the nine months 
 43 

ended September 30, 2023. The Company did not sell any investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and sold investment securities amounting to 8.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 As described elsewhere in this report, the Company has loan commitments to borrowers and borrowers have unused overdraft lines of protection, unused home equity lines of credit and unused commercial lines of credit that may require funding at a future date. The Company believes it has sufficient funds to fulfill these commitments, including sources of funds available through the use of FHLBNY advances or other liquidity sources. Total deposits were 587.6 million at September 30, 2024, as compared to 590.9 million at December 31, 2023. Approximately 193.8 million of time deposit accounts are scheduled to mature within one year as of September 30, 2024. Based on our deposit retention experience, and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us following their maturity. 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position; therefore, we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. The marginal cost of new funding, however, whether from deposits or borrowings from the FHLBNY, will be carefully considered as we monitor our liquidity needs. Therefore, in order to manage our cost of funds, we may consider additional borrowings from the FHLBNY in the future. 
 We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures in 2024. We do not have any balloon or other payments due on any long-term obligations, other than the borrowing agreements noted above. 
 Regulatory Capital 
 
 Federal regulations require a federal savings bank to meet certain capital standards, as discussed in the Supervision and Regulation section included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 The federal banking agencies have developed a Community Bank Leverage Ratio (bank s tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than 10 billion and limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities. A qualifying community bank may elect to utilize the Community Bank Leverage Ratio in lieu of the general applicable risk-based capital requirements under Basel III. If the community bank exceeds this ratio it will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered well capitalized under Basel III. The federal banking agencies may consider a financial institution s risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the capital ratio requirement. The federal banking agencies set the minimum capital for the Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 9.0 . The Bank elected to be subject to this new definition when it became effective on January 1, 2020, and has continued to use the Community Bank Leverage Ratio since that time. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank s Community Bank Leverage Ratio was 13.37 and 12.68 , respectively. 
 Pursuant to an Individual Minimum Capital Requirement, the Bank has been directed by the OCC to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage capital ratio of 10 and a Total Risk-Based capital ratio of 13 . In order to be considered well-capitalized by the OCC, a savings bank must maintain a Tier 1 Leverage capital ratio of 5 and a Total Risk-Based capital ratio of 10 . At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank s Tier 1 Leverage capital ratio was 13.37 and 12.68 , respectively and its Total Risk-Based capital ratio was 18.85 and 17.77 , respectively, and accordingly the Bank was in compliance with its Individual Minimum Capital Requirement and was considered well-capitalized. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Other than loan commitments, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors. Refer to Note 6 in the Notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for a summary of loan commitments outstanding as of September 30, 2024.
