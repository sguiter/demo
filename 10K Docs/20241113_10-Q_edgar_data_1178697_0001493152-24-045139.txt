statements provided by that act as well as protections afforded by other federal securities laws. Generally, words such as achieve, 
 aim, ambitions, anticipate, believe, committed, continue, 
 could, designed, estimate, expect, forecast, future, 
 goals, grow, guidance, intend, likely, may, milestone, 
 objective, on track, opportunity, outlook, pending, plan, 
 position, possible, potential, predict, progress, roadmap, 
 seek, should, strive, targets, to be, upcoming, will, 
 would, and variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which are not historical
in nature. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this Quarterly Report and other documents we file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including without limitation, the following sections: 

(i) 
 Note
 8 Commitments and Contingencies to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the possible outcome of,

 of funding, and future products, services, and technologies; and 

(iii) 
 Part
 I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures, including the description of limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures. 

Forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking
statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: 

the
 availability of cash on hand and other sources of liquidity to fund our operations and grow our business; 

our
 ability to compete effectively depends on multiple factors and we may not be able to continue to develop solutions to address user
 needs effectively; 

we
 may not be able to continue to develop solutions to address user needs effectively, including our next-generation products, which
 could materially adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to continue operations; 

a
 small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue; 

our
 entry into the data device sector could divert our management team s attention from existing products, cause delays in launching
 our new products, or otherwise have a significant adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition; 

failure
 to meet the Nasdaq s continued listing requirements and other Nasdaq rules could adversely affect the price of our common stock
 and make it more difficult for us to sell securities in a future financing or for you to sell our common stock; 

the
 financial and operational projections that we may provide from time to time are subject to inherent risks; 

our
 ability to incorporate emerging technologies into our new consumer products given the lengthy development cycle; 

our
 ability to adapt to shortened customer lead times and tightened inventory controls from our key customers; 

we
 are materially dependent on some customer relationships that are characterized by product award letters and the loss of such relationships
 could harm our business and operating results; 

our
 quarterly results may vary significantly from period to period; 

we
 rely primarily on third-party contract manufacturers and partners; 

if
 our products contain defects or errors, we could incur significant unexpected expenses, experience product returns and lost sales,
 experience product recalls, suffer damage to our brand and reputation, and be subject to product liability or other claims; 

we
 are required to undergo a lengthy customization and certification process for each wireless carrier customer; 

we
 are dependent on the continued services and performance of a concentrated and limited group of senior management and other key personnel; 

we
 face risks related to the impact of various economic, political, environmental, social, and market events beyond our control that
 can impact our business and results of operations; and 

other
 risks and uncertainties described in this Quarterly Report, our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our other filings with
 the SEC. 

We
urge investors to consider all of the risks, uncertainties, and other factors disclosed in these filings carefully in evaluating the
forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. We cannot assure you that the results or developments anticipated by us
and reflected or implied by any forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report will be realized or, even if substantially
realized, that those results or developments will result in the forecasted or expected consequences for us or affect us, our operations
or financial performance as we forecasted or expected. As a result of the matters discussed above and other matters, including changes
in facts, assumptions not being realized, or other factors, the actual results relating to the subject matter of any forward-looking
statement in this Quarterly Report may differ materially from the anticipated results expressed or implied in that forward-looking statement.
The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report are made only as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and we undertake
no obligation to update any such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 (In
Thousands, except Share and Per Share Amounts) 

, and is headquartered in San Diego, California. The Company
specializes in rugged and durable mobile devices, catering to users who require extra resilience in their professional and personal lives.
Initially focusing on handsets and accessories for the enterprise, first responder, and government sectors, Sonim has broadened its offerings
to include connected devices for wireless internet access such as mobile hotspots. 

In
2023, the Company announced an expanded portfolio which includes next-generation ultra-rugged 5G feature phones, a next-generation rugged
smartphone, and a connected solutions portfolio of wireless internet solutions, including wireless modems, mobile hotspots and fixed
wireless access routers. Sonim launched a mobile hotspot at the end of the second quarter of 2024 in the United States and Canada, and
as of the date of this report, has launched other versions of the mobile hotspots, one with Verizon in the U.S. and one with Telstra
in Australia, and two new models of rugged phones in Europe. 

A
significant revenue driver in 2023 was a tablet developed under Sonim s original design manufacturer ODM model,
emphasizing high-volume and low-margin production tailored to a specific customer s needs. Tablet sales concluded in the fourth
quarter of 2023 due to its life cycle end, the ODM model was also applied late in the fourth quarter of 2023 for a range of low-priced
smartphones with sales ending in the first quarter of 2024. The ODM model does not represent the Company s core business strategy. 

of its issued and outstanding common stock (the Reverse Stock
Split ). The Company s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on a post-split basis on July 18, 2024. As
a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to July 17, 2024, was automatically
converted into one-tenth (1/10) of a share of common stock. The Reverse Stock Split affected all common stockholders uniformly and did
not alter any stockholder s percentage interest in the Company s equity, except to the extent that the Reverse Stock Split
would result in a stockholder owning a fractional share. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.
Stockholders who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share instead were entitled to receive one whole share in lieu of
such fractional share. 

The
Reverse Stock Split did not change the par value of the common stock or the authorized number of shares of common stock. All outstanding
stock options, restricted stock units, and warrants entitling their holders to purchase or obtain or convert into shares of our common
stock were adjusted, as required by the terms of these securities. 

The
Company s stockholders equity, in the aggregate, remained unchanged following the Reverse Stock Split. Net income (loss)
per share increased because there were fewer shares of common stock outstanding. There were no other accounting consequences, including
changes to the amount of stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in any period, that arose as a result of the Reverse Stock
Split. 

All
common share and per-share amounts in this Form 10-Q have been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split. 

of the face value of the receivables being sold by the Company, up to a maximum of of
eligible customer invoices from the Company. In consideration of the advances, LS is entitled to receive 

The
Receivables Financing Agreement has an initial term of twelve (12) months, subject to automatic annual extension unless terminated.
Additionally, under certain circumstances and unless waived by LS, the Company will be obligated to pay a missing notation fee of 
in the event of its failure to affix a certain legend regarding assignment or a misdirected payment fee in the amount of .
In the event of the Company s default, the Company s payment obligations will be accelerated, and, in addition to the
aforementioned fees payable to LS, the Company will be required to pay the default interest rate of the lesser of 
per annum or the maximum rate permitted by law until the default is cured or until all Company s obligations are paid in
full. 

The
Company s obligations under the Receivables Financing Agreement are secured by a lien on all of the Company s accounts receivable,
inventory, and related property, excluding accounts receivable from certain specified counterparties. 

The
Receivables Financing Agreement contains representations and warranties by the Company and LS, certain indemnification provisions in
favor of LS and customary covenants (including limitations on other debt, liens, acquisitions, investments and dividends), and events
of default (including payment defaults, breaches of covenants, a material impairment in LS s security interest or in the collateral,
and events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency). The Receivables Financing Agreement can be terminated by either party upon written
notice or by LS upon the occurrence of certain events including the Company s default. As of September 30, 2024, there were no
borrowings outstanding under the Receivables Financing Agreement. 

. The Company believes that
it can meet its obligations with this cash over the next twelve months following the filing date of this report.

Arrangement, the Company consummated various transactions during the first quarter of 2024. The Company did not have any sales under
the ODM Arrangement during the three months ended June 30, 2024, or September 30, 2024.

Shipping
and handling costs 

The
Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise
to transfer the associated products. 

Contract
costs 

Applying
the practical expedient, the Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred when the amortization
period of the assets that otherwise would have been recognized is one year or less. These costs are included in sales and marketing expenses. 

The
non-recurring costs associated with design and development of new products for technical approval represent costs to fulfill a contract
pursuant to ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs. Accordingly, the Company capitalizes these contract fulfillment costs
and amortizes such costs over the estimated period of time they are expected to be recovered, which is typically three to ,
the estimated life of a particular product model. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the net contract fulfillment assets
were and , respectively. 

If
the Company determines that such contract fulfillment costs are not expected to be recovered, it records an impairment in the period
such determination is made. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment of contract fulfillment
assets of due to a decrease in projected profit of one of its hotspots and the cancellation of a consumer durable product. 

The
methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future
fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants,
the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different
fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Allowance for credit losses

The
Company determines the probability of default for each pool of receivables with similar risk characteristics. The probability of loss

stopped sales of the white label tablets to its tablet customer as the product reached the end of its life cycle. The tablet
customer had a receivable due to the Company of at December 31, 2023. In February 2024, an agreement was executed that transferred

On
August 6, 2024, the Company entered into a sales agreement (the Sales Agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC Roth ).
Pursuant to the Sales Agreement, the Company may sell, at its option, shares of common stock through Roth, as sales agent. Sales of shares

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company recorded provisions for income taxes of and , respectively.
The Company s effective income tax rate is negative for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily
as a result of projected permanent items in the U.S. 

The
Company s material income tax jurisdictions are the United States (federal and California), China and India. As a result of net
operating loss and credit carryforwards, the Company is subject to audit for tax years 2012 and forward for federal and California purposes.
The China and India tax years are open under the statute of limitations from 2013 and forward. 

The
Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations of its tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various
jurisdictions. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company regularly assesses the
likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. These assessments
can require considerable estimates and judgments. As of September 30, 2024, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately
 million. If the Company s estimates of income tax liabilities prove to be less than the ultimate assessment, then a further
charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal
of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
The Company does not anticipate any material changes to its uncertain tax positions during the next twelve months.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with Cautionary Note About Forward-Looking Statements and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included under
Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as amended,
including Part 1, Item 1A Risk Factors. 

Company
Overview 

Sonim
Technologies, based in the United States, is a leading provider of enterprise 5G solutions, offering a robust portfolio that includes
rugged handsets, smartphones, wireless internet devices, software, services, and accessories. These products are engineered for reliable
communication in challenging and unpredictable environments, serving sectors such as critical communications, first responders, government,
industrial, construction, hospitality, and logistics. We currently have products available at all three U.S. Tier-one carriers 
AT T, T-Mobile and Verizon as well as the three primary carriers in Canada Bell, Telus and Rogers, and Telstra in Australia.
These carriers then resell our products, along with network services, to end customers focusing on two primary end markets: industrial
enterprise and public sector. 

In
2023, Sonim announced a strategic expansion initiative, focusing on broadening its market reach with new products, geographical markets,
and customer segments including enterprise, small and medium business, and prosumers. This strategy is underpinned by a strong emphasis
on execution. We have introduced new product categories: Connected Solutions featuring wireless internet products, a next-generation
rugged smartphone, and a new range of mid and low-tier professional rugged phones, all boasting IP68, MIL-STD-810H standards, and elements
of Sonim s Rugged Performance Standards (RPS), highlighting our value proposition to target markets. 

As
of the filing of this 10-Q, our recent product launches in Q3 and Q4 include the Sonim H500 series of mobile hotspots available through
UScellular, Bell, and Verizon in the U.S. and Canada; the Sonim H700 mobile hotspot with Telstra in Australia; and the XP100 professional
rugged phone in Europe available via distribution partners. Additionally, the XP10 is now available in EMEA and Australia, all supported
by the comprehensive SonimWare platform and enterprise services. 

Geographic
market expansion continues with agreements and product availability through new distribution partners in Europe and South Africa, catering
to carrier, reseller, and enterprise sales channels. New partners include TCCM, Brodos, Modino, Ingram Micro, and Cernotech, which bolster
our presence in these regions. This strategic alignment supports our commitment to offering reliable solutions and expanding our customer
base.

During
the first half of 2024, the Company was in a transition period, phasing out low margin white label products and commencing selling new
products through our carrier channels. Our strategy of moving away from the white label business was accelerated when our manufacturing
partners had difficulty maintaining production of our white label products. Revenue in the third quarter of 2024 decreased compared to
the third quarter of 2023 due to this transition away from white label products. However, with the launch of new products in the fourth
quarter of 2024 and in the first half of 2025, we anticipate significant revenue growth and improved profitability. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net revenues were primarily generated from sales of our mobile phones and industrial-grade
accessories, predominantly to wireless carriers in the United States and Canada. During the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023, white label tablets revenue comprised a significant portion of our revenue. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no
white label products were sold. The white label products sold in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 had lower margins compared to Sonim s
other offerings. 

With
the primary sales channels in the U.S. and Canada consisting of large wireless carriers, the Company s customer base is highly
concentrated. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, wireless carriers contributed 73 of our total net revenues, with our top
three carrier customers accounting for 59 of our total net revenues. Our rugged smartphones represented 46 of our total net revenues,
while feature phones were 34 of our total net revenues and white label phones (related party revenue) were 18 of our total net revenues.
For the three months ended September 30, 2024, wireless carriers contributed 82 of our total net revenues, with our top three carrier
customers accounting for 62 of our total net revenues. Our rugged smartphones represented 53 of our total net revenues, while feature
phones were 45 of our total net revenues. 

In
alignment with Sonim Technologies commitment to quality, reliability, and regulatory compliance, we have prioritized our Environmental,
Social, and Governance (ESG) and Trade Agreements Act (TAA) initiatives. TAA compliance is crucial in enhancing our market strategy,
particularly in expanding opportunities within government and enterprise markets, which demand stringent adherence to regulatory standards.
By ensuring our products meet TAA requirements, we reinforce our position as a trusted provider of enterprise 5G solutions. 

This
initiative underscores our dedication to delivering products that not only meet industry-leading standards but also comply with U.S.
federal procurement regulations, thereby enhancing our competitiveness in securing government contracts. 

Looking
ahead, Sonim is focused on bringing our new products and solutions offering to our expanded portfolio throughout 2025. 

Recent
Developments 

Recent
Product Awards 

The
first step in selling our products through wireless telecommunications carriers is to receive a product award from the carrier. The award
documents the intent of the carrier to carry the proposed product and offer it to customers through their stores or online. The carrier
and Sonim agree to a launch date that is generally nine months or longer from the date of the product award. After the product award,
the Company and its partners complete the design that includes the unique specifications from the carrier, test the device, obtain certification
from the carrier to sell the device, and begin full scale manufacturing of the product based on purchase orders issued by the carrier. 

As
of the filing date of this report, Sonim is completing the development, testing and certification of new products that it expects to
launch with various carriers in the fourth quarter of 2024 and in 2025. 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
July 17, 2024, the Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock (the Reverse Stock
Split ). Our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on a post-split basis on July 18, 2024. As a result of the
Reverse Stock Split, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to July 18, 2024, was automatically converted
into one-tenth (1/10) of a share of common stock. The Reverse Stock Split affected all common stockholders uniformly and did not alter
any stockholder s percentage interest in the Company s equity, except to the extent that the Reverse Stock Split would result
in a stockholder owning a fractional share. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders
who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share instead were entitled to receive one whole share in lieu of such fractional
share. 

17 

The
Reverse Stock Split did not change the par value of the common stock or the authorized number of shares of common stock. All outstanding
stock options, restricted stock units, and warrants entitling their holders to purchase or obtain or convert into shares of our common
stock were adjusted, as required by the terms of these securities. 

All
common share and per-share amounts in this Form 10-Q have been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split. 

Equity
Financing 

On
April 29, 2024, we consummated a private placement with a single investor and sold 350,000 shares of our common stock (as adjusted for
the Reverse Stock Split) and warrants to purchase up to 350,000 shares of our common stock for an exercise price of 11.00 per share
(as adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split) for an aggregate purchase price of 3.85 million. We used the net proceeds from the private
placement for working capital and general corporate purposes. The shares of our common stock sold in the private placement (including
those underlying the warrants) are subject to registration rights and may not be transferred or sold until 180 days after the closing,
or October 29 , 2024, subject to customary limited exceptions. 

ATM
Offering 

On
August 6, 2024, the Company entered into a sales agreement (the Sales Agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC Roth ).
Pursuant to the Sales Agreement, the Company may sell, at its option, up to an aggregate of 8.9 million in shares of common stock through
Roth, as sales agent. Sales of shares of our common stock made pursuant to the Sales Agreement are being made under the effective Registration
Statement on Form S-3. Roth is entitled to compensation at a commission rate of 3 of the gross sales price per share. For additional
information, refer to Note 5 Stockholders Equity to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this
report under the title ATM Offering. 

We
have no obligation to sell shares under the Sales Agreement, but we may do so from time to time. During the three months ended September
30, 2024, a total of 35,163 shares of common stock were sold under the Sales Agreement for net proceeds of 0.1 million after payment
of commission fees and other related expenses of 4,000. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 8.8 million of common
stock remaining available for sale under the ATM Sales Agreement. 

Receivables
Financing Agreement 

To
improve its liquidity during seasonally high working capital periods, on September 23, 2024, the Company entered into an invoice purchase
agreement (the Receivables Financing Agreement with LS DE LLC LS ), pursuant to which LS will provide receivables
factoring to the Company, pursuant to which LS will advance 80 of the face value of the receivables being sold by the Company, up to
a maximum of 2.5 million of eligible customer invoices from the Company. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any outstanding commitments
under the Receivables Financing Agreement. For additional information, refer to Note 1 The Company and Its Significant Accounting
Policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this report under the title Receivables Financing
Agreement. 

Impairment
of Contract Fulfillment Assets 

The
non-recurring costs associated with design and development of new products for technical approval represent costs to fulfill a contract
pursuant to ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs. Accordingly, the Company capitalizes these contract fulfillment costs
and amortizes such costs over the estimated period of time that the product will be sold, which is typically three to four years. As
of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the net contract fulfillment assets were 12,063 and 9,232, respectively. 

If
the Company determines that such contract fulfillment costs are not expected to be recovered, it records an impairment in the period
such determination is made. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment of contract fulfillment
assets of 3,217 due to a decrease in projected profit of one of its hotspots and the cancellation of a consumer durable product. This
product was cancelled because higher than anticipated manufacturing costs eliminated the expected profit margin on the product. 

Compliance
with Nasdaq Listing Rules 

On
September 14, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff of The Nasdaq
Stock Market, LLC Nasdaq notifying it that, because the bid price for its common stock had fallen below 1.00 per share
for 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer complied with the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Rule for continued listing. On August 2, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Staff
notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule.

Results
of Operations 

The
results of operations for the third quarter of 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full
year or in any future period. Historically, we have experienced higher revenues following the release of new products and their sales
with additional carriers and distributors. Additionally, we are actively expanding our Connected Solutions business, and the future demand
of our Connected Solutions customers has not been reflected in our historical financial statements.

Total
Net Revenues 

Total
net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 12.5 million compared to 2023 because 2023 included 13.9 million
in revenue from the white label tablets and the tablet sales ended in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company had planned to exit the
white label business in 2024 but our strategy of moving away from the white label business was accelerated when our manufacturing partners
had difficulty maintaining production of our white label products. The 2024 year has been a transition period, marked by the ending of
our white label business and the start of the launches of our hotspots and new rugged smartphone. Revenue is expected to increase in
2025 as we launch new products. 

Total
net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 36.9 million compared to 2023 because 2023 had 43.9 million
in white label tablet revenue, which was partially offset by 7.7 million in white label phone related party revenue in the first quarter
of 2024. The Company s 2024 strategy of moving away from the white label business was accelerated when our manufacturing partners
had difficulty maintaining production of our white label products. Revenue is expected to increase
in 2025 as new products are launched with additional carriers and distributors. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 11.2 million as compared to 2023 primarily due to the decrease
in net revenues. Cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenue decreased because 2024 did not have any lower margin white label products. 

Cost
of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 32.8 million as compared to 2023 primarily due to the decrease
in net revenues. Cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenue decreased because white label revenue decreased from 43.9 million in
2023 to 7.7 million in 2024, and white label products have much lower margins. 

Gross
Profit and Margin 

Gross
profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 1.4 million, while the gross margin percentage increased by 6 , compared
to 2023. The increase in gross profit percentage was because there was no white label revenue with its lower margins in 2024. 

Gross
profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 4.1 million, while the gross margin percentage increased by 8 , compared
to 2023. The increase in gross profit was because 2023 had more low margin white label revenue.

Research
and Development 

Research
and development R D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were flat compared to 2023. 

R D
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 0.9 million compared to 2023, primarily due to there being limited
R D projects during the first half of 2023. In 2024 R D expenses were primarily related to our new hotspots and rugged phones. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 0.9 million compared to 2023 primarily due to an
increase in marketing spend to support new products in 2024, as well as an increase in headcount primarily to support sales in Europe. 

Sales
and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 3.0 million compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase
in marketing spend to support new products in 2024 and to capture new business opportunities across Europe as a result of the ceased
operations of a competitor, as well as an increase in headcount primarily to support sales in Europe. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 0.8 million compared to 2023 primarily due to
an increase in the accrual for employee bonuses of 0.5 million and higher legal expenses of 0.3 million. 

General
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 2.1 million compared to 2023 primarily due to
an increase in personnel and consulting expenses, including stock-based compensation, an increase in public company filing
activity that required additional legal costs and auditor fees, and an increase in the accrual for employee bonuses. 

Impairment
of Contract Fulfillment Assets 

Impairment
of contract fulfillment assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 3.2 million, resulting from the Company s determination
that it would not recover the contract fulfillment costs capitalized due to a decrease in projected profit for one of its hotspots and
the cancellation of the consumer durable product. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Historically,
we have funded operations from a combination of public and private equity financings, convertible loans from existing investors and borrowings
under loan agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any convertible loans or any other borrowing structures in place. 

Currently,
our principal source of liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents totaling 9.1 million, as of September 30, 2024. On April 29,
2024, we received 3.8 million in cash, net of issuance costs, from an investor for the purchase of the Company s shares and the
issuance of warrants. Additionally, we may elect to sell shares of common stock under our at the market offering program,
as described in detail under the title ATM Offering . We also have access to up to 2.5 million available under the
Receivables Financing Agreement. We plan to continue to leverage multiple sources of liquidity to maintain flexibility in regard to meeting
our capital needs. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net loss was 12.0 million and our use of cash in operations was 4.0 million. Our cash
balance is expected to cover the negative cash flow from operating losses and from developing new products over the next year. Increased
revenue from new products is expected to improve cash flow over the next year. We expect to meet all obligations with existing cash and
operating cash flow for a period of at least one year from the date of release of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

20 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization
of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, were
 9.1 million.

Cash
flows from operating activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 4.0 million, primarily attributable to a net loss of
 12.0 million and net cash used in a change in net operating assets and liabilities of 0.3 million, partially offset by non-cash charges
of 8.3 million. The change in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable, net, due
to the timing of payments and an increase in accrued liabilities, partially offset
by an increase in inventory (primarily due to raw materials inventory), non-trade receivables (primarily purchasing raw materials for
our ODMs), related party receivables, and contract fulfillment assets (capitalized costs for product certifications). Non-cash charges
primarily consist of 3.2 million in impairment charges related to contract fulfillment assets, 2.6 million in depreciation and amortization,
 1.2 million for stock-based compensation, and 1.0 million in inventory write-downs. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 3.7 million, primarily attributable to net cash used
in a change in net operating assets and liabilities of 7.5 million, which was partially offset by net non-cash charges of 2.4 million
and net income of 1.3 million. The change in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable
(due to our tablet customer and a large carrier customer) and an increase in contract fulfillment assets (capitalized costs for product
certifications), partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. Non-cash charges primarily consist of 1.2 million in depreciation
and amortization, and 1.0 million for stock-based compensation. 

Cash
flows from investing activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, there were no significant investing activities. 

Cash
flows from financing activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received 3.8 million in cash, net of issuance costs, from an investor for the
purchase of shares and the issuance of warrants, as well as ATM sales. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was 0.3 million, primarily due to 0.4 million in proceeds
from the exercise of employee stock options, partially offset by the repayment of debt. 

Material
Cash Requirements 

There
have been no material changes to our material cash requirements from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain accounting
policies and estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require
the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic
factors or conditions that are outside of our control. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying
these policies, our management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain
estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, the terms
of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from
other outside sources, as appropriate. 

A
description of our critical accounting policies that represent the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements was provided in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no changes to our critical
accounting policies and estimates described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, that have had a material
impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. 

Segment
Information 

We
have one business activity and operate in one reportable segment. 

JOBS
Act 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). Under the
JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the
JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We elected to use this extended transition period for complying
with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the
date that we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period
provided in the JOBS Act. We expect to use the extended transition period for any other new or revised accounting standards during the
period in which we remain an emerging growth company. As a result, our condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable
to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) December 31, 2024 (the last day of the fiscal year following May 14,
2024, the fifth anniversary of the consummation of our initial public offering), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have
total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large
accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ),
which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700 million as of the last business day of
the second fiscal quarter of such year, or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities
during the prior three-year period. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a smaller
reporting company, which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not
being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and
reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our prospectuses and in our periodic reports and proxy statements. 

22 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this
item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, prior to filing
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officer concluded that,
as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any system of controls, however well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance, and not absolute assurance, that the desired control objectives of the system are
met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because
of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals in all future circumstances. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

For
information regarding our material legal proceedings, see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which information is incorporated herein
by reference. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

There
are no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2023, except as set forth below. 

The
risk factor titled Sales of our common stock under the currently effective registration statement or the perception of such
sales in the public market or otherwise could cause the market price for our common stock to decline, even if our business is doing well 
is amended and restated as follows: 

Sales
of our common stock under resale registration statements or the perception of such sales in the public market or otherwise could cause
the market price for our common stock to decline, even if our business is doing well. 

Resales
of our common stock may cause the market price of our securities to drop significantly. The sale of shares of our common stock in the
public market or otherwise, including sales pursuant to two effective Form S-3 Registration Statements and prospectuses, dated, respectively,
December 1, 2023, (the AJP Registration Statement and September 16, 2024 (the Liu Registration Statement or the perception that such sales could occur, could reduce the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock and increase the
volatility of our share price. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us: 

to
 sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate; and 

to
 comply with the Nasdaq listing standards with regard to the minimum bid price of our common stock. 

The
shares registered for resale through Liu Registration Statement (assuming the exercise of the entirety of the warrants) represent approximately
13 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of September 30, 2024, and approximately 27 of our public float as of such date.
The shares of common stock offered for resale pursuant to the AJP Registration Statement represent approximately 45 of the outstanding
shares of our common stock as of July 30, 2024, and approximately 84 of our public float as of such date. Until such time that these
registration statements are no longer effective, they will permit the resale of the registered shares. As such, sales of a substantial
number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. 

The
risk factor titled In prior years, we identified one material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which,
if not remediated, could have resulted in material misstatements in our financial statements is amended and restated as follows: 

We
have previously reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which have been remediated; however, we
may identify additional or new material weaknesses in the future that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result
in material misstatements in our financial statements or fail to prevent fraud. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls, and compliance
with the other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules promulgated by the SEC thereunder. A material weakness is a deficiency,
or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

In
prior years, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. While the material weaknesses related
to internal controls over financial reporting previously disclosed by Sonim have since been remediated, the process of designing and
implementing an effective financial reporting system is a continuous effort that requires our team to anticipate and react to changes
in Sonim s business, including its geographic expansion, to economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources
to maintain a financial reporting system that satisfies its reporting obligations. 

We
cannot be certain that the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls will be sufficient to ensure
that our internal controls will remain effective and eliminate the possibility that other material weaknesses or deficiencies may develop
or be identified in the future. If we identify future material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed,
investors may lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Implementing changes to our internal controls
in connection with the remediation of any material weakness may distract our management and could require us to incur significant expenses.
If we fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial
statements, our ability to report our financial results in a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital
markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities,
which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening
Sonim s internal controls and procedures, in the future those internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or
sufficiently identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements. 

The
risk factor titled We have failed, and may continue to fail, to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq, and as a result, our
common stock may become delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading, liquidity, and market price of our common
stock is amended and restated as follows: 

We
are required to meet the Nasdaq continued listing requirements and other Nasdaq rules, or we may risk delisting. Delisting could negatively
affect the price of our common stock, which could make it more difficult for us to sell securities in a future financing or for you to
sell our common stock. 

We
are required to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq and other Nasdaq rules, including those regarding director independence
and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders equity, minimum share price and certain other corporate governance
requirements. In particular, we are required to maintain a minimum bid price for our listed common stock of 1.00 per share, which we
previously failed to meet resulting in two reverse stock splits in a five-year period in order to regain compliance. If we do not meet
these continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted. Delisting from the Nasdaq would cause us to pursue eligibility
for trading of these securities on other markets or exchanges, or on the pink sheets. In such case, our stockholders 
ability to trade, or obtain quotations of the market value of our common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes
and transaction delays. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices of these securities.
There can be no assurance that our securities, if delisted from the Nasdaq in the future, would be listed on a national securities exchange,
a national quotation service, the over-the-counter markets or the pink sheets. Delisting from the Nasdaq, or even the issuance of a notice
of potential delisting (which notices have previously been issued), would also result in negative publicity, make it more difficult for
us to raise additional capital, cause us to lose eligibility to register the sale or resale of our shares on Form S-3 and the automatic
exemption from registration under state securities laws for exchange-listed securities, adversely affect the market liquidity of our
securities, decrease securities analysts coverage of us or diminish investor, supplier and employee confidence.
