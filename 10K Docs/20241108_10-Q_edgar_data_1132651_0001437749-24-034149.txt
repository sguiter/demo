Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment or a change in previously recognized impairment). The following table presents the assets carried on the balance sheet (after specific reserves) by caption and by level within the valuation hierarchy as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands) :

Evaluations of the underlying assets are completed for each collateral dependent loan with a specific reserve. The types of collateral vary widely and could include accounts receivables, inventory, a variety of equipment and real estate. Collateral evaluations are reviewed and discounted as appropriate based on knowledge of the specific type of collateral and could include cost approach, sales comparison approach, or income approach. In the case of real estate, an independent appraisal may be obtained. Types of discounts considered included aging of receivables, condition of the collateral, potential market for the collateral and estimated disposal costs. These discounts will vary from loan to loan. 

GAAP requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined under ASC 820 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The following table includes the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

The methodologies used to determine fair value as of September 30, 2024 did not change from the methodologies described in the December 31, 2023 Annual Financial Statements. 
 
 Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit : The fair values of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreement and credit worthiness of the counterparties. The carrying value and fair value of the commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are not considered significant. 
 
 Limitations : Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

Gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are summarized as follows (in thousands) :

Gross unrealized losses on debt securities totaled million as of September 30, 2024 . In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, state or political subdivision, or corporations. Management then determines whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and reviews industry analysts reports. The Company s procedures for evaluating investments in states, municipalities and political subdivisions include but are not limited to reviewing the offering statement and the most current available financial information, comparing yields to yields of bonds of similar credit quality, confirming capacity to repay, assessing operating and financial performance, evaluating the stability of tax revenues, considering debt profiles and local demographics, and for revenue bonds, assessing the source and strength of revenue structures for municipal authorities. These procedures, as applicable, are utilized for all municipal purchases and are utilized in whole or in part for monitoring the portfolio of municipal holdings. The Company does not utilize third party credit rating agencies as a primary component of determining if the municipal issuer has an adequate capacity to meet the financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the investment, and, therefore, does not compare internal assessments to those of the credit rating agencies. Credit rating downgrades are utilized as an additional indicator of credit weakness and as a reference point for historical default rates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company determined that no individual securities in an unrealized loss position represented credit losses that would require an allowance for credit losses. The Company concluded that the unrealized losses were primarily attributable to increases in market interest rates since these securities were purchased and other market conditions. Accrued interest receivable on AFS debt securities totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.

 Loans receivable, net 

1 This amount represents portfolio layer method basis adjustments related to loans hedged in a closed portfolio. Under the portfolio layer method basis adjustments are not allocated to individual loans, however, the amounts impact the net loan balance. These basis adjustments would be allocated to the amortized cost of specific loans within the pool if the hedge was de-designated. See Note 11 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information. 

Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at amortized cost net of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) and other basis adjustments. Amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding, net of deferred loan fees and costs. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. In the event that collection of principal becomes uncertain, the Company has policies in place to reverse accrued interest in a timely manner. Accrued interest receivable on loans held for investment totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Nonrefundable loan fees and origination costs are deferred and recognized as a yield adjustment over the life of the related loan. 
 
 The policy for charging off loans is consistent throughout all loan categories. A loan is charged off based on criteria that includes but is not limited to: delinquency status, financial condition of the entire customer credit line and underlying collateral coverage, economic or external conditions that might impact full repayment of the loan, legal issues, overdrafts, and the customer s willingness to work with the Company. 

Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans . The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the Company's existing loans held for investment portfolio. Expected credit loss inherent in non-cancelable off-balance-sheet OBS credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability on the balance sheet. The Company's allowance for credit losses for OBS credit exposures was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment, as reported in our consolidated balance sheet, is adjusted by a credit loss expense, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. 
 
 The credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of loan portfolio segments which consist of construction real estate, 1 to 4 family residential real estate, multi-family real estate, commercial real estate, agricultural real estate, commercial, agricultural and consumer and other lending. When computing allowance levels, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. The key components in this estimation process include the following: 
 
 An initial forecast period of one year for all portfolio segments and OBS credit exposures. This period reflects management's expectation of losses based on forward-looking economic scenarios over that time. 

A historical loss forecast period covering the remaining contractual life, adjusted for prepayments, by portfolio segment based on the change in key historical economic variables. 

A reversion period of 1 year connecting the initial loss forecast to the historical loss forecast based on economic conditions at the measurement date. 

The Company primarily utilizes loss rate based undiscounted cash flow (UDCF) methods to estimate credit losses by portfolio segment. The UDCF methods obtain estimated life-time credit losses using the conceptual components described above. 
 
 Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods. 
 
 Credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimation of expected credit losses. The following provides the credit quality indicators and risk elements that are most relevant and most carefully considered and monitored for each loan portfolio segment. 
 
 Construction loans are underwritten utilizing independent appraisals, sensitivity analysis of absorption, vacancy and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project. These estimates may prove to be inaccurate primarily due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the borrower or lender. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing. The Company may require guarantees on these loans. The Company s construction loans are secured primarily by properties located in its primary market area. National unemployment rate was a key economic forecast used in estimating expected credit losses for this segment as of December 31, 2023. National unemployment rate and national real gross domestic product (GDP) are key economic forecasts used in estimating expected credit losses for this segment as of September 30, 2024. 

The Company originates 1 - 4 family real estate loans utilizing credit reports to supplement the underwriting process. The Company s underwriting standards for 1 - 4 family loans are generally in accordance with FHLMC and FNMA manual underwriting guidelines. Properties securing 1 - 4 family real estate loans are appraised by either staff appraisers or fee appraisers, both of which are independent of the loan origination function and have been approved by the Board of Directors. The loan-to-value ratios normally do not exceed 90 without credit enhancements such as mortgage insurance. The Company will lend up to 100 of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price for conventional 1 - 4 family real estate loans, provided private mortgage insurance is obtained. The Company s 1 - 4 family real estate loans are secured primarily by properties located in its primary market area. The national unemployment rate is a key economic forecast used in estimating expected credit losses for this segment. 
 
 Multi-family, commercial and agricultural real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and agricultural operating loans, in addition to those unique to real estate loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and, secondarily, as loans secured by real estate. Multi-family, commercial and agricultural real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Loan-to-value generally does not exceed 80 of the cost or value of the assets. Loans are typically subject to interest rate adjustments between five and seven years from origination. Fully amortized monthly repayment terms normally do not exceed twenty-five years. Projections and cash flows that show ability to service debt within the amortization period are required. Property and casualty insurance is required to protect the Banks collateral interests. Appraisals on properties securing these loans are generally performed by fee appraisers approved by the Board of Directors. Because payments on multi-family, commercial and agricultural real estate loans are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. Management monitors and evaluates commercial and agricultural real estate loans based on collateral and risk rating criteria. The Company may require guarantees on these loans. The Company s multi-family, commercial and agricultural real estate loans are secured primarily by properties located in its primary market areas. The national unemployment rate and the national real GDP were key economic forecasts used in estimating expected credit losses for the multi-family and commercial real estate segments as of December 31, 2023. The national unemployment rate is a key economic forecast used in estimate credit losses for the multi-family and commercial real estate segments as of September 30, 2024. The national real GDP was a key economic forecast used in estimating expected credit losses for the agricultural real estate segment as of December 31, 2023. The national unemployment rate and national real GDP are key economic forecasts used in estimating expected credit losses for the agricultural real estate segment as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Commercial and agricultural operating loans are underwritten based on the Company s examination of current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. This underwriting includes the evaluation of cash flows of the borrower, underlying collateral, if applicable, and the borrower s ability to manage its business activities. The cash flows of borrowers and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value after the initial evaluation. A first priority lien on the general assets of the business normally secures these types of loans. Loan-to-value limits vary and are dependent upon the nature and type of the underlying collateral and the financial strength of the borrower. Crop and hail insurance is required for most agricultural borrowers. Loans are generally guaranteed by the principal(s). The Company s commercial and agricultural operating lending is primarily in its primary market area. The national unemployment rate and the national real GDP were key economic forecasts used in estimating expected credit losses for the commercial operating segment as of December 31, 2023. The national unemployment rate is a key economic forecast used in estimating expected credit losses for the commercial operating segment as of September 30, 2024. The national real GDP was a key economic forecast used in estimating expected credit losses for the agricultural operating segment as of December 31, 2023. The national unemployment rate and national real GDP are key economic forecasts used in estimating expected credit losses for the agricultural operating segment as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Consumer and other loans utilize credit reports to supplement the underwriting process. The underwriting standards include a determination of the applicant s payment history on other debts and an assessment of their ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. To monitor and manage loan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed by management. This activity, coupled with smaller loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes risk. Additionally, market conditions are reviewed by management on a regular basis. The Iowa real GDP and Iowa retail trade earnings were key economic forecasts used in estimating expected credit losses for this segment as of December 31, 2023. The national unemployment rate is a key economic forecast used in estimating expected credit losses for this segment as of September 30, 2024.

Nonaccrual Loans . The accrual of interest income on loans is discontinued when, in the opinion of management, there is reasonable doubt as to the borrower's ability to meet payments of interest or principal when they become due, which is generally when a loan is 90 days or more past due unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all previously accrued and unpaid interest is reversed against interest income. Loans are returned to an accrual status when all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected. A loan may also return to accrual status if additional collateral is received from the borrower and, in the opinion of management, the financial position of the borrower indicates that there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the collection of the amount contractually due. Payment received on nonaccrual loans are applied first to principal. Once principal is recovered, any remaining payments received are applied to interest income. 

The following table presents the amortized cost basis of loans on nonaccrual status and loans on nonaccrual status with no allowance for credit losses recorded by loan segment (in thousands) : 

Real estate - 1 to 4 family residential

The interest foregone on nonaccrual loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately thousand and thousand, respectively. The interest foregone on nonaccrual loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately thousand and thousand, respectively. 
 
 Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty . Loan modifications may include interest rate reductions or below market interest rates, extension of payments terms beyond the original maturity date, principal forgiveness, restructuring amortization schedules and other actions intended to minimize potential losses. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company uses a loss rate model to determine the allowance for credit losses. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. 
 
 The Company made no loan modifications and three loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 The following table shows the amortized cost basis at the end of the reporting period of the loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, disaggregated by segment of financing receivable and type of concession granted (in thousands) : 

The following table describes the financial effect of the modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 : 

Upon the Company s determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is charged-off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. The Company had no net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. 
 
 There were two loan modifications with an amortized cost basis of thousand that had a payment default and were modified in the twelve months before default as of September 30, 2024 . A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 60 days contractually past due under the modified terms.

Credit Quality Indicators . As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to (i) the risk ratings of loans, (ii) the level of classified loans, (iii) net charge-offs, (iv) non-performing loans and (v) the general economic conditions in our market areas. 
 
 The Company utilizes a risk rating matrix to assign risk ratings to each of its loans. Loans are rated on a scale of 1 to 7. A description of the general characteristics of the risk ratings is as follows: 
 
 Ratings 1, 2 and 3 - These ratings include Pass loans of average to excellent credit quality borrowers. These borrowers generally have significant capital strength, moderate leverage and stable earnings and growth commensurate to their relative risk rating. These ratings are reviewed at least annually. These ratings also include performing loans of less than 100,000. 
 
 Rating 4 - This rating includes loans on management s watch list and is intended to be utilized for pass rated borrowers where credit quality has begun to show signs of financial weakness that now requires management s heightened attention. This rating is reviewed at least quarterly. 
 
 Rating 5 - This rating is for Special Mention loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines. This rating is intended to be temporary and includes loans to borrowers whose credit quality has clearly deteriorated and are at risk of further decline unless active measures are taken to correct the situation. This rating is reviewed at least quarterly. 
 
 Rating 6 - This rating includes Substandard loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines, for which the accrual of interest has not been stopped. Under regulatory guideline definitions, a Substandard loan has defined weaknesses which make payment default or principal exposure likely, but not yet certain. Such loans are apt to be dependent upon collateral liquidation, a secondary source of repayment or an event outside of the normal course of business. This rating is reviewed at least quarterly. 
 
 Rating 7 - This rating includes Substandard-Impaired loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines, for which the accrual of interest has generally been stopped. This rating includes loans: (i) where interest is more than 90 days past due, (ii) not fully secured, (iii) where a specific valuation allowance may be necessary, or (iv) where the borrower is unable to make contractual principal and interest payments. This rating is reviewed at least quarterly.

The Company and the Banks are subject to the rules of the Basel III regulatory capital framework and related Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The rules included the implementation of a percent capital conservation buffer that is added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes for all capital ratios except tier 1 capital to average assets. A banking organization with a capital conservation buffer of less than the required amount is subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. At September 30, 2024 , the capital ratios for the Company and the Banks were sufficient to meet the conservation buffer. 

Item 2. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 
 
 Ames National Corporation (the Company is a bank holding company established in 1975 that owns and operates six bank subsidiaries in central, north-central and south-central Iowa (the Banks ). The following discussion is provided for the consolidated operations of the Company and its Banks, First National Bank, Ames, Iowa (First National), State Bank Trust Co. (State Bank), Boone Bank Trust Co. (Boone Bank), Reliance State Bank (Reliance Bank), United Bank Trust Co. (United Bank) and Iowa State Savings Bank (Iowa State Bank). The purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant factors affecting the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company does not engage in any material business activities apart from its ownership of the Banks. Products and services offered by the Banks are for commercial and consumer purposes including loans, deposits and wealth management services. Wealth management services includes financial planning and managing trust, agencies, estates and investment brokerage accounts. The Company employs twenty-three individuals to assist the Banks with its financial reporting, human resources, audit, compliance, marketing, technology systems, training, real estate valuation services and the coordination of management activities, in addition to 240 full-time equivalent individuals employed by the Banks. 
 
 The Company s primary competitive strategy is to utilize seasoned and competent Bank management and local decision making authority to provide customers with faster response times and more flexibility in the products and services offered. This strategy is viewed as providing an opportunity to increase revenues through creating a competitive advantage over other financial institutions. The Company also strives to remain operationally efficient to provide better profitability while enabling the Company to offer more competitive loan and deposit rates. 
 
 The principal sources of Company revenues and cash flow are: (i) interest and fees earned on loans made by the Company and Banks; (ii) interest on fixed income investments held by the Banks; (iii) fees on wealth management services provided by those Banks exercising trust powers; (iv) service fees on deposit accounts maintained at the Banks; (v) gain on sale of loans; and (vi) merchant and card fees. The Company s principal expenses are: (i) interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings; (ii) credit loss expense; (iii) salaries and employee benefits; (iv) data processing costs associated with maintaining the Banks loan and deposit functions; (v) occupancy expenses for maintaining the Banks facilities; and (vi) professional fees. The largest component contributing to the Company s net income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets (primarily loans and investments) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and other borrowings). One of management s principal functions is to manage the spread between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities in an effort to maximize net interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of interest rate risk. 
 
 The Company had net income of 2.2 million, or 0.25 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 2.9 million, or 0.33 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in earnings is primarily due to an increase in credit loss expense and consultant fees related to negotiating long-term vendor contracts. The increase in credit loss expense is primarily due to loan growth and a specific reserve placed on a commercial loan relationship. The consultant fees were paid as a percentage of the negotiated benefit to the Company. The consultant fees are recognized into expense during the contract negotiations while the benefits will be recognized throughout the related contractual agreements. 
 
 Net loan charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 10 thousand compared to net loan recoveries of 4 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. A credit loss expense of 371 thousand was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a credit loss benefit of 274 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Challenges, Risks and Uncertainties 
 
 Management has identified certain events or circumstances that may negatively impact the Company s financial condition and results of operations in the future and is attempting to position the Company to best respond to those challenges. These challenges are addressed in the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 8, 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The estimates and judgments that management believes involve the most complex and subjective estimates and judgments and have the most effect on the Company's reported financial position and results of operations are described as critical accounting policies in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024. There have been no significant changes in the critical accounting policies or the assumptions and judgments utilized in applying these policies since December 31, 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 This report contains references to financial measures that are not defined in GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures include the Company s presentation of net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are widely used in the financial institutions industry and provide useful information to both management and investors to analyze and evaluate the Company s financial performance. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be considered an alternative to the Company s GAAP results. The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income and net interest margin on an FTE basis to GAAP (dollars in thousands).

 Net Interest Income 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company's net interest margin adjusted for tax exempt income was 2.21 and 2.11 , respectively. Net interest income, prior to the adjustment for tax-exempt income, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 11.1 million compared to 10.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income increased 2.0 million, or 10.4 , when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher average rates and growth in the loan portfolio. 

40

Table of Contents 

Interest expense increased 1.6 million, or 19.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The higher interest expense for the period is primarily due to customers shifting to higher rate deposit products. 
 
 Credit Loss Expense 
 
 A credit loss expense of 371 thousand was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a credit loss benefit of 274 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net loan charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 10 thousand compared to net loan recoveries of 4 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The credit loss expense in 2024 was primarily due to an increase in specific reserves in the commercial loan portfolio. 
 
 Noninterest Income and Expense 
 
 Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 2.41 million compared to 2.36 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.2 . 
 
 Noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 10.5 million compared to 9.8 million recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 7.2 . The increase is primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits and 449 thousand of consultant fees for certain contract negotiations included in professional fees in 2024. These types of consultant fees are infrequent as they normally relate to longer term contracts and no additional fees are anticipated for contracts for the remainder of the year. The efficiency ratio was 77.87 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 75.12 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 397 thousand compared to 597 thousand recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 15 and 17 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The lower than expected tax rate in 2024 and 2023 was due primarily to tax-exempt interest income and New Markets Tax Credits.

 Net Interest Income 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company's net interest margin adjusted for tax exempt income was 2.16 and 2.21 , respectively. Net interest income, prior to the adjustment for tax-exempt income, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 32.9 million compared to 33.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income increased 6.9 million, or 12.7 , when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher average rates and growth in the loan portfolio. 

43

Table of Contents 

Interest expense increased 7.7 million, or 37.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The higher interest expense for the period is primarily due to an increase in market interest rates, customers shifting to higher rate deposit products and an increase in other borrowings. 
 
 Credit Loss Expense 
 
 A credit loss expense of 722 thousand was recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a credit loss expense of 34 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net loan charge-offs totaled 6 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net loan charge-offs of 177 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The credit loss expense in 2024 was primarily due to loan growth and an increase in specific reserves. The credit loss expense in 2023 was primarily due to charge-offs in the agriculture and commercial loan portfolios. 
 
 Noninterest Income and Expense 
 
 Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 7.2 million compared to 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.0 . The increase is primarily due to an increase in wealth management income and partially offset by losses on the sale of securities in 2024. 
 
 Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 31.4 million compared to 30.1 million recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.3 . The increase is primarily due to an increase in number of employees, normal increases in salaries and benefits and 799 thousand of consultant fees for certain contract negotiations included in professional fees. The efficiency ratio was 78.47 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 74.27 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 1.2 million compared to 1.7 million recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 15 and 17 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lower than expected tax rate in 2024 and 2023 was due primarily to tax-exempt interest income and New Markets Tax Credits.

Balance Sheet Review 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, total assets were 2.1 billion, a 32.3 million decrease compared to December 31, 2023. This decrease in assets is primarily due to a decrease in securities available-for-sale and partially offset by an increase in loans. 
 
 Investment Portfolio 
 
 The investment portfolio totaled 688.6 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 47.8 million from the December 31, 2023 balance of 736.4 million. The decrease in securities available-for-sale is primarily due to maturities in excess of purchases and partially offset by a decrease in unrealized losses. 
 
 On a quarterly basis, the investment portfolio is reviewed for credit losses. As of September 30, 2024, gross unrealized losses of 39.8 million, are due to the interest rate environment and are not considered credit-related. Certain bonds in the investment portfolio may incur credit losses and could negatively affect the Company s net income. As a result of the Company s favorable liquidity position, the Company does not have the intent to sell securities with an unrealized loss at the present time. In addition, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will hold these securities until recovery of their fair value to cost basis and expects full principal and interest to be collected. Therefore, the Company does not have an allowance for credit losses on these investments as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company s investment securities portfolio included securities issued by 261 government municipalities and agencies located within 30 states with a fair value of 256.4 million. At December 31, 2023, the Company s investment securities portfolio included securities issued by 272 government municipalities and agencies located within 30 states with a fair value of 269.9 million. No one municipality or agency represents a concentration within this segment of the investment portfolio. Omaha, Nebraska, sewer revenue bonds with a fair value of 5.4 million (approximately 2.1 of the fair value of the government municipalities and agencies) represent the largest exposure to any one municipality or agency for the Company as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company s procedures for evaluating investments in states, municipalities and political subdivisions include but are not limited to reviewing the offering statement and the most current available financial information, comparing yields to yields of bonds of similar credit quality, confirming capacity to repay, assessing operating and financial performance, evaluating the stability of tax revenues, considering debt profiles and local demographics, and for revenue bonds, assessing the source and strength of revenue structures for municipal authorities. These procedures, as applicable, are utilized for all municipal purchases and are utilized in whole or in part for monitoring the portfolio of municipal holdings. The Company does not utilize third party credit rating agencies as a primary component of determining if the municipal issuer has an adequate capacity to meet the financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the investment, and, therefore, does not compare internal assessments to those of the credit rating agencies. Credit rating downgrades are utilized as an additional indicator of credit weakness and as a reference point for historical default rates.

Loan Portfolio 
 
 The loan portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, totaled 1.296 billion and 1.278 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the 1 to 4 family residential real estate, multi-family real estate and agricultural operating loan portfolios. 
 
 Deposits 
 
 Deposits totaled 1.80 billion and 1.81 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to lower balances in retail and commercial noninterest-bearing checking, savings and money market accounts as customers seek higher interest rates. A portion of the decrease in retail and commercial noninterest-bearing checking, savings and money market accounts was offset by an increase in time deposits and public funds. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased to 42.8 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 54.0 million as of December 31, 2023. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and deposit balances fluctuate as customers liquidity needs vary and could be impacted by prevailing market interest rates, competition, and economic conditions. Approximately 15 of deposits are tied to external indexes as of September 30, 2024. Deposit interest expense related to these deposits can be more volatile than other deposit products in a changing interest rate environment. 
 
 Other Borrowings 
 
 Other borrowings decreased to 83.1 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 110.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company has reduced borrowings throughout 2024 as investments have matured. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. No material changes in the Company s off-balance sheet arrangements have occurred since December 31, 2023. 
 
 Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management 
 
 The Company s credit risk is historically centered in the loan portfolio, which totaled 1.296 billion and 1.278 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Net loans comprise 61 of total assets as of September 30, 2024. The objective in managing loan portfolio risk is to reduce the risk of loss resulting from a customer s failure to perform according to the terms of an agreement and to quantify and manage credit risk on a portfolio basis. The Company s level of problem loans (consisting of nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more) as a percentage of total loans was 1.33 at September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.08 at December 31, 2023. The Company s level of problem loans as a percentage of total loans at September 30, 2024 of 1.33 is higher as compared to the Iowa State Average peer group of FDIC insured institutions as of June 30, 2024, of 0.49 , most recent available. 
 
 Substandard-Impaired loans totaled 16.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and have increased 3.7 million as compared to the substandard-impaired loans of 13.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to downgrades in the commercial real estate and commercial operating loan portfolios. 

47

A loan is considered Substandard-Impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payment of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. The Company applies its normal loan review procedures to identify loans that should be evaluated for impairment. 
 
 Loans past due 90 days or more that are still accruing interest are reviewed no less frequently than quarterly to determine if there continues to be a strong reason that the credit should not be placed on nonaccrual. As of September 30, 2024, nonaccrual loans totaled 17.5 million and there were no loans past due 90 days and still accruing. This compares to nonaccrual loans of 13.8 million and 109 thousand of loans past due 90 days and still accruing as of December 31, 2023. There was no other real estate owned as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Loans past due 30 days or more totaled 9.8 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 4.3 million as of December 31, 20 23. The increase is primarily related to the commercial real estate portfolio. 
 
 The watch and special mention loans classified as agricultural real estate and operating totaled 27.5 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 19.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to agricultural operating loans that were moved to watch as the customers refinance and restructure assets. The substandard and substandard-impaired loans in these categories totaled 6.1 million and 6.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The watch and special mention loans classified as commercial real estate totaled 41.0 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 73.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The substandard and substandard-impaired commercial real estate loans totaled 29.3 million and 15.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The changes between periods are primarily due to weaking in the commercial real estate loan portfolio as some commercial real estate loans are experiencing a decline in occupancy rate and collateral valuation. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of outstanding loans as of September 30, 2024 was 1.34 , as compared to 1.30 at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses totaled 17.6 million and 16.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in the allowance for credit losses is mainly due to loan growth and an increase in specific reserves. 
 
 Due to recent trends in the banking industry, commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans are facing heightened risk due to factors such as increased susceptibility to economic pressures caused by elevated interest rates and challenging market conditions. The Company maintains a rigorous approach to risk management through regular loan reviews, stress testing and sensitivity analyses to evaluate the risk level in the loan portfolio. Loan reviews include monitoring past due rates, non-performing trends, concentrations, loan-to-value ratios, and other qualitative factors. The Company's loan policies are robust and are updated as needed to align with strategic objectives and risk management priorities. 
 
 Commercial real estate and multi-family real estate represent approximately 42 of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024. The following is an additional breakdown of the Company's commercial real estate and multi-family real estate portfolios (in thousands) :

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity management is the process by which the Company, through its Banks Asset and Liability Committees (ALCO), ensures that adequate liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. These commitments include funding credit obligations to borrowers, funding of mortgage originations pending delivery to the secondary market, withdrawals by depositors, maintaining adequate collateral for pledging for public funds, trust deposits and borrowings, paying dividends to shareholders, payment of operating expenses, funding capital expenditures and maintaining deposit reserve requirements. 
 
 Liquidity is derived primarily from core deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; principal and interest payments, sale, maturity and prepayment of securities available-for-sale; net cash provided from operations; and access to other funding sources. Other funding sources include federal funds purchased lines, Federal Reserve BTFP, FHLB advances and other capital market sources.

As of September 30, 2024, the level of liquidity and capital resources of the Company remain at a satisfactory level. Management believes that the Company s liquidity sources will be sufficient to support its existing operations for the foreseeable future. 
 
 The liquidity and capital resources discussion will cover the following topics: 

Review of the Company s Current Liquidity Sources 

Review of Statements of Cash Flows 

Company Only Cash Flows 

Review of Commitments for Capital Expenditures, Cash Flow Uncertainties and Known Trends in Liquidity and Cash Flows Needs 

Capital Resources 

Review of the Company s Current Liquidity Sources 
 
 Liquid assets of cash on hand, balances due from other banks and interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled 59.0 million and 55.1 million, respectively, and management believes these sources provide an adequate level of liquidity given current economic conditions. 
 
 Other sources of liquidity available to the Banks as of September 30, 2024 include outstanding lines of credit with the FHLB of Des Moines, Iowa of 201.0 million, with 72.5 million of outstanding FHLB advances. Federal funds borrowing capacity at correspondent banks was 97.5 million, with no outstanding federal fund purchase balances as of September 30, 2024. The Company had securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaling 42.8 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Total investments as of September 30, 2024 were 688.6 million compared to 736.4 million as of December 31, 2023. These investments provide the Company with liquidity since all of the investments are classified as available-for-sale as of September 30, 2024. The Company has 398.9 million of unpledged securities available-for-sale and interest-bearing deposits as of September 30, 2024. The investment portfolio serves an important role in the overall context of balance sheet management in terms of balancing capital utilization and liquidity. The decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate environment, liquidity and credit considerations. The portfolio s scheduled maturities and payments represent a significant source of liquidity. 
 
 Review of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 8.4 million compared to 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 4.4 million in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to payments of accrued interest on borrowings and lower net income. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 51.6 million compared to 38.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 12.8 million in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to maturities of securities available-for-sale. 
 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 56.1) million compared to 10.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities of 66.6 million was primarily due to payments on other borrowings, fewer proceeds from other borrowings between periods and a decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by a lower decrease in deposits. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any external debt financing, off-balance sheet financing arrangements, or derivative instruments linked to its stock.

Review of Company Only Cash Flows 
 
 The Company s liquidity on an unconsolidated basis is heavily dependent upon dividends paid to the Company by the Banks. The Banks provide adequate liquidity to pay the Company s expenses and stockholder dividends. Dividends paid by the Banks to the Company amounted to 7.9 million and 7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amounts of dividends banking subsidiaries are permitted to pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. Federal Reserve policy further limits the circumstances under which bank holding companies may declare dividends. For example, a bank holding company should not continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements, which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Federal and state banking regulators may also restrict the payment of dividends by order. 
 
 The Company, on an unconsolidated basis, has interest-bearing deposits totaling 1.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Review of Commitments for Capital Expenditures, Cash Flow Uncertainties and Known Trends in Liquidity and Cash Flows Needs 
 
 No other material capital expenditures or material changes in the capital resource mix are anticipated at this time. The primary cash flow uncertainty would be a sudden decline in deposits causing the Banks to liquidate securities. Historically, the Banks have maintained an adequate level of short-term marketable investments to fund the temporary declines in deposit balances. There are no known trends in liquidity and cash flow needs as of September 30, 2024 that are of concern to management. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 The Company s total stockholders equity as of September 30, 2024 totaled 183.4 million and was 17.6 million higher than the 165.8 million recorded as of December 31, 2023. The increase in stockholders equity was primarily the result of a decrease in unrealized losses on the investment portfolio. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, stockholders equity as a percentage of total assets was 8.6 and 7.7 , respectively. The capital levels of the Company currently exceed applicable regulatory guidelines to be considered well capitalized as of September 30, 2024. Unrealized losses on the investment portfolio are excluded from regulatory capital.
