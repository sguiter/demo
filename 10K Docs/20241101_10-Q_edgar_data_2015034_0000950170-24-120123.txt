GRAYSCALE BITCOIN MINI TRUST (BTC) 
 NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 Shares (the Seed Shares for per share). The Sponsor did not receive from the Trust, or any of its affiliates, any fee or other compensation in connection with the initial seed sale. Subsequently, on July 19, 2024, the Sponsor caused the Trust to distribute to the Sponsor in redemption of the Shares held by the Sponsor. On July 30, 2024, in connection with the approval of the 19b-4 Application on July 26, 2024 and the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-1, as amended, the Sponsor authorized the commencement of a redemption program. Effective July 31, 2024, the Trust creates and redeems Shares at such times and for such periods as determined by the Sponsor, but only in one or more whole Baskets. A Basket equals Shares. The creation of a Basket requires the delivery to the Trust of the amount of Bitcoin represented by one Share immediately prior to such creation multiplied by . The redemption of a Basket requires distribution by the Trust of the amount of Bitcoin represented by one Share immediately prior to such redemption multiplied by . The Trust may from time to time halt creations and redemptions for a variety of reasons, including in connection with forks, airdrops and other similar occurrences. Prior to July 31, 2024, the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to the sale, issuance and redemption of the Seed Shares. The Trust s investment objective is for the value of the Shares (based on Bitcoin per Share) to reflect the value of Bitcoin held by the Trust, less the Trust s expenses and other liabilities. The Trust may also receive Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency as a result of the Trust s investment in Bitcoin, in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement. Incidental Rights are rights to claim, or otherwise establish dominion and control over, any virtual currency or other asset or right, which rights are incident to the Trust s ownership of BTC and arise without any action of the Trust, or of the Sponsor or Trustee on behalf of the Trust; IR Virtual Currency is any virtual currency tokens, or other asset or right, received by the Trust through the exercise (subject to the applicable provisions of the Trust Agreement) of any Incidental Right. The Sponsor has committed to cause the Trust not to take any Affirmative Action to acquire any Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency, thereby irrevocably abandoning any Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency to which the Trust may become entitled in the future. Because the Sponsor has now committed to causing the Trust to irrevocably abandon all Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency to which the Trust otherwise would become entitled in the future, and causing the Trust not to take any Affirmative Actions, the Trust will not receive any direct or indirect consideration for the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency and thus the value of the Shares will not reflect the value of the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. In addition, in the event the Sponsor seeks to change the Trust s policy with respect to Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency, an application would need to be filed with the SEC by NYSE Arca seeking approval to amend its listing rules to permit the Trust to distribute the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency in-kind to an agent of the shareholders for resale by such agent. Grayscale Investments, LLC acts as the Sponsor of the Trust and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, Inc. DCG ). The Sponsor is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement. Grayscale is responsible for preparing and providing annual and quarterly reports on behalf of the Trust to investors and is also responsible for selecting and monitoring the Trust s service providers. As partial consideration for the Sponsor s services, the Trust pays Grayscale a Sponsor s Fee as discussed in Note 7. The Sponsor also acts as the sponsor and manager of other investment products including Grayscale Aave Trust (AAVE), Grayscale Avalanche Trust (AVAX), Grayscale Basic Attention Token Trust (BAT) (OTCQB: GBAT), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (NYSE Arca: GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCH) (OTCQX: BCHG), Grayscale Bittensor Trust (TAO), Grayscale Chainlink Trust (LINK) (OTCQX: GLNK), Grayscale Decentraland Trust (MANA) (OTCQX: MANA), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH) (NYSE Arca: ETHE), Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETC) (OTCQX: ETCG), Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) (NYSE Arca: ETH), Grayscale Filecoin Trust (FIL) (OTC Markets: FILG), Grayscale Horizen Trust (ZEN) (OTCQX: HZEN), Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTC) (OTCQX: LTCN), Grayscale Livepeer Trust (LPT) (OTCQX: GLIV), Grayscale MakerDao Trust (MKR), Grayscale NEAR Trust (NEAR), Grayscale Solana Trust (SOL) (OTCQX: GSOL), Grayscale Stacks Trust

, the Sponsor of the Trust issued a press release announcing that its board of directors declared a pro rata distribution on the Shares of the Trust, pursuant to which each holder of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) GBTC shares as of 4:00 PM ET on (the Record Date, and such holders, the GBTC Record Holders was entitled to receive Shares of the Trust, in connection with its previously announced initial creation and distribution of Shares of the Trust (such transactions collectively, the Initial Distribution ), as described in a definitive information statement on Schedule 14C filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 30, 2024 by GBTC. In the Initial Distribution, GBTC contributed approximately of the Bitcoin that it held as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date to the Trust, and each GBTC Record Holder was entitled to receive Shares pro rata based on a :1 ratio, such that for each one (1) GBTC share held by a GBTC Record Holder, such GBTC Record Holder was entitled to receive one (1) Share on the Distribution Date. In connection therewith, on July 31, 2024, GBTC completed its previously announced pro rata distribution of Shares of the Trust to shareholders of GBTC as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date and contributed to the Trust an amount of Bitcoin equal to approximately of the total Bitcoin held by GBTC as of the Record Date, equal to Bitcoin, with a value of , as consideration and in exchange for the issuance Shares of the Trust at per Share. It is expected that neither the GBTC Trust nor any beneficial owner of the GBTC shares will recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Initial Distribution.

The cost basis of investments in Bitcoin recorded by the Trust is the fair value of Bitcoin, as determined by the Trust, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the date of transfer to the Trust by the Authorized Participant, or Liquidity Provider, based on the Creation Baskets. The cost basis recorded by the Trust may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of each Share to investors. The Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider may realize significant profits buying, selling, creating, and redeeming Shares as a result of changes in the value of Shares or Bitcoin. On May 28, 2024, NYSE Arca filed an application with the SEC pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act to list the Shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca. On March 12, 2024, the Sponsor filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-1, as amended through July 29, 2024, to register the Shares of the Trust under the Securities Act of 1933. On July 26, 2024, the SEC approved NYSE Arca s 19b-4 application to list the Shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca as an exchange-traded product and on July 31, 2024, the Sponsor authorized the commencement of a redemption program once the registration statement on Form S-1, as amended, was declared effective.

on its net taxable income and certain distributions made by the Trust to shareholders would be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of the Trust s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Trust has defined the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. As of, and during the period from July 31, 2024 (the commencement of the Trust s operations) to September 30, 2024, the Trust did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax amounts. However, the Sponsor s conclusions concerning its determination of more-likely-than-not tax positions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, further implementation guidance, and ongoing analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Sponsor of the Trust has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions related to federal, state and local income taxes existed as of September 30, 2024 . 

 Shares of the Trust were held by related parties of the Trust. Genesis Global Trading, Inc. filed a certificate of dissolution during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and has therefore been removed from the list of related parties. The Sponsor s indirect parent, an affiliate of the Trust, holds a minority interest in Coinbase, Inc., the parent company of the Custodian, that represents less than of Coinbase Inc. s ownership. In accordance with the Trust Agreement governing the Trus t, the Trust pays a fee to the Sponsor, calculated as of the aggregate value of the Trust s assets, less its liabilities (which include any accrued but unpaid expenses up to, but excluding, the date of calculation), as calculated and published by the Sponsor or its delegates in the manner set forth in the Trust Agreement (the Sponsor s Fee ). The Sponsor s Fee accrues daily in U.S. dollars and is payable in Bitcoin, daily in arrears. The amount of Bitcoin payable in respect of each daily U.S. dollar accrual will be determined by reference to the same U.S. dollar value of Bitcoin used to determine such accrual. For purposes of these financial statements, the U.S. dollar value of Bitcoin is determined by reference to the Digital Asset Trading Platform Market that the Trust considers its principal market as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each valuation date. The Trust held no Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency as of September 30, 2024. No Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currencies have been distributed in payment of the Sponsor s Fee during the period from July 31, 2024 (the commencement of the Trust s operations) to September 30, 2024. As partial consideration for receipt of the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor is obligated under the Trust Agreement to assume and pay all fees and other expenses incurred by the Trust in the ordinary course of its affairs, excluding taxes, but including marketing fees; administrator fees, if any; custodian fees; transfer agent fees; trustee fees; the fees and expenses related to the listing, quotation or trading of the Shares on any secondary market (including customary legal, marketing and audit fees and expenses) in an amount up to in any given fiscal year; ordinary course legal fees and expenses; audit fees; regulatory fees, including, if applicable, any fees relating to the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; printing and mailing costs; the costs of maintaining the Trust s website and applicable license fees (together, the Sponsor-paid Expenses ), provided that any expense that qualifies as an Additional Trust Expense will be deemed to be an Additional Trust Expense and not a Sponsor-paid Expense.

in any given fiscal year and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters (collectively Additional Trust Expenses ). In such circumstances, the Sponsor or its delegate (i) will instruct the Custodian to withdraw from the Vault Balance Bitcoins in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust Expenses and (ii) may either (x) cause the Trust (or its delegate) to convert such Bitcoins into U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies at the Actual Exchange Rate or (y) when the Sponsor incurs such expenses on behalf of the Trust, cause the Trust (or its delegate) to deliver such Bitcoins in kind to the Sponsor, in each case in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust Expenses. On April 29, 2024, the Sponsor purchased Shares for per share). The Sponsor did not receive from the Trust, or any of its affiliates, any fee or other compensation in connection with the initial seed sale. Subsequently, on July 19, 2024, the Sponsor caused the Trust to distribute to the Sponsor in redemption of the Shares held by the Sponsor. As previously described in Note 4, on July 31, 2024, GBTC completed its previously announced pro rata distribution of Shares of the Trust to shareholders of GBTC as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date and contributed to the Trust an amount of Bitcoin equal to approximately of the total Bitcoin held by GBTC as of the Record Date, equal to Bitcoin, as consideration and in exchange for the issuance of Shares of the Trust. For the period from July 31, 2024 (the commencement of the Trust s operations) to September 30, 2024, the Trust incurred Sponsor s Fees of .

The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report or in Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements or other sections of our Registration Statement. 
 Trust Overview 
 The Trust is a passive entity that is managed and administered by the Sponsor and does not have any officers, directors or employees. The Trust holds Bitcoin and, from time to time on a periodic basis, issues Creation Baskets in exchange for deposits of Bitcoin. On July 30, 2024, in connection with the approval of application under Rule 19b-4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on July 26, 2024 and the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-277837), the Sponsor authorized the commencement of a redemption program. Shares of the Trust began trading on NYSE Arca on July 31, 2024, following the effectiveness of the Registration Statement. The Trust issues Shares only in one or more blocks of 10,000 Shares (a block of 10,000 Shares is called a Basket to certain Authorized Participants from time to time. Baskets are offered in exchange for Bitcoin. Through its redemption program, the Trust redeems Shares from Authorized Participants on an ongoing basis. As a passive investment vehicle, the Trust s investment objective is for the value of the Shares (based on Bitcoin per Share) to reflect the value of Bitcoin held by the Trust, determined by reference to the Index Price, less the Trust s expenses and other liabilities. While an investment in the Shares is not a direct investment in Bitcoin, the Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to gain investment exposure to Bitcoin. The Trust will not utilize leverage, derivatives or any similar arrangements in seeking to meet its investment objective. 
 The Trust is not managed like a business corporation or an active investment vehicle. 
 The Initial Distribution 
 On July 31, 2024, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) GBTC completed its previously announced pro rata distribution of 303,690,100 Shares of the Trust to shareholders of GBTC as of July 30, 2024 (the Record Date ), as described in GBTC s definitive information statement on Schedule 14C, filed with the SEC on July 30, 2024 (referred to as the Initial Distribution ). In connection therewith, on July 31, 2024, GBTC contributed to the Trust an amount of Bitcoin equal to 10 of the total Bitcoin held by GBTC as of the Record Date, equal to 26,935.83753443 Bitcoin, as consideration and in exchange for the issuance of Shares of the Trust. 
 Subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in GBTC s definitive information statement on Schedule 14C, filed with the SEC on July 30, 2024 (including with respect to the qualification of both GBTC and the Trust as grantor trusts for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the proper allocation of existing tax basis between GBTC shares and Shares of the Trust), it is expected that neither GBTC nor any beneficial owner of GBTC shares will recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Initial Distribution. Accordingly, it is expected that neither GBTC s contribution of Bitcoin to the Trust nor GBTC s distribution of Shares in the Trust to shareholders as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date will be reported to any beneficial owner of GBTC shares (or to any intermediary holding GBTC shares) as giving rise to income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or proceeds. Any beneficial owner of GBTC shares who received Shares of the Trust in the Initial Distribution, and any intermediary holding GBTC shares or Shares of the Trust, should consult their own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Initial Distribution, including the proper allocation of existing tax basis between GBTC shares and Shares of the Trust. Please refer to GBTC s definitive information statement on Schedule 14C, filed with the SEC on July 30, 2024, for more information, including other U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the Initial Distribution and ownership of Shares of the Trust. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Investment Transactions and Revenue Recognition 
 The Trust considers investment transactions to be the receipt of Bitcoin for Share creations and the delivery of Bitcoin for Share redemptions or for payment of expenses in Bitcoin. The Trust records its investment transactions on a trade date basis and changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. Realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with transactions including settling obligations for the Sponsor s Fee in Bitcoin. 
 19 

Principal Market and Fair Value Determination 
 To determine which market is the Trust s principal market (or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market) for purposes of calculating the Trust s net asset value in accordance with U.S. GAAP Principal Market NAV ), the Trust follows Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurement , which outlines the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for Bitcoin in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Trust to assume that Bitcoin is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. 
 The Trust only receives Bitcoin in connection with a creation order from the Authorized Participant (or a Liquidity Provider) and does not itself transact on any Digital Asset Markets. Therefore, the Trust looks to market-based volume and level of activity for Digital Asset Markets. The Authorized Participant(s), or a Liquidity Provider, may transact in a Brokered Market, a Dealer Market, Principal-to-Principal Markets and Exchange Markets (referred to as Trading Platform Markets in this Quarterly Report), each as defined in the FASB ASC Master Glossary (collectively, Digital Asset Markets ). In determining which of the eligible Digital Asset Markets is the Trust s principal market, the Trust reviews these criteria in the following order: 
 First, the Trust reviews a list of Digital Asset Markets that maintain practices and policies designed to comply with anti-money laundering AML and know-your-customer KYC regulations, and non-Digital Asset Trading Platform Markets that the Trust reasonably believes are operating in compliance with applicable law, including federal and state licensing requirements, based upon information and assurances provided to it by each market. 

Second, the Trust sorts these Digital Asset Markets from high to low by market-based volume and level of activity of Bitcoin traded on each Digital Asset Market in the trailing twelve months. 

Third, the Trust then reviews pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on Digital Asset Markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular Digital Asset Market. 

Fourth, the Trust then selects a Digital Asset Market as its principal market based on the highest market-based volume, level of activity and price stability in comparison to the other Digital Asset Markets on the list. Based on information reasonably available to the Trust, Trading Platform Markets have the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. The Trust therefore looks to accessible Trading Platform Markets as opposed to the Brokered Market, Dealer Market and Principal-to-Principal Markets to determine its principal market. As a result of the aforementioned analysis, a Trading Platform Market has been selected as the Trust s principal market. 

The Trust determines its principal market(or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine (i) if there have been recent changes to each Digital Asset Market s trading volume and level of activity in the trailing twelve months, (ii) if any Digital Asset Markets have developed that the Trust has access to, or (iii) if recent changes to each Digital Asset Market s price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the Trust s determination of its principal market. 
 The cost basis of Bitcoin received in connection with a creation order is recorded by the Trust at the fair value of Bitcoin at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the creation date for financial reporting purposes. The cost basis recorded by the Trust may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of the corresponding Shares to investors. 
 20 

Investment Company Considerations 
 The Trust is an investment company for U.S. GAAP purposes and follows accounting and reporting guidance in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies. The Trust uses fair value as its method of accounting for Bitcoin in accordance with its classification as an investment company for accounting purposes. The Trust is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and these differences could be material. 
 Review of Financial Results (unaudited) 
 Financial Highlights for the Period from July 31, 2024 (the commencement of the Trust s operations) to September 30, 2024 
 
 (All amounts in the following table and the subsequent paragraphs, except Share, per Share, Bitcoin and price of Bitcoin amounts, are in thousands) 

July 31, 2024 (the commencement of the Trust s operations) to September 30, 2024 

Net realized and unrealized loss on investment in Bitcoin 

(34,633) 

Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations 

(35,124) 

Net assets (1) 

2,142,086 

(1) Net assets in the above table and subsequent paragraphs are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP based on the Digital Asset Market price of Bitcoin on the Digital Asset Trading Platform that the Trust considered its principal market, as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. 

Net realized and unrealized loss on investment in Bitcoin for the period from July 31, 2024 (the commencement of the Trust s operations) to September 30, 2024 was 34,633), which includes a realized loss of 35) on the transfer of Bitcoins to pay the Sponsor s Fee, a realized loss of 3,289) on the sale of Bitcoins to meet redemptions, and net change in unrealized depreciation on investment in Bitcoin of 31,309). Net realized and unrealized loss on investment in Bitcoin for the period was driven by Bitcoin price depreciation from 65,222.44 per Bitcoin as of July 31, 2024 (the commencement of the Trust s operations), to 63,464.76 per Bitcoin as of September 30, 2024. Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was 35,124) for the period from July 31, 2024 (the commencement of the Trust s operations) to September 30, 2024, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized loss on investment in Bitcoin, plus the Sponsor s Fee of 491. Net assets increased to 2,142,086 at September 30, 2024. The increase in net assets resulted from the contribution of approximately 7,236 Bitcoin with a value of 443,672 to the Trust in connection with Share creations during the period and the contribution of approximately 26,936 Bitcoin with a value of 1,756,821 to the Trust in connection with the Initial Distribution from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC), partially offset by the aforementioned Bitcoin price depreciation, the redemption of approximately 412 Bitcoin with a value of 23,283 from the Trust, and the withdrawal of approximately 8 Bitcoin to pay the foregoing Sponsor s Fee. 
 Cash Resources and Liquidity 
 The Trust only receives and holds cash in order to facilitate creations and redemptions pursuant to Cash Orders, and has not otherwise had or maintained a cash balance at any time since the completion of the Initial Distribution. When selling Bitcoin in the Digital Asset Market to pay Additional Trust Expenses on behalf of the Trust, the Sponsor endeavors to sell the exact amount of Bitcoin needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than Bitcoin. In addition, upon the consummation or deemed failure of a Cash Order to create or redeem Baskets, the Trust will promptly return any excess cash it continues to hold with respect to such Cash Order to the applicable counterparty. As a consequence, the Sponsor expects that the Trust will not record any cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period. Furthermore, the Trust is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust expected to be incurred is the Sponsor s Fee and, if applicable, any Additional Trust Expenses. The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs.

(2) The Trust performed an assessment of the principal market at September 30, 2024, and identified the principal market as Coinbase. 

(3) As of September 30, 2024, the Principal Market NAV per Share was calculated using the fair value of Bitcoin based on the price provided by Coinbase, the Digital Asset Trading Platform that the Trust considered its principal market, as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. The Trust s NAV per Share is calculated using a non-GAAP methodology where the price is derived from multiple Digital Asset Trading Platforms. 

(4) The Trust s NAV per Share is derived from the Index Price as represented by the Index as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. The Trust s NAV per Share is calculated using a non-GAAP methodology where the price is derived from multiple Digital Asset Trading Platforms. See Business Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and Market Bitcoin Value The Index and the Index Price in the Registration Statement for a description of the Index and the Index Price. The Digital Asset Trading Platforms included in the Index as of September 30, 2024 were Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken, LMAX Digital, and Crypto.com. On October 27, 2024, the Index Provider added Bullish to the Index due to the trading platform meeting the Index Provider s minimum liquidity requirement, and did not remove any Constituent Trading Platforms as part of its scheduled quarterly review. See Business Valuation of Bitcoin and Determination of NAV in the Registration Statement for a description of the Trust s NAV per Share. 

T he Trust reflects creations and redemptions and the Bitcoin for proceeds receivable or payable with respect to such creations and redemptions, respectively, on the business day following the receipt of a notification of a creation or redemption order by an Authorized Participant. Creation and redemption orders are settled on T+1 or T+2, as established at the time of order placement, and therefore the Bitcoin for proceeds receivable or payable with respect to such creations and redemptions, respectively, are recorded as a receivable or payable until the Bitcoin are delivered or removed from the Trust for settlement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Trust had a net closing balance of 33,752.36277471 Bitcoin with a value of 2,140,929,585, based on the Index Price of 63,430.51 on September 30, 2024 (non-GAAP methodology). As of September 30, 2024, the total market value of the Trust s Bitcoin was 2,142,085,603, based on the price of one Bitcoin in the principal market (Coinbase) of 63,464.76 on September 30, 2024. 
 Historical NAV and Bitcoin Prices
