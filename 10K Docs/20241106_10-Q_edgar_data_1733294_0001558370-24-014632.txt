 as Torus Therapeutics, Inc. and subsequently changed its name to Generation Bio Co. Generation Bio Co. and its consolidated subsidiary, or the company, we, our or us, are innovating non-viral genetic medicines to provide durable, redosable treatments for potentially hundreds of millions of patients living with rare and prevalent diseases. We are developing two distinct and complementary platforms that we believe will enable highly differentiated therapeutic applications. Our first platform is a potent, highly selective cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle, or ctLNP, delivery system for nucleic acids, which is designed to avoid off-target clearance by the liver and spleen, enabling ctLNPs to persist in systemic circulation and allowing for highly selective and potent ligand-driven targeting to specific tissues and cell types. The identification and optimization of new ligands to target new tissues and cell types is an efficient, flexible, and modular process, which we believe will allow us to rapidly expand our portfolio. Our second platform is our novel immune-quiet DNA, or iqDNA, a partially single-stranded DNA, which is a variant of our closed-ended DNA, or ceDNA, designed to enable long-lasting high levels of gene expression from non-integrating episomes, while avoiding innate immune sensors that have long prevented DNA from use in non-viral systems. Underpinning the iqDNA platform is our highly scalable capsid-free manufacturing process that uses our proprietary cell-free rapid enzymatic synthesis, or RES, to produce highly pure iqDNA at scale. We are headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We are subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations, the ability to establish clinical- and commercial-scale manufacturing processes and the ability to secure additional capital to fund operations. Programs currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization of a product. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even if our development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, we will realize significant revenue from product sales. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of continuity of operations, realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Since inception, we have funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of instruments convertible into convertible preferred stock (which converted into convertible preferred stock in 2017), sales of convertible preferred stock (which converted into common stock in 2020), and sales of common stock in underwritten public offerings, at-the-market offerings, and in a private placement, as well as collaboration revenue under our collaboration with ModernaTX, Inc., or Moderna. We have incurred recurring losses, including net losses of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of million. We expect to continue to generate operating losses in the foreseeable future. As of November 6, 2024, the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least 12 months. We will need to obtain additional funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and/or licensing arrangements. We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, and we may not be able to enter into additional collaborative or strategic alliances or licensing arrangements. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. Arrangements with collaborators or others may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or programs. If we are unable to obtain funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, pipeline expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects. Although management will continue to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations when needed or at all.

 million ERC upon completion of an analysis providing reasonable assurance that we met the conditions set forth in the CARES Act and it was reasonably assured that we will receive the employee retention credit. We recorded the ERC in other long-term assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 related to labor costs recognized during 2020 and 2021. The ERC was recorded in research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses proportionately in the manner in which the qualified wages and related costs were classified. We have filed for refunds of the ERC and as of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have not received any refunds.

We assess our available-for-sale securities under the available-for-sale security impairment model in ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses , or ASC 326, as of each reporting date in order to determine if a portion of any decline in fair value below carrying value recognized on our available-for-sale securities is the result of a credit loss. We also evaluate our available-for-sale securities for impairment using a variety of factors including our intent to sell the underlying securities prior to maturity and whether it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell the securities before the recovery of their amortized basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not recognize any impairment or realized gains or losses on sales of available-for-sale securities , and we did not record an allowance for, or recognize, any expected credit losses.

 million, and paid us million in prepaid research funding. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to billion in milestone payments upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory, commercial, and sales milestone events, research term extension fees and exclusivity extension fees. Subject to reductions in specified circumstances, we will also be entitled to receive tiered royalties: (i) ranging from high-single-digits to low-double-digits on sales of licensed products that are directed to any liver target or non-liver target with respect to which Moderna has exercised its exclusive license option, and (ii) in the single digits on sales of Independent Program Products, including the exclusively licensed Independent Program Products directed to the Exclusive Targets. In consideration for the non-exclusive license granted by Moderna to us under the Joint Collaboration ctLNP Intellectual Property, we have agreed to pay Moderna tiered royalties in the single digits on sales of Independent Program Products that include mRNA, subject to reductions in specified circumstances. Royalties will be paid by each party, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, until the latest to occur of: (i) expiration of the last-to-expire of specified licensed patent rights; (ii) expiration of regulatory exclusivity; or (iii) ten years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product. In addition, in connection with the execution of the Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement, or the Share Purchase Agreement, with Moderna, pursuant to which we issued and sold shares of our common stock to Moderna, at a price of per share, for an aggregate purchase price of million, which closed concurrently with the execution of the Collaboration Agreement and resulted in Moderna becoming a related party. Under the Share Purchase Agreement, Moderna has the right, subject to certain terms and conditions, to purchase up to of the outstanding shares of our common stock (on a post-closing basis) in connection with a future equity financing of at least million by us. Moderna Agreement Assessment We assessed the promised goods and services under the Collaboration Agreement, in accordance with ASC 606. At inception, the Collaboration Agreement included combined performance obligation, which includes the license to the ctLNP technology to target indications outside of the liver and the related research services to develop such technology, as the two items are not distinct in context of the contract. The Collaboration Agreement also provides Moderna with options to receive additional research services and options to receive exclusive licenses. The options to receive exclusive licenses allow Moderna to develop and commercialize product candidates that utilize our ctLNP and ceDNA technology for targets within the liver, as well as utilizing the ctLNP technology to be developed as part of the Collaboration Agreement and our ceDNA technology for targets outside the liver. These options are considered to be a priced at a discount to its standalone selling price and therefore are considered to be material rights. The initial transaction price included a million upfront fee, premium paid over the fair value of the common stock of million in connection with shares issued and sold to Moderna under the Share Purchase Agreement, and estimated revenue associated with the payment for research services, including million in prepaid research services. We utilized the expected amount method to determine the amount of reimbursement for these activities. We utilized the most likely amount method to determine the amount of consideration to include in the transaction price related to any variable consideration related to exclusivity fees, and milestones, and the royalty payments are constrained based on the royalty constraint. amounts are included in the transaction price related to these elements.

 First liver program commercialization option license Second liver program commercialization option license First non-liver program commercialization option license Second non-liver program commercialization option license Third liver or non-liver program commercialization option license Total The transaction price was allocated to each unit of account based on the relative estimated standalone selling prices, over which management has applied significant judgment, of each element. We developed the estimated standalone selling price for combined performance obligation and each of the options to receive licenses primarily based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future cash flows associated with each license related to each specific program and an estimate of the costs to provide services including a reasonable return. In developing such estimate, we also considered applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreement, the probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the associated license. On a quarterly basis, we measure proportional performance of the combined performance obligation over time using an input method based on cost incurred relative to the total estimated costs by determining the proportion of effort incurred as a percentage of total effort we expect to expend. This ratio is then applied to the transaction price allocated to the combined performance obligation and each of the options to receive licenses. Any changes to these estimates will be recognized in the period in which they change as a cumulative catch up. All allocated consideration for the material rights is deferred until such time that Moderna exercises its options or the right to exercise the options expires. Upon exercise, we will determine the appropriate revenue recognition methodology and any other implications on the accounting treatment for the arrangement. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded additional revenue related to a change in estimate due to revisions in the research plan resulting in a reduction in the estimated timeline of future research services and total estimated costs . The change in estimate resulted in a million decrease in the allocated transaction price and a million increase in collaboration revenue, a million decrease in deferred revenue and a decrease in net loss per share, basic and diluted, for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

In July 2021, we entered into a lease agreement for a manufacturing facility in Waltham, Massachusetts, or the Seyon Lease. On January 31, 2024, we notified Waltham CenterPoint I Investment Group, LLC, or Landlord, of termination of the Seyon Lease due to Landlord s breach of its obligations to us under the Seyon Lease and returned possession of the premises to Landlord, effective January 31, 2024. On February 14, 2024, Landlord sent us a notice of the termination of the Seyon Lease due to our non-payment of rent. On February 20, 2024, Landlord served us with a complaint, filed in Massachusetts Superior Court, or the Court, with respect to the Seyon Lease. The complaint sought declaratory judgment that we unlawfully terminated the Seyon Lease and also asserted a claim for breach of contract damages. Following receipt of the complaint, we filed a counterclaim against Landlord asserting breach of contract and violation of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 93A. On October 29, 2024, the Court determined that although we did not have the right to terminate the Seyon Lease, Landlord s subsequent termination was effective, and that we had alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of contract and violation of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 93A by Landlord. We will continue to vigorously defend our rights with respect to this matter. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in connection with the termination of the Seyon Lease, we recorded a non-cash charge of million in an impairment of construction in progress. For additional information, refer to Note 7, Leases.

We completed the RIF during the second quarter of 2024. In connection with the RIF, affected employees were eligible to receive one-time severance benefits, including cash severance, temporary healthcare coverage, to the extent they were eligible for and elected such coverage, and transition support services, subject to each such employee entering into an effective separation agreement, which included a general release of claims against us. We offered a retention bonus to certain affected employees if such employees remained in continuous employment with us through their respective separation dates and executed a general release of claims against us.

Exercise of this option was not determined to be reasonably certain and thus was not considered in determining the operating lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. We posted a letter of credit in the amount of approximately million as a security deposit. The letter of credit is subject to increase if we were to sublease any portion of the leased premises. The Office and Lab Lease does not include any restrictions or covenants that had to be accounted for under the lease guidance.

The Seyon Lease commenced in December 2021, when we were granted access to the facility, and monthly rent payments began in September 2022; the total rent payment was expected to be approximately million for the 12-year lease term. We had an option to extend the Seyon Lease term for additional terms of each at the greater of the then-current base rent or the then-current fair market value. Exercise of this option was not determined to be reasonably certain and thus was not considered in determining the operating lease liability. In connection with the Seyon Lease, we provided a security deposit of million in the form of a letter of credit. We paid an initial monthly base rent of approximately million that increased annually, up to a monthly base rent of million. We were obligated to pay operating costs, taxes and utilities applicable to the facility. We were responsible for costs of constructing interior improvements within the facility that exceed a construction allowance of million provided by the landlord. As previously disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this Quarterly Report, the termination of the Seyon Lease is the subject of pending litigation with the landlord. As of September 30, 2024, the landlord has collected million from our security deposit in lieu of rent payments and has fully utilized such deposit. In connection with the termination of the Seyon Lease, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a material impairment loss of non-cash charges of million in an impairment of the Seyon Lease right-of-use asset, million in an impairment of construction in progress, and the write-off of million in tenant improvement allowance receivable from the landlord. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized

Accretion and other lease related expenses related to the Seyon Lease will continue to be recognized in loss on lease termination on our condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of September 30, 2024, as we have not met the criteria to extinguish the lease liability pursuant to ASC 405 Liabilities , and we had million in operating lease liability related to the Seyon Lease on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, in accordance with ASC 450 Contingencies , we have assessed the probability of realizing a material loss contingency for the potential losses, including obligations to pay any future variable lease costs, under the Seyon Lease. Based on this assessment, we have determined that it is not probable that we will be obligated to pay any such amounts. As a result, we have not accrued for any amounts related to the potential losses, primarily variable lease costs, such as common area fees and other charges, as they relate to the Seyon Lease. shares of common stock, par value per share, and shares of preferred stock, par value per share, all of which preferred stock is undesignated. In August 2024, we entered into an at-the-market sales agreement pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million. Upon our entry into this sales agreement, we terminated our prior at-the-market program pursuant to a prior sales agreement that we entered into in August 2021. At the time of termination, approximately million out of an aggregate of million remained unsold under the prior sales agreement. As of November 6, 2024, the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements, we have not issued and sold any shares of our common stock pursuant to the August 2024 sales agreement.

In January 2024, the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2020 Plan was increased from shares to shares. Upon the effectiveness of the 2020 Plan, we ceased granting additional awards under the 2017 Plan. The Plans are administered by the board of directors or, at the discretion of the board of directors, by a committee of the board of directors. The exercise prices, vesting and other restrictions on any award under the Plans are determined at the discretion of the board of directors, or its committee if so delegated.

Prior to our initial public offering, or IPO, in June 2020, the fair value of our common stock was determined by the board of directors. Subsequent to our IPO, fair value of common stock is based on quoted market prices. As of September 30, 2024, shares remained available for future issuance under the 2020 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards granted under the Plans that expire, terminate or are otherwise surrendered, cancelled, forfeited or repurchased by us at their original issuance price pursuant to a contractual repurchase right will be available for future awards under the 2020 Plan. Grant of stock options During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we granted time-based options to certain employees for the purchase of an aggregate of shares of common stock with a weighted average grant date fair value of per share that vest over a weighted average period of approximately . Employee stock purchase plan In May 2020, our board of directors adopted, and in June 2020, our stockholders approved, the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2020 ESPP, which became effective June 11, 2020. The 2020 ESPP is administered by our board of directors or by a committee appointed by the board of directors. The number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2020 ESPP automatically increases on the first day of each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year that commenced on January 1, 2021 and continuing for each fiscal year until, and including the fiscal year commencing on, January 1, 2030, in an amount equal to the lowest of (1) shares of common stock, (2) of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such date, and (3) an amount determined by the board of directors. In January 2024, the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2020 ESPP was increased from shares to shares. As of September 30, 2024, shares remained available for issuance under the 2020 ESPP. Stock-based compensation Stock-based compensation expense was classified in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as follows: General and administrative expenses Total As of September 30, 2024, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested time-based stock options and restricted stock units was million, with million expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1 years and million expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years, respectively.

Indemnification agreements In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, contract research organizations, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with members of our board of directors and our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. We have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and are not currently aware of any indemnification claims. Legal proceedings We, from time to time, may be party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. On February 20, 2024, our Landlord served us with a complaint, filed in the Court with respect to the Seyon Lease. The complaint sought declaratory judgment that we unlawfully terminated the Seyon Lease and also asserted a claim for breach of contract damages. Following receipt of the complaint, we filed a counterclaim against Landlord asserting breach of contract and violation of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 93A. On October 29, 2024, the Court determined that although we did not have the right to terminate the Seyon Lease, Landlord s subsequent termination was effective, and that we had alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of contract and violation of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 93A by Landlord. We will continue to vigorously defend the action and our rights with respect to this matter. As a result, we may continue to incur costs and expenses relating to this facility, and we may remain responsible for payments under the Seyon Lease, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is meant to provide material information relevant to an assessment of the financial condition and results of operations of our company, including an evaluation of the amounts and uncertainties of cash flows from operations and from outside resources, so as to allow investors to better view our company from management s perspective. It should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or Quarterly Report, and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report, in our Annual Report and in the other documents filed with the SEC, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Overview We are innovating non-viral genetic medicines to provide durable, redosable treatments for potentially hundreds of millions of patients living with rare and prevalent diseases. We are developing two distinct and complementary platforms that we believe will enable highly differentiated therapeutic applications. Our first platform is a potent, highly selective cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle, or ctLNP, delivery system for nucleic acids, which is designed to avoid off-target clearance by the liver and spleen, enabling ctLNPs to persist in systemic circulation and allowing for highly selective and potent ligand-driven targeting to specific tissues and cell types. The identification and optimization of new ligands to target new tissues and cell types is an efficient, flexible, and modular process, which we believe may allow us to rapidly expand our portfolio. We have demonstrated selective delivery of a T cell-targeted ctLNP carrying messenger RNA, or mRNA, cargo encoding a CAR with expression that was efficient and dose dependent. We plan to assess the efficacy of T cell-targeted ctLNPs delivering immune-quiet DNA, or iqDNA, in mice. Our second platform is our novel iqDNA, a partially single-stranded DNA, which is an optimized variant of our closed-ended DNA, or ceDNA, designed to enable long-lasting high levels of gene expression from non-integrating episomes, while avoiding innate immune sensors that have long prevented DNA from use in non-viral systems. Underpinning the iqDNA platform is our highly scalable capsid-free manufacturing process that uses our proprietary cell-free rapid enzymatic synthesis, or RES, to produce highly pure iqDNA at scale. We continue to leverage RES to advance our iqDNA platform as it allows for precise chemical and structural changes to DNA, enabling the enhancement of DNA functionality through the engineering of molecular design and components. We have developed a second generation of iqDNA that achieved greater luciferase expression than a first generation iqDNA. We are advancing a portfolio of programs guided by the potent and highly selective delivery of mRNA and/or iqDNA to T cells, hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs, and hepatocytes. Our work in T cells initially focuses on in vivo reprogramming of this cell type to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. Our HSC research is focused initially on in vivo gene editing of HSCs for hematologic disorders, prioritizing sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. Our work in hepatocytes prioritizes hemophilia A, a rare monogenic disease that results from mutations in a single gene, has significant unmet need, and clear biomarkers for development. We plan to expand our portfolio to include programs for additional indications in other tissues, including retina, skeletal muscle, and the central nervous system, or CNS, by developing discrete ctLNPs, each with a unique targeting ligand engineered to provide targeted delivery of mRNA and/or iqDNA to T cells, HSCs and hepatocytes or delivery of antibody genes to direct the liver to produce therapeutic antibodies from patients own cells, which we refer to as endogenous therapeutic antibody production, or ETAP. In November 2023, following a review of strategic priorities and a determination by our management and board of directors to implement a strategic reorganization to invest in our ctLNP delivery system to develop wholly-owned programs for extrahepatic cell types and to develop our iqDNA platform for our lead program in hemophilia A and other programs, we 

 22 

Table of Contents 
 announced a strategic reorganization, pursuant to which we undertook a reduction in force, or RIF, and implemented reductions in operational expenditures including current Good Manufacturing Practice readiness and manufacturing expenses. We completed the RIF during the second quarter of 2024. As part of the restructuring, we are prioritizing investment in the development of our ctLNP delivery system for wholly-owned programs in extrahepatic cell types and to develop iqDNA for our lead program in hemophilia A. In July 2021, we entered into a lease agreement to build out a current Good Manufacturing Practice-compliant manufacturing facility, in Waltham, Massachusetts, or the Seyon Lease. On January 31, 2024, we notified Waltham CenterPoint I Investment Group, LLC, or Landlord, of termination of the Seyon Lease due to Landlord s breach of its obligations to us under the Seyon Lease and returned possession of the premises to the Landlord, effective January 31, 2024. On February 14, 2024, Landlord sent us a notice of the termination of the Seyon Lease due to our non-payment of rent. On February 20, 2024, Landlord served us with a complaint, filed in Massachusetts Superior Court, or the Court, with respect to the Seyon Lease. The complaint sought declaratory judgment that we unlawfully terminated the Seyon Lease and also asserted a claim for breach of contract damages. Following receipt of the complaint, we filed a counterclaim against Landlord asserting breach of contract and violation of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 93A. On October 29, 2024, the Court determined that although we did not have the right to terminate the Seyon Lease, Landlord s subsequent termination was effective, and that we had alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of contract and violation of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 93A by Landlord. We will continue to vigorously defend the action and our rights with respect to this matter. In March 2023, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Moderna to collaborate on developing treatments for certain diseases by targeting delivery of nucleic acids to liver cells and certain cells outside of the liver. Under the Collaboration Agreement, the parties have agreed to collaborate on preclinical research programs relating to lipid nanoparticle, or LNP, delivery systems and nucleic acid payloads, with each party obtaining certain rights to intellectual property used in and arising out of such research programs. The research programs will be conducted pursuant to research plans and associated research budgets established by governance committees formed by the parties. Moderna will reimburse us for the internal and external costs we incur in conducting the research programs, to the extent consistent with such research plans and budgets. Each party will be solely responsible for its own clinical development and commercialization of products under the Collaboration Agreement. In addition, Moderna has exclusive options, upon payment of option exercise fees, to obtain worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable licenses under certain of our specified intellectual property to develop, manufacture and commercialize (a) products comprising LNP delivery systems and nucleic acid payloads that are directed to (i) up to two liver targets, (ii) up to two agreed-upon non-liver targets and (iii) a third liver or non-liver target and (b) Independent Program Products, which are products comprising LNP delivery systems that include mRNA that are directed to gene and protein targets in any of the agreed-upon immune cell types, or Cell Targets Types. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, in April 2023, Moderna made an upfront payment to us of 40.0 million, and paid us 7.5 million in prepaid research funding. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to 1.8 billion in milestone payments upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory, commercial, and sales milestone events, research term extension fees and exclusivity extension fees. Subject to reduction in specified circumstances, we will also be entitled to receive tiered royalties: (i) ranging from high-single-digits to low-double-digits on sales of licensed products that are directed to the liver targets and non-liver targets with respect to which Moderna has exercised its exclusive license options, and (ii) in the single digits on sales of Independent Program Products, including the exclusively licensed Independent Program Products. In consideration for the non-exclusive license granted by Moderna to us under the LNP-related intellectual property arising out of the research program focused on the discovery and development of ctLNPs directed to agreed-upon immune cell types, we have agreed to pay Moderna tiered royalties ranging from low-single-digits to mid-single-digits on sales of Independent Program Products that include mRNA, subject to reductions in specified circumstances. In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Moderna, pursuant to which we issued and sold 5,859,375 shares of our common stock to Moderna, at a price of 6.14 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of 36.0 million. In addition, under the Share Purchase Agreement, Moderna has the right, subject to certain 

 23 

Table of Contents 
 terms and conditions, to purchase up to 3.06 of the outstanding shares of our common stock (on a post-closing basis) in connection with a future equity financing of at least 25.0 million by us. For additional information on our collaboration with Moderna and the accounting thereunder, refer to Note 4, Collaboration and License Agreement. Since our inception in October 2016, we have focused substantially all of our resources on building our non-viral genetic medicine platforms, establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development activities, developing our manufacturing process, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We expect that any revenue recognized for the next several years will be derived primarily from our current collaboration with Moderna and any additional collaborations that we may enter into in the future. Historically, we have funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of instruments convertible into convertible preferred stock (which converted into convertible preferred stock in 2017), sales of convertible preferred stock (which converted into common stock in 2020), and sales of common stock in underwritten public offerings, at-the-market offerings, and in a private placement, as well as collaboration revenue under our collaboration with Moderna. In June 2020, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold 12,105,263 shares of our common stock, including 1,578,947 shares sold by us pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds of 210.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In January 2021, we issued and sold 9,200,000 shares of our common stock, including 1,200,000 shares sold by us pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares, in a follow-on public offering, resulting in net proceeds of 211.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In August 2024, we entered into an at-the-market sales agreement pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 237.0 million. Upon our entry into this sales agreement, we terminated our prior at-the-market program pursuant to a prior sales agreement that we entered into in August 2021. At the time of termination, approximately 237.3 million out of an aggregate of 250.0 million remained unsold under the prior sales agreement. As of November 6, 2024, the issuance date of this Quarterly Report, we have not issued and sold any shares of our common stock pursuant to the August 2024 sales agreement. Historically, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate any product revenue or product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more product candidates we may develop. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported net losses of 110.3 million and 91.4 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 681.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we: continue our current research programs and conduct additional research programs, including pursuant to our collaboration with Moderna; expand the capabilities of our proprietary non-viral genetic medicine platforms; advance any product candidates we identify into preclinical and clinical development; obtain, expand, maintain, defend and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; seek marketing approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; hire additional clinical, regulatory and scientific personnel; establish additional manufacturing sources and secure supply chain capacity sufficient to provide necessary quantities of any product candidates we may develop for clinical or commercial use; 

 24 

Table of Contents 
 ultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval; and add operational, legal, compliance, financial and management information systems and personnel to support our research, product development, and future commercialization efforts. 
 We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates we may develop. If we obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates we may develop, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercial capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. Further, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and/or licensing arrangements, including our collaboration with Moderna. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements when needed or on terms acceptable to us, we would be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures into the second half of 2027. We have based our estimates as to how long we expect we will be able to fund our operations on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. We could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, in which case we would be required to obtain additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. Components of Our Results of Operations Collaboration revenue Our revenue consists of collaboration revenue, including amounts recognized as payments for licenses, research funding and milestone payments earned under our collaboration and license agreements . Operating expenses Research and development expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our programs, which include: personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and severance expense, for employees engaged in research and development functions; expenses incurred in connection with our research programs, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract research organizations, or CROs, and regulatory agency fees; 

 25 

Table of Contents 
 the cost of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and capabilities and manufacturing drug substance and drug product for use in our research and preclinical studies, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract development organizations, or CDOs; 
 laboratory supplies and research materials; facilities, depreciation and amortization and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and payments made under third-party licensing agreements. 
 We expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. Our external research and development expenses consist of costs that include fees and other costs paid to consultants, contractors, CDOs and CROs in connection with our research, preclinical and manufacturing activities. We do not allocate our research and development costs to specific programs because costs are deployed across multiple programs and our platforms and, as such, are not separately classified. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially as we advance our programs into clinical development and expand our discovery, research and preclinical activities in the near term and in the future. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any product candidates we may develop. The successful development of any of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including the following: the timing and progress of preclinical studies, including investigational new drug, or IND, -enabling studies; the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; our ability to raise additional funds necessary to complete preclinical and clinical development of any product candidates we may develop; the timing of the submission and acceptance of IND applications or comparable foreign applications that allow commencement of future clinical trials for any product candidates we may develop; the successful initiation, enrollment and completion of clinical trials, including under Good Clinical Practices; our ability to achieve positive results from our future clinical programs that support a finding of safety and effectiveness and an acceptable risk-benefit profile in the intended patient populations of any product candidates we may develop; our ability to scale RES to produce clinical and initial commercial supply; our ability to establish arrangements with third-party manufacturers for preclinical, clinical and initial commercial supply; the availability of specialty raw materials for use in production of any product candidates we may develop; our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements; the receipt and related terms of regulatory approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other applicable regulatory authorities; 

 26 

Table of Contents 
 our ability to establish, obtain, maintain, enforce and defend patent, trademark, trade secret protection and other intellectual property rights or regulatory exclusivity for any product candidates we may develop and our technology; our ability to maintain a continued acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of our product candidates following approval; and the terms and timing of any existing or future collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any achievement of milestones and the receipt of payments thereunder. 
 A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to any product candidates we may develop could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any product candidates we may develop. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and severance expense, for employees engaged in executive, legal, finance and accounting and other administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations and accounting and audit services as well as direct and allocated facility-related costs. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as our research progresses toward clinical studies and we will increase our headcount. We also anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance costs and investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company. Loss on lease termination Loss on termination of lease consists of expenses recognized for the impairments of right-of-use asset and construction in progress, write-off of tenant improvement allowance receivable, accretion and other lease-related expenses in connection with the termination of the Seyon Lease. Other income and interest income, net Other income and interest income, net consists of interest income earned on our invested cash balances and other miscellaneous income unrelated to our core operations.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 15.7 million in collaboration revenue, compared to 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in collaboration revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to increased reimbursable activity under our Collaboration Agreement with Moderna, which commenced in the second quarter of 2023 and additional revenue related to the change in estimate, during the three months of September 30, 2024, due to revisions in the research plan resulting in a reduction in the estimated timeline of future research services and total estimated costs . The change in estimate resulted in an increase of 3.8 million in collaboration revenue and a decrease in net loss per share, basic and diluted, of 0.06 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information on our collaboration with Moderna and the accounting thereunder, refer to Note 4, Collaboration and License Agreement. Research and development expenses The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Research and development expenses were 15.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 21.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases in personnel-related costs of 1.8 million and stock-based compensation costs of 1.4 million were driven primarily by decreased headcount as a result of the RIF in November 2023. The decrease in preclinical and manufacturing costs of 2.0 million was driven primarily by decreased preclinical activities. Research and development expenses were 45.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 65.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases in personnel-related costs of 7.2 million and stock-based compensation costs of 4.2 million were driven primarily by decreased headcount as a result of the RIF in November 2023. The decrease in preclinical and manufacturing costs of 4.6 million was driven primarily by decreased preclinical activities. General and administrative expenses The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 vs 2023 2024 2023 2024 vs 2023 Personnel-related 2,966 3,646 (680) 9,076 12,195 (3,119) Stock-based compensation 2,232 3,130 (898) 6,997 9,685 (2,688) Facilities-related 1,396 2,495 (1,099) 5,024 7,443 (2,419) Professional and consultant fees 2,260 1,794 466 6,951 6,409 542 Other 327 576 (249) 1,076 1,742 (666) Total general and administrative expenses 9,181 11,641 (2,460) 29,124 37,474 (8,350) General and administrative expenses were 9.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in personnel-related costs of 0.7 million and stock-based compensation costs of 0.9 million were driven primarily by decreased headcount as a result of the RIF in November 2023. The decrease in facilities-related costs of 1.1 million was driven primarily by the termination of the Seyon Lease in January 2024. General and administrative expenses were 29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 37.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in personnel-related costs of 3.1 million and stock-based compensation costs of 2.7 million were driven primarily by decreased headcount as a result of the RIF in November 2023. The decrease in facilities-related costs of 2.4 million was driven primarily by the termination of the Seyon Lease in January 2024. Loss on lease termination During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a non-cash charge of 1.2 million and 59.6 million, respectively, in connection with the termination of the Seyon Lease. The non-cash charge recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a material impairment loss comprised of 45.8 million in right-of-use asset, 6.2 million in construction in progress, a write-off of 3.9 million in tenant improvement allowance receivable from the landlord and 3.7 million in accretion and other lease-related expenses. Other income and interest income, net Other income and interest income, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.6 million and 8.5 million as compared to 3.1 million and 8.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other income and interest income, net during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in interest yields on invested cash balances.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we support our continued research activities and development of our programs and platforms. We have not yet commercialized any product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all. We expect that any revenue recognized for the next several years will be derived primarily from our current collaboration with Moderna and any additional collaborations that we may enter into in the future. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have recognized 15.7 million in collaboration revenue under the Collaboration Agreement with Moderna. Historically, we have funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of instruments convertible into convertible preferred stock (which converted into convertible preferred stock in 2017), sales of convertible preferred stock (which converted into common stock in 2020) and sales of common stock in underwritten public offerings, at-the-market offerings and in a private placement, as well as collaboration revenue under our collaboration with Moderna. In August 2024, we entered into an at-the-market sales agreement pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 237.0 million. Upon our entry into this sales agreement, we terminated our prior at-the-market program pursuant to a prior sales agreement that we entered into in August 2021. At the time of termination, approximately 237.3 million out of an aggregate of 250.0 million remained unsold under the prior sales agreement. As of November 6, 2024, the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, we have not issued and sold any shares of our common stock pursuant to the August 2024 sales agreement. In March 2023, in connection with the Share Purchase Agreement with Moderna, we issued and sold 5,859,375 shares of our common stock to Moderna at a price of 6.14 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 36.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of 199.8 million. Cash flows The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (72,779) (27,767) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 24,245 (7,784) Net cash provided by financing activities 106 35,740 Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (48,428) 189 Operating activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities used 72.8 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of 110.3 million and the net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 30.6 million and offset by the net of non-cash charges of 68.1 million. Net changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of a 2.2 million increase in collaboration receivable, 12.2 million decrease of deferred revenue, a 2.8 million decrease in operating lease right-of-use assets, a 0.7 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a 2.8 million increase of other noncurrent assets, a 9.6 million decrease of accrued expense and other current liabilities and accounts payable and a 7.2 million decrease in operating lease liability. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, operating activities used 27.8 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of 91.4 million, offset by the net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 48.1 million and the net of non-cash charges of 15.6 million. Net changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of a 44.5 million increase of deferred revenue, a 4.8 million decrease in operating lease right-of-use assets, a 1.4 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a 0.9 million decrease of other noncurrent assets, offset by a 0.3 million increase in tenant receivable, a 1.2 million decrease of accrued expense and other current liabilities and accounts payable and a 2.0 million decrease in operating lease liability.

 Changes in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and accounts payable were generally due to payments of accrued employee bonus and severance benefits and the timing of vendor invoicing and payments. Investing activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 24.2 million, primarily due to 142.0 million in maturities of marketable securities offset by purchases of marketable securities of 115.9 million and property and equipment of 2.0 million during the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 7.8 million, primarily due to purchases of marketable securities of 296.0 million and property and equipment of 2.8 million during the period, offset by 291.0 million in maturities of marketable securities. Financing activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 0.1 million, consisting of 0.3 million in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and sales of common stock in connection to the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, offset 0.2 million in payments for repurchases of common stock for employee tax withholdings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 35.7 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds from the sale and issuance of our common stock to Moderna. Funding requirements We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance preclinical activities and initiate clinical trials for our product candidates in development. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on: the costs and scope of the continued development of our non-viral genetic medicine platforms; the identification of additional research programs and product candidates; the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting applications for patents; obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending against any intellectual property-related claims, including claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of third-party intellectual property; the scope, progress, costs and results of preclinical and clinical development for any product candidates we may develop; our research and development costs and the receipt of milestone payments under our collaboration with Moderna; the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of any product candidates we may develop; the cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale manufacturing activities, including the costs and resources required to manufacture our drug substance and drug product using external cleanroom facilities and/or CMOs; the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any product candidates we may develop for which we receive marketing approval; the costs of satisfying any post-marketing requirements; the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of product candidates we may develop for which we receive marketing approval; the costs of operational, financial and management information systems and associated personnel;

 the extent to which our previously announced RIF achieves the anticipated cost savings; the associated costs in connection with any acquisition of in-licensed products, intellectual property and technologies; and the costs of operating as a public company. 
 We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents. and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures into the second half of 2027. We have based our estimates as to how long we expect we will be able to fund our operations on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. We could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, in which case we would be required to obtain additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. Although we may receive potential future payments under our collaboration with Moderna, we do not have any committed external source of funds. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any future debt financing into which we enter would result in fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include grants of security interests on our assets and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, granting liens over our assets, redeeming stock or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that could adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our common stockholders. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital as and when needed, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any product candidate we may develop, or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities. If we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. See the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses and related disclosures and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements . We base our estimates on historical experience , known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances , the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources . We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. Management has determined that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to accrued research and development expenses and revenue recognition. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks. Interest Rate Market Risk We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We had marketable securities of 178.2 million as of September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 8.5 million in interest earned on our invested cash balances and we did not record any impairment charges to our marketable securities. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because a majority of our investments are in short-term securities. Interest rate changes would result in a change in the net fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the current market interest rate and the market interest rate at the date of purchase of the financial instrument. We currently do not seek to hedge this exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. We have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. Counterparty Credit Risk Our investment portfolio is subject to counterparty credit risk due to potential changes in the credit ratings of the issuers. A downgrade in the credit rating of an issuer of a debt security or further deterioration of the credit markets could result in a decline in the fair value of the debt instruments. Our investment guidelines prohibit investment in auction rate securities and we do not believe we have any direct exposure to losses relating from mortgage-based securities or derivatives related thereto such as credit-default swaps. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, respectively , evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
