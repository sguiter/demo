C ontract assets are defined as an entity's right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer when that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had contract assets. Contract liabilities are defined as an entity's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had contract liabilities that primarily related to unsatisfied performance obligations to provide customers with the right to use and update the online content over the remaining contract term of million and million, respectively. Contract liabilities, which are current and noncurrent, are included in "Deferred revenues" and "Other noncurrent liabilities" in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 
 
 The following is a summary of the change in contract liabilities from December 31, 2023 through September 30, 2024 : 

Additions to contract liabilities 
 Revenue 
 Foreign currency translation adjustment 
 Contract liabilities at September 30, 2024 

Our most significant remaining performance obligations relate to providing customers with the right to use and update the online content over the remaining contract term. Our disclosure of the timing for satisfying the performance obligation is based on the requirements of contracts with customers. However, from time to time, these contracts may be subject to modifications, impacting the timing of satisfying the performance obligations. These performance obligations, which are expected to be satisfied within one year, comprised approximately of th e balance at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 
 
 We recognize an asset for incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefits of those costs to be longer than one year. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had deferred commissions of mil lion and milli on, respectively, which have been included in "Prepaid expenses" and "Other noncurrent assets" in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . Our investments in registered investment companies are valued using quoted prices in active markets multiplied by the number of shares owned and were included in "Other current assets" in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 We elected not to carry our long-term debt at fair value. The carrying value of the long-term debt represents amortized cost, inclusive of unamortized premium, and net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs. We assess the fair value of these financial instruments based on an estimate of interest rates available to us for financial instruments with similar features, our current credit rating, and spreads applicable to us. The following table summarizes the carrying value and estimated fair value of these financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively: 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had securities without readily determinable market values of million and million, respectively, which were accounted for at cost. We do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investees operating and financial policies and do not hold investments in common stock or in-substance common stock in such entities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we also had investments in private companies of million and million, respectively, accounted for in accordance with ASC 323 - 10 - 25, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock ("ASC 323 - 10 - 25" ), as equity method investments. All such investments were included in "Other noncurrent assets" in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , there was provision for credit losses related to these investments. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we settled retained interests in non-public companies associated with previously disposed businesses and received proceeds of million, resulting in a net gain of million. The net gain was included in "Investment gain (loss)" in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Weighted-average remaining lease term - finance leases (in years) 
 Weighted-average discount rate - operating leases

Our right-of-use ('ROU') assets and le ase liabilities for finance leases were million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 . Our ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases were million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 . Our ROU a ssets for finance leases were included in "Fixed assets, net" in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our lease liabilities for finance leases were included in the "Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt" and "Long-term debt" in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets (see Note 10 . Debt). 
 
 On August 16, 2024, we early vacated floors within our Jersey City office. This transaction was accounted for as a lease modification in accordance with ASC 842. As a result of the lease modification, we reassessed the accounting for the Jersey City lease, resulting in a reduction of ROU assets and lease liabilities of million and million, respectively, and recognition of a gain of million. Additionally, we recorded an impairment of million of the remaining net book value of leasehold improvements. 
 
 Maturities of lease liabilities for the remainder of 2024 and the years through 2029 and thereafter are as follows:

percent of Rocket Enterprise Solutions GmbH ("Rocket") for a net cash purchase price of million, of which million represents a deferred payment and million represents a holdback payment. The majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill as we did not incur any material liabilities. Rocket s strong property claims and underwriting technology has been widely adopted by many of the largest insurers and service providers across Germany and Austria. Rocket has become a part of our claims category. The acquisition, which follows a strategic investment by Verisk in Rocket in 2022, will further Verisk's expansion in Europe and the Company s goal of helping insurers and claims service providers leverage more holistic data and technology tools to enhance the claims experience. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we incurred transaction costs of million and million, respectively. The transaction costs were included within "Selling, general and administrative" expenses in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. The 2024 acquisition was immaterial to our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , and therefore, supplemental information disclosure on an unaudited pro forma basis is not presented. 
 
 Acquisition Escrows and Related Liabilities 
 
 Pursuant to the related acquisition agreements, we have funded various escrow accounts to satisfy pre-acquisition indemnity and tax claims arising subsequent to the applicable acquisition dates. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the current portion of the escrows amounted to million and million, respecti vely. There were n o noncurrent portions of the escrows. The current portion of the escrows have been included in "Other current assets" in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the acquisition of Krug Sachverst ndigen GmbH ('Krug'), Mavera Holding AB ('Mavera'), and Morning Data Limited ('Morning Data') included acquisition-related contingent payments, for which the sellers of these acquisitions could receive additional payments by achieving the specific predetermined revenue, EBITDA, and/or EBITDA margin earn-out targets for exceptional performance. We believe that the liabilities recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 reflect the best estimate of acquisition-related contingent payments. The associated current portion of the contingent payments were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The associated noncurrent portion of contingent payments was million and 2.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 

million paid at closing (reflecting a base purchase price of million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments for, among other things, the cash, working capital, and indebtedness of the companies as of the closing) and up to million of additional contingent cash consideration based on Veritas Capital s future return on its investment paid through a Class C Partnership interest. 
 
 The Energy business, which was part of our Energy and Specialized Markets segment, was classified as discontinued operations per ASC 205 - 20 as we determined, qualitatively and quantitatively, that this transaction represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed from continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. Additionally, all assets and liabilities of the Energy business were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In connection with the held for sale classification, we recognized an impairment of million on the remeasurement of the disposal group held for sale, which has been included in discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations. Upon classification of the Energy business as held for sale, its cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment within shareholders equity was included with its carrying value, which primarily resulted in the impairment. When we closed on the sale of our Energy business on February 1, 2023, we recognized a loss of million. As a result of closing adjustments in the second and fourth quarter of 2023, we incurred an additional net loss of million. 
 
 The following table presents the financial results from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our consolidated statement of income for the periods indicated:

_______________ 
 1 See Note 6 . Acquisitions for more information. 
 
 Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may decide to first perform a qualitative assessment, or Step Zero impairment test, to determine whether it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred. The qualitative assessment includes a review of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, internal cost factors, and our own overall financial and share price performance, among other factors. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying amounts of our reporting units exceeds their fair value, we perform a quantitative assessment and calculate the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized. As of June 30, 2024, we completed our step zero impairment test at the reporting unit level and determined it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of our reporting units exceeded their fair values. We did not recognize any additional impairment charges related to our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , we continued to monitor these reporting units for events that would trigger an interim impairment test; we did not identify any such events. 

Impairments to long lived assets for the
 three and
 nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 were

 no impairments to long lived assets for the

The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to nondeductible litigation accruals recorded in the prior period. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to tax charges incurred in structuring the sale of our Energy business in the prior year, as well as additional tax benefits resulting from the Company's recognition of capital gains arising from the settlement o f our investment in non-public companies in the second quarter. The difference between statutory tax rates and our effective tax rate is primarily due to state and local taxes, partially offset by tax benefits attributable to equity compensation. 
 
 A number of jurisdictions have begun to enact legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s 15 global minimum tax regime with effect from January 1, 2024. These changes do not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

 Senior Notes 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million and million outstanding, respectively, and were in compliance with our financial and other covenants. 
 
 On June 5, 2024, we completed an issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2034 (the "2034 Senior Notes"). The 2034 Senior Notes will mature on June 5, 2034 and accrue interest at a fixed rate of per annum. Interest is payable semiannually on June 5th and December 5th of each year, beginning December 5th, 2024. The 2034 Senior Notes were issued at a discount of million and we incurred debt issuance costs of million. The original issuance discount and debt issuance costs were recorded in "Long-term debt" in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and these costs will be amortized to "Interest expense" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations over the life of the 2034 Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2034 Senior Notes were utilized partially for the tender offer of senior notes due in 2025 "2025 Senior Notes") and general corporate purposes. The indenture governing the 2034 Senior Notes restricts our ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate with, sell, lease, convey or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into, any other person or entity. 
 
 On June 7, 2024, we completed a cash tender offer for million, or , of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes. The consideration offered for each 1,000.0 principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes was (the "Purchase Price"). Net cash proceeds of the 2034 Senior Notes were used to pay the Purchase Price, plus accrued and unpaid interest. This reduced the outstanding balance to million. We recognized a million net gain on debt extinguishment comprised of million for the discount paid below par, partially offset by million of costs charged to expense on early debt modification, which were recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Credit Facilities 
 
 We have a syndicated revolving credit facility ("Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility") with a borrowing capacity of million with Bank of America N.A., HSBC Bank USA, N.A., JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Citibank, N.A., Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., TD Bank, N.A., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and the Northern Trust Company. The Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs and capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, and the share repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program"). As of September 30, 2024 , we were in compliance with all financial and other debt covenants under our Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the available capacity under the Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility was million and million, which takes into account outstanding letters of credit of million and million, respectively. 

shares of authorized common stock as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . Our common shares have rights to any dividend declared by the board of directors (the "Board"), subject to any preferential or other rights of any outstanding preferred stock, and voting rights to elect all current members of the Board. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the adjusted closing price of our common stock was and per share, respectively. 
 
 We have shares of authorized preferred stock, par value per share. The preferred shares have preferential rights over the common shares with respect to dividends and net distribution upon liquidation. We did not issue any preferred shares as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 
 
 On February 14, 2024, April 24, 2024, and July 24, 2024, our Board approved a cash dividend of per share of common stock issued and outstanding to the holders of record as of March 15, 2024, June 15, 2024, and September 15, 2024, respectively. Cash dividends of million and million were paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. 
 
 On October 23, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of 39 cents per share of common stock issued and outstanding. The dividend is payable on December 31, 2024, to holders of record as of December 13, 2024. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 In December 2023, March 2024, and June 2024 , we entered into Accelerated Share Repurchase ("ASR") agreements (the "December 2023 ASR Agreement", "March 2024 ASR Agreement", and "June 2024 ASR Agreement") to repurchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million, million, and million, with Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Citibank, N.A, respectively. All ASR agreements are accounted for as a treasury stock transaction and forward stock purchase agreement indexed to our common stock. The forward stock purchase agreements are classified as equity instruments under ASC 815 - 40, Contracts in Entity's Own Equity ("ASC 815 - 40 " and deemed to have a fair value of zero at the respective effective date. The aggregate purchase price was recorded as a reduction to stockholder's equity in our condensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholder's equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Upon payment of the aggregate purchase price on December 14, 2023, March 13 , 2024, and June 13, 2024 , we received initial deliveries of , , and shares of our common stock, respectively. Upon the final settlement of the December 2023 ASR Agreement, the March 2024 ASR Agreement, and the June 2024 ASR Agreement, in February 2024, April 2024 , and July 2024, we received , , and additional shares as determined based on the volume weighted average share price of our common stock, less a discount, of , , and 271.54 during the term of the December 2023 ASR Agreement, the March 2024 ASR Agreement, and the June 2024 ASR Agreement , respectively. These repurchases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in a reduction of outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS"). 
 
 In August 2024, we entered into an additional ASR agreement (the "August 2024 ASR Agreement") to repurchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million with Goldman Sachs Co. LLC. Upon payment of the aggregate purchase price on August 7, 2024, we received an initial delivery of shares of our common stock. The initial share delivery reduced our outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted EPS. Upon the final settlement of the August 2024 ASR Agreement in October 2024, we received additional shares, as determined based on the volume weighted average share price of our common stock, less a discount, of during the term of the August 2024 ASR Agreement. 
 
 We utilized cash received from operations for these repurchases. As of September 30, 2024, we had million available on our authorization to repurchase shares. 
 
 Through the third quarter of 2024 , we recorded total excise tax of million, which has been included within treasury stock, as part of the cost basis of the stock repurchased, and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 . 

Treasury Stock 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , our treasury stock consisted of shares of common stock, carried at cost. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we transferred shares of common stock from the treasury shares at a weighted average treasury stock price of per share. 
 
 Earnings Per Share 
 
 Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Verisk by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding, using the treasury stock method, if the dilutive potential common shares, including vested and nonvested stock options, nonvested restricted stock awards, nonvested restricted stock units, nonvested performance share units ("PSU"), and nonvested deferred stock units, had been issued. 
 
 The following is a presentation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 : 

Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax 
 Net income attributable to Verisk 
 Denominator: 
 Weighted average number of common shares used in basic EPS 
 Effect of dilutive shares: 
 Potential common shares issuable from stock options and stock awards 
 Weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares used in diluted EPS 

The potential shares of common stock that were excluded from diluted EPS were and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, because the effect of including those potential shares was anti-dilutive.

shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance under our 2021 Incentive Plan. Cash received from stock option exercises for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. 
 
 We grant equity awards to our key employees. The nonqualified stock options have an exercise price equal to the adjusted closing price of our common stock on the grant date, with a ten -year contractual term. The fair value of the restricted stock is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The restricted stock is not assignable or transferable until it becomes vested. PSUs vest at the end of a three -year performance period, subject to the recipient s continued service. Each PSU represents the right to receive one share of our common stock and the ultimate realization is based on our achievement of certain market and financial performance criteria and may range from to of the recipient s target levels of established on the grant date. The fair value of PSUs based on market conditions is determined on the grant date using the Monte Carlo Simulation model. The fair value of PSUs based on financial performance conditions is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. We recognize the expense of the equity awards ratably over the vesting period, which could be up to four years. 
 
 In January 2024, we granted nonqualified stock options, shares of restricted stock, and PSUs to key employees. The nonqualified stock options and restricted stock have a graded service vesting period of four years. The PSUs granted consisted of PSUs that are based on the achievement of relative total shareholder return as compared to the companies that comprise the S P 500 index ("TSR-based PSUs") and PSUs that are tied to the achievement of certain financial performance conditions, namely incremental return on invested capital ROIC-based PSUs ). Each of the TSR-based PSUs and ROIC-based PSUs have a three -year performance period, subject to the recipients' continued service. The grant date fair value of the ROIC-based PSUs is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The related performance condition is driven by the incremental return on invested capital based on net operating profit. The ultimate realization of the PSUs may range from to of the recipient s target levels established on the grant date. 
 
 A summary of the status of the stock options, restricted stock, and PSUs awarded under our 2021 and 2013 Incentive Plans as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 and changes during the interim period are presented below: 

Granted 
 Dividend reinvestment N/A 
 Exercised or lapsed 210.07 
 Canceled, expired or forfeited 
 Outstanding at September 30, 2024 
 Exercisable at September 30, 2024 
 Exercisable at December 31, 2023 
 Nonvested at September 30, 2024 
 Expected to vest at September 30, 2024 (1) 

1 Includes estimated performance achievement 

The fair value of the stock options granted was estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model that uses the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 : 

Expected volatility 
 Risk-free interest rate 
 Expected term in years 
 Dividend yield 
 Weighted average grant date fair value per stock option 

The expected term for the stock options granted was estimated based on studies of historical experience and projected exercise behavior. However, for certain awards granted, for which no historical exercise pattern exists, the expected term was estimated using the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury zero coupon securities with a maturity equal to the expected term of the equity award. The volatility factor is calculated using historical daily closing prices over the most recent period commensurate with the expected term of the stock option awards. The expected dividend yield was based on our expected annual dividend rate on the date of grant. 
 
 Intrinsic value for stock options is calculated based on the exercise price of the underlying awards and the adjusted closing price of our common stock as of the reporting date. Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were recorded as income tax benefit in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. This tax benefit is calculated as the excess of the intrinsic value of options exercised and restricted stock lapsed in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting purposes. The weighted average remaining contractual terms were years and years for the outstanding and exercisable stock options, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , there was million of total unrecognized compensation costs, exclusive of the impact of vesting upon retirement eligibility, related to nonvested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under our 2021 and 2013 Incentive Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of ye ars. 
 
 Our U.K. Sharesave Plan offers qualifying employees in the United Kingdom the opportunity to own shares of our common stock. Employees who elect to participate are granted stock options, of which the exercise price is equal to the average of the closing price on the five trading days immediately preceding the plan invitation date discounted by , and enter into a savings contract, the proceeds of which are then used to exercise the options upon the three -year maturity of the savings contract. As of September 30, 2024 , there were s hares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance under our U.K. Sharesave Plan . 
 
 Our ESPP offers eligible employees the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount of its fair market value at the time of purchase. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we issued and share s of common stock at a weighted discounted pric e of and for the ESPP, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , there were shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance under our ESPP. 

to equity securities and to debt securities. We also provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to certain qualifying active and retired employees. Our Postretirement Health and Life Insurance Plan (the "Postretirement Plan"), which has been frozen, is contributory, requiring participants to pay a stated percentage of the premium for coverage. 
 
 The components of net periodic (benefit) cost for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below: 

Expected return on plan assets 
 Amortization of prior service cost 
 Amortization of net actuarial loss

Plaintiffs seek actual damages in the amount of per violation under the statute, punitive damages, injunctive relief ordering compliance with Daniel s Law, permanent injunctive relief, including the appointment of a qualified independent expert to ensure compliance with Daniel s Law, and reasonable attorney s fees and costs. On June 21, 2024, the court issued a lack of prosecution warning to Atlas, advising that the case will be dismissed without prejudice if service is not effectuated by August 20, 2024. The case was dismissed without prejudice on August 26, 2024. On October 11, 2024, Plaintiffs served Verisk with the Summons and Complaint, indicating their intent to revise the lawsuit. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the liability related to this matter, as the case is still in its early stages. 
 
 On January 30, 2023, Plaintiffs Justin Ahringer and Michael Donner filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court, Central District of California, titled Ahringer et al. v. LoanDepot, Inc. and Verisk Analytics, Inc. d/b/a Jornaya, Case No.: 8:23 -cv- 00186. Plaintiffs assert violations of California s Invasion of Privacy Act, Unfair Competition Law, and a violation of class members privacy rights under the California Constitution. Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants recorded visitors electronic communications without their consent. Plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide class of individuals who visited LoanDepot.com and provided personal information on the website s forms to receive a quote or apply for a loan. They allege that the aggregate claims of all members of the proposed class exceeds million. Plaintiffs seek compensatory, statutory or punitive damages or restitution, as well as reasonable attorney s fees and other costs. We filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs claims on April 13, 2023. The parties engaged in jurisdictional discovery in response to the court s demand to Plaintiff to demonstrate why this case should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court found jurisdiction is proper and partially denied our motion on February 7, 2024. We filed our Answer to Plaintiffs' Complaint on February 22, 2024. The parties have agreed to a settlement in principle. 
 
 On June 27, 2022, Plaintiff Loretta Williams brought a putative class action against Lead Intelligence, Inc. d/b/a Jornaya we, our, or us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, titled Williams v. DDR Media, LLC and Lead Intelligence, Inc. d/b/a Jornaya, Civil Action No. 3:22 -cv- 03789. The Complaint alleges that the Defendants violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act, Cal. Penal Code 631 CIPA and invaded Plaintiff s and class members privacy rights when Defendants purportedly recorded visitors visits to the scrappyrent2own.com website without prior express consent. It is further alleged that this conduct constitutes a violation of the California Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. Prof. Code Section 17200 et seq. and the California Constitution. The Complaint seeks class certification, injunctive relief, statutory damages in the amount of for each violation, attorneys fees and other litigation costs. Our motion to compel arbitration was fully briefed as of January 27, 2023. It was denied on February 28, 2023. We filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff s claims on April 13, 2023. On August 18, 2023 the court granted our motion, dismissing Plaintiff s claims without prejudice, but giving Plaintiff an opportunity to amend her claims by September 20, 2023. Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint SAC on September 20, 2023. Our motion to dismiss the SAC was fully briefed on December 18, 2023. It was denied on January 30, 2024. The court held an initial case management conference for February 9, 2024 and allowed the parties to engage in limited discovery. Our renewed motion to dismiss was filed on July 19, 2024 and oral argument was held on September 20, 2024. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the liability related to this matter, as the case is still in its early stages. 
 
 On December 15, 2021, Plaintiff Jillian Cantinieri brought a putative class action against Verisk Analytics, Insurance Services Office and ISO Claims Services, Inc. we, our, or us in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, titled Cantinieri v. Verisk Analytics Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 2:21 -cv- 6911. The Complaint alleges that we failed to safeguard the personally identifiable information (PII) of Plaintiff and the members of the proposed classes from a purported breach of our databases by unauthorized entities. Plaintiff and class members allege actual and imminent injuries, including theft of their PII, fraudulent activity on their financial accounts, lowered credit scores, and costs associated with detection and prevention of identity theft and fraud. They seek to recover compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, disgorgement of earnings and profits, and attorney s fees and costs. We filed our motion to dismiss Plaintiff s claims on April 22, 2022. On March 30, 2023, the court denied our motion to dismiss without prejudice, allowing us an opportunity to re-file the motion once limited jurisdictional discovery has been completed. Our renewed motion to dismiss was fully briefed on February 16, 2024. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the liability related to this matter, as the case is still in its early stages.

Executive Summary 
 
 Key Performance Metrics 
 
 Revenue growth . We use year-over-year revenue growth as a key performance metric. We assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers, and strategic acquisitions of new businesses. 
 
 We use year-over-year EBITDA growth as metrics to measure our performance. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets. We calculate EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. The respective nearest applicable GAAP financial measures are net income and net income margin. Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders, and others in their evaluation of companies; EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating income, net income, or cash flow from operating activities reported under GAAP. Management uses EBITDA and EBITDA margin in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment company performance. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater transparency regarding our operating performance, and facilitate period-to-period comparisons. Some of these limitations involved in the use of EBITDA are: 
 
 EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. 
 
 EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs. 
 
 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. 
 
 Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 
 EBITDA growth . We use EBITDA growth as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost management and investing for future growth. EBITDA growth allows for greater transparency regarding our operating performance and facilitate period-to-period comparison. 
 
 EBITDA margin. We use EBITDA margin as a performance measure to assess segment performance and scalability of our business. We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth. 
 
 Revenues 
 
 We earn revenues through agreements for hosted subscriptions, advisory/consulting services, and for transactional solutions, recurring and non-recurring. Subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full u pon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year. As a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments. Examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database, or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period. In general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the busi ness. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , approximately 81 and 80 of our insurance revenues were derived from hosted subscriptions through agreements (generally one to five years) for our solutions, respectively. 
 
 We also provide advisory/consulting services, which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their subscriptions. In addition, certain of our solutions are paid for by our customers on a transactional basis, recurring and non-recurring. For example, we have solutions that allow our customers to access property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a P C insurance or a workers' compensation claim with information in our databases, or use our repair cost estimation solutions on a case-by-case basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , approximately 19 and 20 of our insurance revenues were derived from providing transactional and advisory/consulting solutions, respectively.

Operating Costs and Expenses 
 
 Personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel expenses, which represented approximately 57 and 59 of our total operating expenses (excluding gains/losses related to dispositions) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs. 
 
 We assign personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expense, based on the actual costs associated with each employee. We categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, salespeople, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses. A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, is also either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses based on the nature of the work being performed. 
 
 While we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues. Historically, our EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses. However, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions and new businesses, which may offset margin expansion. 
 
 Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses. Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition, disposition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions, and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions. Our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs. A portion of the other costs such as facilities, insurance, and communications are also allocated to selling, general and administrative expenses based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee. Our selling, general and administrative expenses exclude depreciation and amortization.

 EBITDA is a financial measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of our segments. "EBITDA" is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets. See Note 14 . of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders, and others in their evaluation of companies. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating income, net income, or cash flows from operating activities reported under GAAP. Management uses EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance. Some of these limitations are: 

EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 

Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to tax charges incurred in structuring the sale of our Energy business in the prior year, as well as additional tax benefits resulting from the Company's recognition of capital gains arising from the settlement of our investment in non-public companies in the second quarter . The difference between statutory tax rate s and our effective tax rate is primarily due to state and local taxes, partially offset by tax benefits attributable to equity compensation.

Energy and Specialized Markets 
 
 The Energy business within the "Energy and Specialized Markets" segment was classified as discontinued operations per the guidance in ASC 205-20. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed from continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. On February 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our Energy business. 
 
 As a result of these sale transactions, we have excluded the Energy and Specialized Markets from our management's discussion and analysis of the results of operations by segment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As o f September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling 459.2 million and 303.9 million, respectively. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents in higher credit quality financial institutions in order to limit the amount of credit exposure. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , a vast majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents is with TD Bank, N.A., and JPMorgan Chase N.A. Subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year. Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year. We have historically generated significant cash flows from operations. As a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our Credit Facility, we expect that we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and to fuel our future growth plans. 
 
 We have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered. When cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and cash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (deferred revenues). This current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services. In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows. Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services. 
 
 We have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we repurchased 750.0 million (inclusive of 60.0 million in treasury stock not yet settled) and 2,549.8 million (inclusive of 500.0 million in treasury stock then not yet settled), respectively, of our common stock. The repurchase of our common stock in the third quarter of 2024 was funded using cash from operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we also paid dividends of 166.6 million and 147.9 million, respectively. 
 
 Financing and Financing Capacity 
 
 We had total debt, excluding finance lease liabilities, unamortized discounts and premium, and debt issuance costs of 3,050.0 million and 2,850.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, and we were in compliance with our financial and other covenants. The debt at September 30, 2024, primarily consists of senior notes issued in 2024, 2023, 2020, 2019, and 2015. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually each year. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs were recorded as "Long-term debt" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and will be amortized to "Interest expense" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within this Form 10-Q over the life of the respective senior note. The indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions, and consolidate with, sell, lease, convey, or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into, any other person or entity. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding notes, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See Note 10. for additional information on our financing activities. 
 
 We have a 1,000.0 million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility with Bank of America N.A., HSBC Bank USA, N.A., JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Citibank, N.A., Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., TD Bank, N.A., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and the Northern Trust Company with a maturity date of April 5, 2028. Borrowing under the facility is payable at an interest rate of SOFR plus 100.0 to 162.5 basis points, depending on the public debt rating. The financial covenants require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio of less than 3.75 to 1.0 . At our election, the maximum consolidated funded debt leverage ratio could be permitted to increase to 4.50 to 1.0 (no more than once) and to 4.25 to 1.0 (no more than once) in connection with the closing of a permitted acquisition. The Syndicated Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs and capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, and the Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial and other debt covenants under the Syndicated Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the available capacity under the Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility was 995.5 million and 995.4 million, which takes into account outstanding letters of credit of 4.5 million and 4.6 million, respectively.

 Contractual Obligations 
 
 There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of our business from those reported in our annual report on Form 10-K and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquisition purchase price allocations, revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefits, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and allowance for doubtful accounts. Actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions. Some of the judgments that management makes in applying its accounting estimates in these areas are discussed under the heading "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our annual report on Form 10-K dated and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2024. Since the date of our annual report on Form 10-K, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates other than the items noted below.

 Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives at the reasonable assurance level.
