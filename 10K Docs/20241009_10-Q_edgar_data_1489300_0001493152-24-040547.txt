ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The
following information should be read in conjunction with (i) the financial statements of Zhanling International Ltd, a Nevada corporation,
and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q together with (ii) the more detailed business information and the May 31,
2024 audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company s most recent Transition Report on Form 10-KT for the
year ended May 31, 2024 (File No. 000-54301), as filed with the SEC on August 26, 2024. Statements in this section and elsewhere in this
Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute forward-looking statements. 

OVERVIEW 

Zhanling
International Ltd (the Company or we was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 16, 2009 and the Company
is a development-stage company which intended to acquire companies in large consumption platform in China. The Company s sole purpose
currently is to target and complete a merger or acquisition with a private entity. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

As
of August 31, 2024, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of 396,180, had a shareholder deficit of 14,344, and the Company s
current liabilities exceeded its current assets by 3,006. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net
loss of 5,970, and cash used in operating activities during the period was 7,996. Management has plans to seek additional capital through
a private placement of its Common Stock or further director loans as needed. Additionally, the Company s additional capital may
be supported by related party.These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue. 

To
date the Company has no operations or revenues and consequently has incurred recurring losses from operations. No revenues are anticipated
until we complete the Plan of Operation described in this Form 10-Q and implement our initial business plan. The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund our business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations.
Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

USE
OF ESTIMATES 

In
preparing these condensed financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities in the balance sheets, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Refer
to Note 1 in the accompanying financial statements. 

12 

PLAN
OF OPERATION 

Our
principal offices were relocated on Unit 305-306, 3/F., New East Ocean Centre, 9 Science Museum Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong. 

The
Company planned to execute a multi-phase exploration program at inception of July 16, 2009. From inception to August 31, 2024, the Company
has had limited business operations and has no revenues generated from operations since incorporation. We are now in the process of evaluation
any potential business opportunities though we cannot assure that it will be able to commence profitable operations. 

Results
of Operations 

Three
Months Ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 

We
recorded no revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023. 

The
result of operation expenses are primarily professional fees of 5,970 and 5,450 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023
respectively, reflecting a n increase of 520, or 9 .54 . The expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2024 were primarily consisted
of professional fees such as audit fee and Edgar services fee. The operation expenses were relatively flat when compared to the prior
year period. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

For
the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to three months ended August 31, 2023 

As
of August 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no cash on hand. Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended August 31, 2024
was 7,996 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of 10,664 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease in
cash provided by operating activities was mainly due to operating expenses. 

We
had no cash used in investing activities for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was 7,996 as compared to net cash provided by financing
activities of 10,664 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The net cash provided by financing activities for the three months
ended August 31, 2024 was mainly the loan advanced from former director Mr.YongQing Liu. 

We
do not have sufficient cash on hand to fund our ongoing operational expenses beyond 12 months. We will need to raise funds to commence
our exploration program and fund our ongoing operational expenses. Additional funding will likely come from equity financing from the
sale of our Common Stock or sale of part of our interest in our mineral claims. If we are successful in completing an equity financing,
existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our Company. We do not have any financing arrangement and we cannot
provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our Common Stock to fund our exploration
activities and ongoing operational expenses. In the absence of such financing, our business will likely fail. There are no assurances
that we will be able to achieve further sales of our Common Stock or any other form of additional financing.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

As
a smaller reporting company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide the information called for
by this Item 3. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

DISCLOSURE
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: 

We
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of August 31, 2024. This evaluation was carried out by our Chief Executive and Financial Officer,
who also serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
Executive and Financial Officer concluded that, as of August 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due
to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that,
as of August 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: Inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control
objectives. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 31, 2024, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
