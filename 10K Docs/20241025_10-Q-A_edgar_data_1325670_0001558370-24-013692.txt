Background of the Restatement As previously reported in the Company s Form 8-K filed on March 1, 2024, a s part of the Company s year-end reporting process in the first quarter of 2024, the Company determined that the transfer of certain loans from Primis Bank to other financial institutions in the first quarter of 2023 did not qualify for sales treatment under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP and should have been accounted for as secured borrowings . Also, as previously reported in the Company s Form 8-K filed on August 12, 2024, the Company completed its initial consultation process with the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC related to a portion of our consumer loans originated using a third party that sources and subsequently manages the portfolio of loans (the Consumer Program ). The Company received a non-objection from the SEC to the Company s accounting conclusions required to correct the prior accounting for the Consumer Program. As a result, in consultation with the Company s Audit Committee to its Board of Directors and its independent registered public accounting firm, Forvis Mazars, LLP, management determined that the corrections to the Consumer Program accounting was material to the financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023, which are also being restated in this Form 10-Q/A.

As of March 31, 2023 the amortized cost of those loans recorded in loans held for investment in our balance sheet was million. of the loans were past due or on nonaccrual as of March 31, 2023 and we had charge-offs of these loans during the three months ended March 31, 2023. See Note 7 Debt and Other Borrowings for additional information on transfers accounted for as secured borrowings. million. The fraud dated back to the origination of several loans to a customer in 2010. Management believes, on the advice of its counsel, its insurance broker and a third party forensic auditor, that the losses are recoverable under the Company s insurance policies and is working through the claims process. The Company has evaluated the effect of the error, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and believes the impact to prior years is immaterial to each respective period assessed. However, the Company s quantitative and qualitative assessments of the fraud losses on its projected 2023 annual earnings was expected to be material at the time the evaluation was performed as of June 30, 2023. Accordingly, the Company made the decision to report the losses in the respective periods in which they were incurred in its future Form 10-Q and Form 10-K filings by revising impacted periods beginning with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of June 30, 2023. For all of its filings on and after June 30, 2023, the Company revised opening retained earnings of the earliest period presented for losses incurred in earlier periods and revised all prior periods presented in the filing for losses incurred related to the period. Accordingly, the Company has revised prior periods presented in this Form 10-Q/A to reflect the fraud losses in the respective period incurred, with any losses incurred prior to January 1, 2022 adjusted in the January 1, 2022 opening retained earnings balance as previously reported in the Company s restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022. The table below discloses the net change (increase or (decrease)) included in each condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss) line items in this Form 10-Q/A, as a result of the revisions discussed above. The revisions to the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 resulted in no change on previously reported basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations. ) Increase in noninterest expenses Decrease in income tax expense ) ) Net decrease in net income from continuing operations ) ) Restatement and Revision of Previously Issued Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements On February 26, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Company s management team concluded, following discussions with the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, Forvis Mazars, LLP Forvis ), that the Company s previously issued unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 should no longer be relied upon. The accounting matters underlying the Company s conclusion related to transfers of loans by the Company s subsidiary, Primis Bank, of approximately million (the Transferred Loans to another financial institution during the first quarter of 2023. As part of the Company s 2023 year-end reporting process in the first quarter of 2024, the Company determined that the transfer of the Transferred Loans from Primis Bank to the other financial institution did not qualify for sales treatment under U.S. GAAP and should have been accounted for as secured borrowings.

Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics, and considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. With regard to U.S. Treasury and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by the U.S. government, or agencies thereof, it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the amortized cost basis of the securities as such securities are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. With regard to securities issued by States and political subdivisions and other held-to-maturity securities, management considers (i) issuer bond ratings, (ii) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (iii) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities and (iv) internal forecasts. As of March 31, 2023, Primis had an immaterial allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities. The unrealized losses related to investment securities available-for-sale identified as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and do not indicate credit-related impairment. Primis performs quantitative and qualitative analysis in this determination. As a result of the Company s analysis, none of the securities were deemed to require an allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2023 and

Accrued Interest Receivable Accrued interest receivable on loans totaled million and million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. In determining whether or not a borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations for each class of loans, we consider the borrower s debt service capacity through the analysis of current financial information, if available, and/or current information with regards to our collateral position. Regulatory provisions would typically require the placement of a loan on nonaccrual status if (i) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection or (ii) full payment of principal and interest is not expected. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received in excess of principal due. A loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured, which is typically evidenced by a sustained period (at least six months) of repayment performance by the borrower.

Modifications Provided to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty The Bank determines that a borrower may be experiencing financial difficulty if the borrower is currently delinquent on any of its debt, or if the Bank is concerned that the borrower may not be able to perform in accordance with the current terms of the loan agreement in the foreseeable future. Many aspects of the borrower s financial situation are assessed when determining whether they are experiencing financial difficulty, particularly as it relates to commercial borrowers due to the complex nature of the loan structure, business/industry risk and borrower/guarantor structures. Concessions may include the reduction of an interest rate at a rate lower than current market rates for a new loan with similar risk, extension of the maturity date, reduction of accrued interest, or principal forgiveness. When evaluating whether a concession has been granted, the Bank also considers whether the borrower has provided additional collateral or guarantors and whether such additions adequately compensate the Bank for the restructured terms, or if the revised terms are consistent with those currently being offered to new loan customers. The assessments of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the time a concession has been granted is subjective in nature and management s judgment is required when determining whether the concession results in a modification that is accounted for as a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan under U.S. GAAP. Although each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately, for all portfolio segments, loans modified as a result of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are typically modified through reduction in interest rates, reductions in payments, changing the payment terms from principal and interest to interest only, and/or extensions in term maturity. For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, loan from our residential 1-4 family loan portfolio on an amortized cost basis of million, was modified to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. This modification allowed a six month deferral of principal and interest of million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, with contractual payments expected to resume in August of this year. This loan, which has had no payment delinquencies since origination, represents only of total loans in the secured by first liens pool.

Allowance For Credit Losses Loans The allowance for credit losses on loans is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326 that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing collectability over the loans' contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. In calculating the allowance for credit losses, most loans are segmented into pools based upon similar characteristics and risk profiles. For allowance modeling purposes, our loan pools include but are not limited to (i) commercial real estate - owner occupied, (ii) commercial real estate - non-owner occupied, (iii) construction and land development, (iv) commercial, (v) agricultural loans, (vi) residential 1-4 family and (vii) consumer loans. We periodically reassess each pool to ensure the loans within the pool continue to share similar characteristics and risk profiles and to determine whether further segmentation is necessary. For each loan pool, we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of inputs: (i) probability of default, (ii) probability of attrition, (iii) loss given default and (iv) exposure at default. Internal data is supplemented by, but not replaced by, peer data when required, primarily to determine the probability of default input. The various pool-specific inputs may be adjusted for current macroeconomic assumptions. Significant macroeconomic variables utilized in our allowance models include, among other things, (i) VA Gross Domestic Product, (ii) VA House Price Index, and (iii) VA unemployment rates. Management qualitatively adjusts allowance model results for risk factors that are not considered within our quantitative modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. Qualitative factor Q-Factor adjustments are driven by key risk indicators that management tracks on a pool-by-pool basis.

Losses on installment loans are recognized in accordance with regulatory guidelines. All other consumer loan losses are recognized when delinquency exceeds 120 cumulative days.

Mortgage Banking Derivatives and Financial Instruments The Company enters into IRLCs interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, at specified interest rates and within a specified period of time (generally between 30 and 90 days), with borrowers who have applied for a loan and have met certain credit and underwriting criteria. The IRLCs are adjusted for estimated costs to originate the loan as well as the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC (the pullthrough rate). Estimated costs to originate include loan officer commissions and overrides. The pullthrough rate is estimated on changes in market conditions, loan stage, and actual borrower behavior using a historical analysis of IRLC closing rates. The Company obtains an analysis from a third party on a monthly basis to support the reasonableness of the pullthrough estimate. Best efforts and mandatory forward loan sale commitments are commitments to sell individual mortgage loans using both best efforts and mandatory delivery at a fixed price to an investor at a future date. Forward loan sale commitments that are mandatory delivery are accounted for as derivatives and carried at fair value, determined as the amount that would be necessary to settle the derivative financial instrument at the balance sheet date. Forward loan sale commitments that are best efforts are not derivatives but can be and have been accounted for at fair value, determined in a similar manner to those that are mandatory delivery. Forward loan sale commitments are recorded on the balance sheet as derivative assets and derivative liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded in mortgage banking income in the statement of operations.

The Company manages this credit risk by selecting only counterparties that the Company believes to be financially strong, spreading the risk among multiple counterparties, by placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit extended to any single counterparty and by entering into netting agreements with counterparties, as appropriate.

Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is based on the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, we do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk. Allowance For Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. Off-balance-sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit detailed above. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance-sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are based on historical utilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. Estimating credit losses on amounts expected to be funded uses the same methodology as described for loans in Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, as if such commitments were funded. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is reflected in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The following table details activity in the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures: Credit loss expense Balance as of March 31, Commitments Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments are made predominately for adjustable rate loans, and generally have fixed expiration dates of up to three months or other termination clauses and usually require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. We had million of loan commitments outstanding as of March 31, 2023, all of which contractually expire within .

 Current Economic Envir onment The U.S. economy expanded in the first quarter of 2023, with Real Gross Domestic Product growing by an annualized 1.1 . According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the rate of unemployment dropped to 3.5 in March 2023. The Federal Reserve (the Fed has raised rates 500 bps since March of 2022 in an effort to temper inflation, a pace that has not been experienced in more than 40 years and now sits at a level not seen since 2006. This rate level is putting strong upward pressure on all banks including Primis cost of deposits as banks look for ways to increase liquidity. Inflation remains higher than the Fed s long term target rate of 2 , and weakness in some areas of the economy and turmoil in the banking system has heightened recessionary concerns.

 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Revised and Restated) Net income of 8.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, or 0.34 basic and diluted earnings per share, compared to 4.5 million, or 0.18 basic and diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Total assets as of March 31, 2023 were 4.2 billion, an increase of 18 compared to December 31, 2022. Total cash and cash equivalents grew to 607.1 million, up from 77.9 million at December 31, 2022. Total loans, excluding Paycheck Protection Program PPP balances as of March 31, 2023, were 3.1 billion, an increase of 111 million, or 3.78 , from December 31, 2022. Total deposits were 3.7 billion at March 31, 2023, an increase of 35 compared to December 31, 2022. Non-time deposits increased to 3.2 billion at March 31, 2023, an increase of 912.2 million, or 40 , compared to December 31, 2022. The ratio of gross loans to deposits has declined to 82 at March 31, 2023, from 108 at December 31, 2022. Net interest margin of 2.81 in the first quarter of 2023 was down from 2.96 in the first quarter of 2022. Allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.17 at March 31, 2023, compared to 1.17 at December 31, 2022. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Revised and Restated) Net Income Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was 8.4 million, or 0.34 basic and diluted earnings per share, compared to 4.5 million, or 0.18 basic and diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The 85 increase in net income during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was driven by Consumer Program derivative income, higher mortgage banking income, and an increase in net interest income in the first quarter of 2023. These increases were partially offset by higher noninterest expenses mainly from an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense in the first quarter of 2023 related to increased head count at the Bank, Primis Mortgage and Panacea and higher provision for credit losses. Net Interest Income Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income was 25.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 22.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Primis net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was 2.81 , compared to 2.96 for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Net interest margin was significantly impacted by the successful launch of the Bank s digital deposit platform along with increased competition in the Company s core banking markets which increased the cost of deposits in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. Total income on interest-earning assets was 44.3 million and 26.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The yield on average interest-earning assets was 4.92 and 3.44 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Increase in yield on average interest-earnings assets was driven by higher rates on cash and loans in the first quarter of 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities was 2.9 billion compared to 2.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The cost of average interest-bearing deposits increased 188 basis points to 2.32 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 0.44 cost on average interest-bearing deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2022. This increase was driven by the benchmark interest rate increases which in turn drove the increase in interest-bearing deposit pricing. Average rates on our interest-bearing deposits increased in all categories but the largest increases were seen in money market, savings, and time deposits which also had an aggregate increase in average balances of 523 million year-over-year. This was a primary driven in the interest rate spread decreasing to 2.28 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from 2.80 for the three months ended March 31, 2022.

 Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses is a current charge to earnings made in order to adjust the allowance for credit losses to an appropriate level for current expected losses in the loan portfolio based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of lending, historical loan experience and other known internal and external factors affecting loan collectability. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated by segmenting the loan portfolio by loan type and applying risk factors to each segment. The risk factors are determined by considering historical loss data, peer data, as well as applying management s judgment. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 of 5.3 million and 0.1 million, respectively. Of this provision in the first quarter of 2023, 4.8 million was due to charge-offs and additional reserve calculated in our normal reserve process related to the Consumer Program loans. Excluding this provision amount, the provision for credit losses would have been 0.5 million at March 31, 2023. We had charge-offs totaling 4.4 million and 0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Charge-offs

 related to the Consumer Program loans were 2.0 million and 100 thousand during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were recoveries totaling 0.4 million and 0.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Financial Condition Section of this MD A provides information on our loan portfolio, past due loans, nonperforming assets and the allowance for credit losses. Noninterest Income The following table presents the major categories of noninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022: 

For the Three Months Ended March 31, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Account maintenance and deposit service fees 1,224 1,351 (127) Income from bank-owned life insurance 420 375 45 (Loss) gain on other investments (39) 195 (234) Mortgage banking income 4,315 4,315 Gain on sale of loans 51 51 Consumer Program derivative 11,443 54 11,389 Other noninterest income 256 170 86 Total noninterest income 17,670 2,145 15,525 Noninterest income increased 724 to 17.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in noninterest income was primarily related to 11.4 million of income on the Consumer Program derivative and 4.3 million of mortgage banking income in the first quarter of 2023. The Consumer Program derivative income was comprised of 10.5 million of fair value adjustment gains and 0.9 million of income related to credit loss reimbursements from the derivative counterparty under the Consumer Program agreement. The increase in mortgage banking income was a result of our purchase of Primis Mortgage in May 2022 and the normal mortgage activities now reflected in our income statement during the first quarter of 2023, which included the fair value adjustments and gains on sales of mortgage loans held for sale.

 Noninterest Expense The following table presents the major categories of noninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:

The 41 increase in noninterest expenses was primarily due to a 5.4 million increase in employee compensation in the first quarter of 2023 related to increased head count at the Bank, Primis Mortgage and Panacea compared to 2022. The increase in noninterest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was also attributable to a 0.8 million increase in data processing expense driven by substantially higher application volume on the digital deposit platform as a result of a savings account rate promotion offered during the quarter. A significant driver of the increase in other operating expenses were higher expenses related to Primis Mortgage in the first quarter of 2023. Other notable drivers of the increase in other operating expenses in the quarter include higher FDIC insurance costs and increased fraud losses, primarily driven by increased check fraud activity. Increases in noninterest expense were offset by a decline in professional fees due to expenses associated with bringing certain V1BE activities in-house in the first quarter of 2022.

Asset Quality While the impact of COVID-19 largely subsided in the first quarter of 2023, the residual effect of COVID-19 and its variants, as well as new risks emerging from geopolitical conflict, inflation, bank failures and the threat of a recession continue to cause economic instability and impacts our ability to evaluate our asset quality. Despite this economic uncertainty, our asset quality remained strong during the first quarter of 2023. We will generally place a loan on nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days past due. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status in cases where we are uncertain whether the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Cash payments received while a loan is categorized as nonaccrual will be recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to future collections. We maintain appraisals on loans secured by real estate, particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans. In instances where appraisals reflect reduced collateral values, we make an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition to determine the need, if any, for impairment or write-down to their fair values. If foreclosure occurs, we record OREO at the lower of our recorded investment in the loan or fair value less our estimated costs to sell. Our loan portfolio losses and delinquencies have been primarily limited by our underwriting standards and portfolio management practices. Whether losses and delinquencies in our portfolio will increase significantly depends upon the value of the real estate securing the loans and economic factors, such as the overall economy in our market area, rising interest rates, historically high inflation, global supply chain issues and potential recession. Total calculated reserves increased by 1.3 million to 35.8 million at the end of March 31, 2023 compared to 34.5 million at December 31, 2022, primarily due to the 109.2 million in total loan growth experienced in the first quarter of 2023. The following table presents a comparison of nonperforming assets as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands): 

March 31, December 31, 2023 2022 Nonaccrual loans 33,397 35,484 Loans past due 90 days and accruing interest 1,625 3,361 Total nonperforming assets 35,022 38,845 SBA guaranteed amounts included in nonperforming loans 2,206 3,969 Allowance for credit losses to total loans 1.17 1.17 Allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 107.20 97.35 Allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans 102.23 88.93 Nonaccrual to total loans 1.10 1.20 Nonperforming assets excluding SBA guaranteed loans to total assets 0.78 0.98

 Nonaccrual loans were 33.4 million (excluding 0.6 million of loans fully covered by SBA guarantees) at March 31, 2023, compared to 35.5 million (excluding 0.6 million of loans fully covered by SBA guarantees) at December 31, 2022, a decrease of 6 . A substantial portion of the Bank s nonperforming assets are comprised of two relationships with a combined balance of approximately 27.0 million. A large residential property with a balance of approximately 8.0 million included in that total, continues to make sporadic payments and is current as of March 31, 2023. The other relationship, primarily consisting of assisted living facilities, is currently in the middle of a receiver-managed marketing process. At March 31, 2023, our total substandard loans were 39.5 million. Included in the total substandard loans were SBA guarantees of 0.8 million. Special mention loans totaled 28.3 million at March 31, 2023. At December 31, 2022, our total substandard loans was 41.0 million. Included in the total substandard loans were SBA guarantees of 0.8 million. Special mention loans totaled 32.3 million at December 31, 2022. For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, one loan from our residential 1-4 family loan portfolio on an amortized cost basis of 0.9 million, was modified to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. This modification allowed a six month deferral of principal and interest of 0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, with contractual payments expected to resume in August of this year. This loan, which has had no payment delinquencies since origination, represents only 0.15 of total loans in the secured by first liens pool.

 Investment Securities Our investment securities portfolio provides us with required liquidity and investment securities to pledge as collateral to secure public deposits, certain other deposits, advances from the FHLB of Atlanta, and repurchase agreements. We classify our investment securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Debt investment securities that Primis has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are those debt securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs or other similar factors. Investment securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses net of deferred taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. Investment securities, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, totaled 244.6 million at March 31, 2023, a decrease of 2 from 249.8 million at December 31, 2022. The following table sets forth a summary of the investment securities portfolio as of the dates indicated. Available-for-sale investment securities are reported at fair value, and held-to-maturity investment securities are reported at amortized cost (in thousands). 

March 31, December 31, 2023 2022 Available-for-sale investment securities: Residential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities 101,917 102,881 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 30,000 29,178 Corporate securities 14,078 14,828 Collateralized loan obligations 4,891 4,876 Residential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations 25,635 26,595 Government-sponsored agency securities 15,100 14,616 Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 34,597 37,417 SBA pool securities 5,250 5,924 Total 231,468 236,315 Held-to-maturity investment securities: Residential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities 10,146 10,522 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 2,722 2,721 Residential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations 247 277 Total 13,115 13,520 We recognized an immaterial amount of credit impairment charges related to credit losses on our held-to-maturity investment securities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and no credit losses during the three months ended March 31, 2022. Deposits and Other Borrowings Deposits The market for deposits is competitive. We offer a line of traditional deposit products that currently include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking (or NOW accounts), commercial checking, money market accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit. We compete for deposits through our banking branches with competitive pricing, advertising and online banking. We use deposits as a principal source of funding for our lending, purchasing of investment securities and for other business purposes. Total deposits increased 35 to 3.7 billion at March 31, 2023 from 2.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in deposits from year-end was primarily driven by the substantial growth in the Bank s new digital deposit platform in the 

 50 

Table of Contents 
 first quarter of 2023. The majority of the growth was in savings accounts with the remainder largely in NOW accounts. Savings accounts increased 295 from 245.8 million as of December 31, 2022 to 971.5 million at March 31, 2023. NOW accounts increased 35 from 617.7 million at December 31, 2022 to 835.3 million at March 31, 2023. Our deposits are diversified in type and by underlying customer and lack significant concentrations to any type of customer (i.e. commercial, consumer, government) or industry. Uninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit account that are classified as deposits and are not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes. Total uninsured deposits as calculated per regulatory guidance were 1.1 billion, or 31 of total deposits at March 31, 2023. Included in this amount are affiliate balances and collateralized deposits of public entities and state and local government agencies; adjusting for these categories, our uninsured and uncollateralized deposits are approximately 26 of our total deposits at March 31, 2023. The variety of deposit accounts we offer allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and in responding to the threat of disintermediation (the flow of funds away from depository institutions such as banking institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities). Our ability to attract and maintain deposits, and the effect of such retention on our cost of funds, has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by the general economy and market rates of interest. For our deposit agreements with certain customers, we hold the collateral in a segregated custodial account. We are required to maintain adequate collateral levels. In the event the collateral fair value falls below stipulated levels, we will pledge additional securities. We closely monitor collateral levels to ensure adequate levels are maintained, while mitigating the potential risk of over-collateralization. Other Borrowings We use other borrowed funds to support our liquidity needs and to temporarily satisfy our funding needs from increased loan demand and for other shorter term purposes. We are a member of the FHLB and are authorized to obtain advances from the FHLB from time to time as needed. The FHLB has a credit program for members with different maturities and interest rates, which may be fixed or variable. We are required to collateralize our borrowings from the FHLB with purchases of FHLB stock and other collateral acceptable to the FHLB. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, total FHLB borrowings were 0 and 325.0 million, respectively. The decrease in FHLB borrowings was a result of the deposit growth during the first quarter of 2023 that primarily funded our loan growth and supported other funding needs and allowing us to repay our FHLB advances. As of March 31, 2023, we had 541.6 million of unused and available FHLB lines of credit. Other borrowings can consist of federal funds purchased, secured borrowings due to failed loan sales, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repo that mature within one year, which are secured transactions with customers. The balance in repo accounts was 4.3 million and 6.4 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We had secured borrowings of 15.0 million as of March 31, 2023 related to loan transfers to another financial institution during the three months ended March 31, 2023 that did not meet the criteria to be treated as a sale under relevant accounting guidance. These borrowings reflect the cash received for transferring the loans to the other financial institution and any unamortized sale premium and are secured by approximately the same amount of loans held for investment that are recorded in our balance sheet. We retained the servicing of the loans that were transferred and accordingly receive principal and interest from the borrower as contractually required and transfer the interest to the other financial institution net of our contractually agreed upon servicing fee. The loans transferred have an average maturity of approximately ten years which will be the time over which the principal balance of the loans in our balance sheet and secured borrowings will pay down, absent borrower prepayments. For additional information on secured borrowings refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies in this Form 10-Q/A.

 Liquidity and Funds Management The objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the ability to meet our financial obligations. These obligations include the payment of deposits on demand or at maturity, the repayment of borrowings at maturity and the ability to fund commitments and other new business opportunities. We obtain funding from a variety of sources, including customer deposit accounts, customer certificates of deposit and payments on our loans and investments. If our level of core deposits are not sufficient to fully fund our lending activities, we have access to funding from additional sources, including but not limited to borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and institutional certificates of deposits. In addition, we maintain federal funds lines of credit with two correspondent banks, totaling 65 million, and utilize securities sold under agreements to repurchase repo and reverse repurchase agreement borrowings from approved securities dealers, as needed. We prepare a cash flow forecast on a 30, 60 and 90 day basis along with a one and two year basis. These projections incorporate expected cash flows on loans, investment securities, and deposits based on data used to prepare our interest rate risk analyses. At March 31, 2023, we had substantial liquidity on the balance sheet with cash and equivalents of 607 million versus 78 million at December 31, 2022 largely due to the growth in digital platform deposits described above. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had pledged callable agency securities, residential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations with a carrying value of 13.9 million and 14.2 million, respectively, to customers who require collateral for overnight repurchase agreements and deposits. The balance in repo accounts at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was 4.3 million and 6.5 million, respectively. We repaid our short-term FHLB advances of 325.0 million that were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and matured in the first quarter of 2023. As a result, we have all of our FHLB capacity available for future liquidity needs. At March 31, 2023, Primis Bank had lendable collateral value in the form of residential 1-4 family mortgages, HELOCs, commercial mortgage loans, and investment securities supporting borrowing capacity of approximately 541.6 million from the FHLB. In March 2023, the Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program BTFP in response to recent industry disruption, offering loans with up to one year in maturity to eligible depository institutions in exchange for pledged collateral in the form of U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and other qualifying assets. Borrowing capacity under the BTFP is based on the par value, not fair value, of the collateral. At March 31, 2023, we had securities available of 165.0 million for utilization with the BTFP, with no borrowings outstanding under the program at March 31, 2023. The Bank also utilizes institutional and brokered certificates of deposit to supplement customer funding. At March 31, 2023, we had 100.0 million of brokered deposits outstanding. We had remaining brokered CD capacity under internal policy of approximately 321.0 million. At March 31, 2023, we had 526.3 million of unfunded lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan funds, not all of which will ultimately be drawn. The amount of certificate of deposit accounts maturing in less than one year was 380.3 million as of March 31, 2023, including 100.0 million of brokered CDs. Management anticipates that funding requirements for these commitments can be met in the normal course. As noted above, our uninsured and otherwise uncollateralized deposits were approximately 26 of total deposits, or 946.0 million. The combined availability under our various liquidity sources along with cash and equivalents on the balance sheet represented approximately 180 of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits at March 31, 2023.

 As of March 31, 2023, Primis was not aware of any known trends, events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our liquidity. As of March 31, 2023, Primis has no material commitments for capital expenditures. Capital Resources Capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations. Primis Financial Corp. and its subsidiary bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action PCA ), we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for PCA. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Primis to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined). Management believes, as of March 31, 2023, that Primis meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. The following table provides a comparison of the leverage and risk-weighted capital ratios of Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank at the periods indicated to the minimum and well-capitalized required regulatory standards: 

Minimum Required for Capital To Be Actual Ratio at Adequacy Categorized as March 31, December 31, Purposes Well Capitalized (1) 2023 2022 Primis Financial Corp. Leverage ratio 4.00 n/a 8.53 9.52 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 4.50 n/a 9.86 10.07 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 6.00 n/a 10.18 10.40 Total risk-based capital ratio 8.00 n/a 13.99 14.33 Primis Bank Leverage ratio 4.00 5.00 10.15 11.24 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 7.00 6.50 12.18 12.40 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 8.50 8.00 12.18 12.40 Total risk-based capital ratio 10.50 10.00 13.37 13.59 

 (1) Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable at the bank holding company level. 
 Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank are required to meet minimum capital requirements set forth by regulatory authorities. Bank regulatory agencies have approved regulatory capital guidelines Basel III aimed at strengthening existing capital requirements for banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules require Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , plus a 2.5 capital conservation buffer , (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 , plus the capital conservation buffer, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 , plus the capital conservation buffer and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions by regulators which could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank remain well-capitalized under Basel III capital requirements. Primis Bank had a capital conservation buffer of 5.37 at March 31, 2023, which exceeded the 2.50 minimum requirement below which the regulators may impose limits on distributions.

 Primis Bank s capital position is consistent with being well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for PCA. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Restated) The critical accounting policies are discussed in MD A in our restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022. Significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies in Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022. Disclosures regarding the effects of new accounting pronouncements are included in Note 1. Accounting Policies in this Form 10-Q/A. There have been no changes to the significant accounting policies during 2023. ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Revised and Restated) We are engaged primarily in the business of investing funds obtained from deposits and borrowings into interest-earning loans and investments. Consequently, our earnings depend to a significant extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income on loans and other investments and the interest expense on deposits and borrowings. To the extent that our interest-bearing liabilities do not reprice or mature at the same time as our interest-earning assets, we are subject to interest rate risk and corresponding fluctuations in net interest income. Our Asset-Liability Committee ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk. The policies established by the ALCO are reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors. We have employed asset/liability management policies that seek to manage our net interest income, without having to incur unacceptable levels of credit or investment risk. We use simulation modeling to manage our interest rate risk, and review quarterly interest sensitivity. This approach uses a model which generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity EVE over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts using assumptions including estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates. The following tables are based on an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated change in EVE resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (plus 400 basis points or minus 100 basis points, measured in 100 basis point increments) as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. All changes are within our Asset/Liability Risk Management Policy guidelines.

NII depends upon the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them. In this regard, the model assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. All changes are within our ALM Policy guidelines at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Modeling changes in EVE and NII sensitivity requires the making of certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, although the EVE tables and NII tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net worth and NII. Sensitivity of EVE and NII are modeled using different assumptions and approaches.

 ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (Restated) (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d -15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) utilizing the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that these controls and procedures are not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. This conclusion was reached as a result of the continued remediation of previously identified material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting as further described in Item 9A in the restated 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A related to complex accounting arrangements and also due to the identification of an additional material weakness related to the transfer of certain loans to another financial institution during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Management identified the additional material weakness over the Company s internal controls over financial reporting for the three months ended March 31, 2023 related to accounting determinations for transfers of financial assets including lack of a formally designed process and procedure for evaluation of loan transfers. The existing procedures did not outline the process to be taken and individuals to be involved in assessment of the proper accounting for loan transfers and were not sufficient enough to facilitate a proper conclusion on loan transfer transactions. As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Amendment. The Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2023, at the reasonable assurance level, because of the material weakness in internal controls, which were disclosed in the Company's restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022 (with respect to the Consumer Program) and Current Report on Form 8-K on March 1, 2024 (with respect to the loan transfers). Notwithstanding the material weaknesses, the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in the Form 10-Q/A, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, fairly present, in all material respects, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash-flows for the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Remediation Plans (i) Complex accounting arrangements 
 Management continues to review and make changes to the overall design of its internal control environment, including implementing additional internal controls over the identification of complex agreements the Company enters into and ensuring the appropriate level of review of these agreements by an individual with the requisite accounting expertise. The Company is adding additional internal controls to its financial close and reporting process to enhance the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting to require appropriate levels of accounting management review of new transactions. Additionally, the Company will seek appropriate third-party accounting expertise when it determines a transaction contains complex arrangements that management does not have sufficient expertise to assess and conclude upon. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period. The Company has made progress in the remediation efforts related to the material weakness and anticipates the control weakness to be remediated as soon as possible.

 (ii) Loan transfers Management continues to review and make changes to the overall design of its internal control environment, including implementing additional internal controls over the identification of loan transfer transactions and management review of the transactions. The Company has added additional internal controls to its financial close and reporting process to enhance the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period. The Company has made progress in the remediation efforts related to the material weakness and anticipates the control weakness to be remediated as soon as possible. The Company s remediation efforts include: created a specific control in its quarterly financial close process to facilitate the identification of loan transfers and trigger an accounting review; created a process to assess loan transfers in accordance with applicable accounting guidance; established procedures to enable the accounting assessment in accordance with U.S. GAAP; and developed criteria that facilitates the decision process for use of outside legal counsel to assist in evaluating the legal isolation requirement. 
 The Company s actions are subject to ongoing executive management review and are also subject to audit committee oversight. If the Company is unable to successfully remediate the material weakness, or if in the future, the Company identifies further material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not detect errors on a timely basis, and its condensed consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. Management may determine that additional measures are required to address control deficiencies, strengthen internal control over financial reporting, or it may determine to modify the remediation measures described above. (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . As a result of the acquisition of Primis Mortgage, the Company is continuously working to integrate Primis Mortgage into its internal control over financial reporting process. Except for the changes in connection with this integration of Primis Mortgage and the material weaknesses noted above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Primis and Primis Bank are from time to time a party, as both plaintiff and defendant, to various claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of the Bank s business, including administrative and/or legal proceedings that may include employment-related claims, as well as claims of lender liability, breach of contract, and other similar lending-related claims. While the ultimate resolution of these matters cannot be determined at this time, the Bank s management presently believes that such matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Bank s financial condition or results of operations. There are no proceedings pending, or to management s knowledge, threatened, that represent a significant risk against Primis or Primis Bank as of March 31, 2023. ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS (Restated) There were no changes to the risk factors that were previously disclosed in our restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for the addition of the item below. Recent negative developments in the banking industry could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations. The recent bank failures and related negative media attention have generated significant market trading volatility among publicly traded bank holding companies and, in particular, regional, as well as community banks like the Company.

 These developments have negatively impacted customer confidence in regional and community banks, which could prompt customers to maintain their deposits with larger financial institutions. Further, competition for deposits has increased in recent periods, and the cost of funding has similarly increased, putting pressure on our net interest margin. If we were required to sell a portion of our securities portfolio to address liquidity needs, we may incur losses, including as a result of the negative impact of rising interest rates on the value of our securities portfolio, which could negatively affect our earnings and our capital. If we were required to raise additional capital in the current environment, any such capital raise may be on unfavorable terms, thereby negatively impacting book value and profitability. While we have taken actions to improve our funding, there is no guarantee that such actions will be successful or sufficient in the event of sudden liquidity needs. We also anticipate increased regulatory scrutiny in the course of routine examinations and otherwise and new regulations directed towards banks of similar size to Primis Bank, designed to address the recent negative developments in the banking industry, all of which may increase our costs of doing business and reduce our profitability. Among other things, there may be an increased focus by both regulators and investors on deposit composition, the level of uninsured deposits, losses embedded in the held-to-maturity portion of our securities portfolio, contingent liquidity, CRE composition and concentration, capital position and our general oversight and internal control structures regarding the foregoing. As a result, Primis Bank could face increased scrutiny or be viewed as higher risk by regulators and the investor community.
