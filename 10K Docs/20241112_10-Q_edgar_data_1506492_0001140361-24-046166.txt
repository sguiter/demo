million and it expects to incur losses for the immediate future. To date, the Company has been funded by equity financings, and although the Company believes that
 it will be able to successfully fund its operations, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so or that it will ever operate profitably. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
 concern through the next twelve months. The Company became a revenue-generating company after acquiring the Aquadex Business in August 2016. The Company expects to incur additional losses in the near-term as it grows the Aquadex
 Business, including investments in its sales and marketing capabilities, product development, purchasing inventory, manufacturing components, generating additional clinical evidence supporting the
 efficacy of the Aquadex System, and complying with the requirements related to being a U.S. public company. To become and remain profitable, the Company must succeed in expanding the adoption and market acceptance of the Aquadex
 System. This will require the Company to succeed in training personnel at hospitals and in outpatient care settings, and effectively and efficiently manufacturing, marketing, and distributing the Aquadex System and related components. There can
 be no assurance that the Company will succeed in these activities, and it may never generate revenues sufficient to achieve profitability.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). Our most significant accounting policies are
 disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and
 accompanying notes. Our estimates and assumptions, including those related to stock-based compensation, valuation of equity and debt securities, and income tax reserves are updated as appropriate, which in most cases is quarterly. We base our
 estimates on historical experience, valuations, or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided
 in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Revenue Recognition : We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Accordingly,

we recognize revenue when our customers obtain control of their products or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods and services. See Note 2 Revenue Recognition, included in
 Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for additional disclosures.

Accounts Receivable : Our accounts receivables generally have terms that require payment within 30 days. We did not establish an allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024, as we have not
 incurred any write-offs or experienced a deterioration in the aging of our receivables, and we do not expect to experience write-offs in the future. The Company provides reserves against accounts receivable for estimated credit losses that may
 result from a customer s inability to pay based on a combination of factors, such as the aging of accounts receivable, the customer s financial strength and payment history. To date there the Company has not experienced any write offs.

Inventories : Inventories consist of finished goods, raw materials and subassemblies and are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method.

Stock-Based Compensation: We recognize all share-based payments to employees, directors, and consultants, including grants of stock options and common stock awards, in the consolidated statement of
 operations and comprehensive loss as an operating expense based on their fair values as established at the grant date. Other equity instruments issued to non-employees consist of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. These warrants are
 either fully vested and exercisable at the date of grant or vest over a certain period during which services are provided.

We compute the estimated fair values of stock options and warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and market-based warrants using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Market price at the date of grant is used to calculate the fair
 value of any restricted stock units and common stock awards.

20 

Table of Contents 

We expense the fair market value of fully vested awards at the time of grant, and of unvested awards over the period in which the related services are received. Stock-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest
 and is reduced for estimated forfeitures, except for market-based warrants, which are expensed based on the grant date fair value regardless of whether the award vests. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
 subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

Accounting for Warrants: We have issued and may continue to issue warrants to purchase shares of common stock through our public and private offerings and in conjunction with the Supply Agreement
 executed with DaVita in June 2023. We account for such warrants in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , which identifies three categories of freestanding financial instruments
 that are required to be accounted for as a liability. If determined to be classified as a liability, we will remeasure the fair value of the warrants at each balance sheet date. If determined to be classified as equity, the fair value of the
 warrants will be measured as of the date of issuance and will not be subject to remeasurement at each subsequent balance sheet date.

The fair value of the warrant liability is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model using relevant inputs and assumptions based upon the terms of the warrants.

Loss per Share: Basic loss per share is computed based on the net loss for each period divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. See Note 3 Stockholders Equity below for
 additional disclosures.

Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the net loss allocable to common stockholders for each period divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, increased by the number of additional shares that would have
 been outstanding had the potentially dilutive common shares been issued, and reduced by the number of shares the Company could have repurchased from the proceeds from issuance of the potentially dilutive shares. Potentially dilutive shares of
 common stock include shares underlying outstanding convertible preferred stock, warrants, stock options and other stock-based awards granted under stock-based compensation plans.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be
 recoverable. If the impairment tests indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by such asset or asset group, further analysis is performed to determine the
 fair value of the asset or asset group. To the extent the fair value of the asset or asset group is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount the fair value of the asset or asset group is exceeded by its
 carrying amount. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of assets or asset groups, and accordingly,
 actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.

The Company continues to report operating losses and negative cash flows from operations, both of which it considers to be indicators of potential impairment. Therefore, the Company evaluates its long-lived assets for potential impairment at
 each reporting period. The Company has concluded that its cash flows from the various long-lived assets are highly interrelated and, as a result, the Company consists of a single asset group. As the Company expects to continue incurring losses in
 the foreseeable future, the undiscounted cash flow step was bypassed, and the Company proceeded to measure fair value of the asset group. The Company has determined the fair value of the asset group associated with its loaner units by using
 expected cash flows estimating future discounted cash flows expected from the rental of these units. For recently acquired assets within the asset group, primarily equipment, the Company determined the fair value based on the replacement cost.
 There have been no impairment losses recognized for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023.

Going Concern: Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented on a basis assuming we continue as a going concern. During the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, and through
 September 30, 2024, we incurred losses from operations and net cash outflows from operating activities as disclosed in the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, respectively. Since the company s inception and as of September 30,
 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 297.3 million, and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. To date, we have been funded by debt and equity financings, and although we believe that we will be able to successfully fund our
 operations into the future, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that we will ever operate profitably. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern through at least twelve
 months from the report date.

We became a revenue-generating company after acquiring the Aquadex Business in August 2016. We expect to incur additional losses in the near-term as we grow the Aquadex Business, including investments in our sales and marketing capabilities,
 product development, purchasing inventory and manufacturing components, generating additional clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of the Aquadex System, and complying with the requirements related to being a U.S. public company. To become
 and remain profitable, we must succeed in expanding the adoption and market acceptance of the Aquadex System. This will require us to succeed in training personnel at hospitals and effectively and efficiently manufacturing, marketing, and
 distributing the Aquadex System and related components. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in these activities, and we may never generate revenues sufficient to achieve profitability.

Understanding the near-term need to raise capital, the Company has recently undertaken steps to reduce our monthly cash burn rate by approximately 40 , balanced against our strategic growth initiatives, which will provide more flexibility in
 anticipation of tougher capital market conditions for microcap companies like Nuwellis. These reductions include, but are not limited to the following: selected job eliminations, a reduction of the salaries for members of senior management, no
 merit increases to the base salaries of any named executive officer or employee in 2024 for performance provided during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, no cash bonuses to any named executive officer or employee in 2024 for performance
 provided during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, a reduction in Board of Director and committee fees, temporary suspension of Company 401k match, travel reductions, and reductions to select professional services. The Board recently
 reauthorized the Company 401k match effective as of October 1, 2024.

On November 5, 2024, the Company announced the entry into definitive agreements for the immediate exercise of certain outstanding warrants issued by the Company on April 30, 2024 (collectively, the Existing Warrants to purchase up to an
 aggregate of 1,832,517 shares of the Company s common stock at their current exercise price of 2.10 per share for total gross proceeds of approximately 3.8 million, prior to deducting inducement agent fees and estimated offering expenses. An
 additional 1.3 million of gross proceeds was received through the exercise of warrants over the last week in accordance with their original terms. In consideration for the immediate exercise of the Existing Warrants, the Company will issue
 Series I common stock purchase warrants (the Series I Warrants and Series II common stock purchase warrants (the Series II Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,665,034 shares of common stock. The Series I Warrants will have an
 exercise price of 1.94, will be exercisable six (6) months from the date of issuance, and will have a term of five (5) years from the date of exercisability. The Series II Warrants will have an exercise price of 1.94, will be exercisable six
 (6) months from the date of issuance, and will have a term of two (2) years from the date of exercisability. The Series I Warrants and Series II Warrants are fixed priced and do not contain any variable pricing features. The Series I Warrants and
 Series II Warrants described above were offered in a private placement pursuant to an applicable exemption from the registration requirements under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act ), and, along with the shares
 of common stock issuable upon their exercise, have not been registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC or an applicable
 exemption from such registration requirements. The securities were offered only to accredited investors. The Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise
 of the Series I Warrants and Series II Warrants.

We believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to support our operating plan through May 31, 2025; however, there can be no assurance of this. We will likely seek to raise additional capital to support our growth or other
 strategic initiatives through debt, equity, or a combination thereof. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in raising additional capital. .

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The Company has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued and their potential effects on its financial statements. The Company's management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a
 material effect on the Company's condensed financial statements.

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW

We are a medical device company focused on commercializing the Aquadex System for ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy. Activities since inception
 have consisted principally of raising capital, performing research and development, and conducting pre-clinical and clinical studies. During 2016, we acquired the Aquadex Business and announced that we were halting all clinical evaluations of our
 prior technology, the C-Pulse System. Since then, our activities have consisted mainly of expanding our sales and marketing capabilities, performing clinical research, and engaging in new product development. Since the company s inception and as
 of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 297.3 million, and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. To date, we have been funded by public and private equity financings and debt. Although we believe that we will be
 able to continue to successfully fund our operations, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that we will ever operate profitably.

Revenue is generated mainly from the sale of disposable blood filters and catheters used in conjunction with the Aquadex System consoles. We sell primarily in the United States to hospitals and clinics through our direct salesforce. We sell
 outside of the United States to independent specialty distributors, who in turn sell to hospitals and clinics in their geographic regions. The decrease in sales in the current year period is due to a decrease in circuit and console sales offset
 by a one-time increase in SeaStar Medical Quelimmune sales in the current year quarter.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

We have funded our operations primarily through cash on hand and a series of equity issuances.

I n March 2023, the Company filed a Prospectus Supplement to its Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the SEC in connection with a proposed At-the-Market Securities offering (the At-the-Market Program ).
 During 2023, the Company issued 18,781 shares of common stock under the At-the-Market Program for gross proceeds of approximately 2.3 million. Net proceeds totaled approximately 2.1 million after deducting the underwriting discounts
 and commissions and other costs associated with the offering. The Company terminated its At-the-Market Program in July of 2024.

On October 17, 2023, the Company closed on a public offering of 4,286 Units, with each Unit consisting of one share of the Company s Series J Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value 0.0001 per share,
 with a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share (the Series J Convertible Preferred Stock ), and one October 2023 Warrant to purchase one-half of one (0.50) share of Series J Convertible Preferred Stock.

The purchase price for one Unit was 15.00, which reflects the issuance of the Series J Convertible Preferred Stock with an original issue discount. The Series J Convertible Preferred Stock has a term of three (3)
 years and is convertible at the option of the holder at any time into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of 1.01.

If any shares of our Series J Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding at the end of the three-year term, then the Company will promptly redeem all of such outstanding shares of Series J Convertible Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis among all of the holders of Series J Convertible Preferred Stock commencing on the Mandatory Redemption Date in cash, to the extent legally permissible under Delaware law, or, if redemption for
 cash is not legally permissible in duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company s common stock equal in number to the quotient obtained by dividing such unpaid amount by the closing price of the Company s
 common stock on the Nasdaq on the Mandatory Redemption Date.

Dividends on the Series J Convertible Preferred Stock will be paid, if and when declared by the Company s board of directors, in-kind PIK dividends in additional shares of Series J Convertible Preferred Stock
 based on the stated value of 25.00 per share at a dividend rate of 5.0 . The PIK dividends will be paid on a quarterly basis for three (3) years following the closing date to holders of the Series J Convertible Preferred Stock of record at the
 close of business on October 31, January 31, April 30, and July 31 of each year.

The October 2023 Warrants have a term of three (3) years. Each October 2023 Warrant has an exercise price of 262.50 (50.0 of the public offering price per Unit) per one-half of one share (0.5) of Series J
 Convertible Preferred Stock and is immediately exercisable.

24 

Table of Contents 

The gross proceeds before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, were approximately 2.25 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and for general corporate purposes.

On April 30, 2024, the Company closed on an underwritten public offering of 321,417 shares of its common stock (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 482,146 shares
 of its common stock at a combined public offering price 0.24 per share (or pre-funded warrant in lieu thereof) and associated warrant. Each share of common stock (or prefunded warrant in lieu thereof) was sold together with one warrant to
 purchase one and a half shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of 14.00 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance, and will expire five years following the date of issuance. Each whole common warrant entitles the
 holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock.

The common warrants contain a reset of the exercise price, to a price equal to the lesser of (i) the then exercise price, (ii) the lowest volume weighted average price for the five trading days immediately
 following the date we effect a reverse stock split in the future and (iii) if we effect a reverse stock split prior to obtaining the Warrant Stockholder Approval, the lowest volume weighted average price for the five trading days immediately
 following the date we obtain the Warrant Stockholder Approval. The Company secured the Warrant Stockholder Approval on June 6, 2024. Upon such a reset, there will be a proportionate adjustment to the number o f shares underlying the common warrants. In addition, the common warrants will provide for full ratchet anti-dilution adjustment to the exercise price and number of shares underlying the common warrants upon our issuance of our common
 stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share that is less than the exercise price of the common warrants, subject to certain exemptions. In no event will the exercise price of the common warrants with respect to either adjustment be
 reduced below a floor price of 0.06. 

The gross proceeds to the Company from the offering, before deducting the placement agent fees and other offering expenses were approximately 2.7 million.

On July 24, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement with certain
 institutional investors for the purchase and sale of 469,340 shares of the Company's common stock at a price of 4.24 per share of common stock in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules. 

In addition, in a concurrent private placement, the Company issued warrants to the investors to purchase up to 938,680 shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of 3.99
 per share, are exercisable immediately following the date of issuance and will have a term of five years from the date of issuance.

The closing of the registered direct offering and the concurrent private placement occurred on or about July 25, 2024.

The gross proceeds to Nuwellis from the registered direct offering and the concurrent private placement, before deducting the placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company, were
 approximately 2.0 million. Nuwellis intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and for general corporate purposes.

On August 23, 2024, the Company entered into a placement agency agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann Co. Inc. and a securities purchase agreement with certain purchasers pursuant to which the Company agreed to
 sell, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 483,351 shares of the Company s common stock, 0.0001 par value per share, at a purchase price of 1.8450 per Share and accompanying Common Warrant.

 and Exchange Commission (the SEC on July 1, 2024, and was declared effective by the SEC on July 9, 2024, and a related prospectus supplement, dated August 23, 2024, related to the Registered Offering.

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, in a concurrent private placement the Company also agreed to sell and issue to the Purchasers, warrants to purchase up to 483,351 shares of Common Stock. The Common Warrants

The gross proceeds of the Offering, before deducting the Placement Agent s fees and expenses and other offering expenses payable by the Company and excluding the net proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the Common Warrants or Placement Agent
 Warrants, were approximately 892,000. The Offering closed on August 26, 2024. The Company also issued to the Placement Agent, or its designees, warrants to purchase up to 14,501 shares of our Common Stock as part of the compensation payable to
 the Placement Agent in connection with this offering. The Placement Agent Warrants are not registered pursuant to the prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. The Placement Agent Warrants have substantially the same terms as the
 Common Warrants described above, except that the Placement Agent Warrants will have an exercise price of 3.04425 per share and will expire August 23, 2029.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were 1.9 million and 3.8 million, respectively. Our business strategy and ability to fund our operations in the future depend in part on our ability to grow the
 Aquadex Business by expanding our salesforce, selling our products to hospitals and other healthcare facilities, and controlling costs. We will need to seek additional financing in the future, which, to date, has been primarily through offerings
 of our equity securities.

Cash Flows used in Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities was 8.1 million and 15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The net cash used in each of these periods primarily reflects the net loss for those
 periods, partially offset by non-cash charges for stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, and revaluation of the warrant liability, and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities, including working capital.

Cash Flows provided by (used in) Investing Activities

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was 37,000) and 294,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The cash used in investing activities was for legal costs related to new patent applications
 in the prior year and for the purchase of manufacturing, laboratory, and office equipment, respectively, in those periods.

Cash Flows provided by Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was 6.2 million and 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The cash provided by financing activities in the current year period was the result of proceeds
 received from the April 2024, July 2024, and August 2024 financings and from the exercise of warrants from the October 2023 and April 2024 financings. The cash provided by financing activities in the prior year period was the result of proceeds
 received from our 2023 At-The-Market program.

Capital Resource Requirements

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures.

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
 of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), that are based on management s beliefs, assumptions and expectations and information currently available to management. All statements that address future operating performance, events or developments that
 we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward-looking statements, including without limitation, business development, and employees, our ability to execute on our strategic
 realignments, our post-market clinical data collection activities, benefits of our products to patients, our expectations with respect to product development and commercialization efforts, our ability to increase market and physician acceptance
 of our products, potentially competitive product offerings, the possibility that we may be unable to raise sufficient funds necessary for our anticipated operations, intellectual property protection, and other risks and uncertainties described in
 our filings with the SEC. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, ongoing, plan, potential, predict, 
 project, should, will, would or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and
 when made. However, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they speak only as of the date when made. We undertake no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or
 circumstances that might subsequently arise. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events to adversely differ from the expectations indicated in these forward-looking statements,
 including without limitation, the risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, in other reports filed thereafter with the SEC, which risk factors may by updated from time to
 time, and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. We operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risk
 factors and uncertainties. We may not actually achieve the plans, projections or expectations disclosed in forward-looking statements, and actual results, developments or events could differ materially from those disclosed in the forward-looking
 statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation, the possibility that regulatory authorities do not accept our application or approve the marketing of our products, the
 possibility we may be unable to raise the funds necessary for the development and commercialization of our products, and those described in our filings with the SEC.

ITEM 4.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules
 and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), as appropriate to allow for timely decisions
 regarding required disclosure.

In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired
 objectives. Also, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
 evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
 judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be
 no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

As of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Certifying Officers, of the effectiveness of the design and
 operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives. Based
 on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. The Certifying Officers based their
 conclusion on the fact that the Company has identified two material weaknesses in controls over financial reporting, as detailed in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In light of this fact, management expects to perform additional analyses,
 reconciliations, and remediations.

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. However, as a result of the identified material weaknesses, changes in our internal control over financial reporting will occur.

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties we describe in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other reports filed thereafter
 with the SEC, before deciding to invest in or retain shares of our common stock. Other than set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Risk Factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
 December 31, 2023. 

Risk Related to our Common Stock

Nasdaq may delist our common stock from its exchange which could limit your ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.

27 

Table of Contents 

Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol NUWE . In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements including, without limitation,
 the minimum stockholders equity requirement and the minimum bid price requirement. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining, or if we fall out of compliance, in regaining compliance with the continued listing
 requirements and maintaining the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market. On December 7, 2023, we received a notice from Nasdaq (the Notice informing us that because the closing
 bid price for our Common Stock was below 1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq, as set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum
 Bid Price Requirement ). 

In accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were granted a period of 180 calendar days from December 7, 2023, or until June 4, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price
 Requirement. Subsequently, on May 23, 2024, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff informing the Company that it was not in compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on
 Nasdaq, under Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Stockholder s Equity Requirement ), because the Company s stockholders equity of 885,000, as reported in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024, was below
 the required minimum of 2.5 million, and because, as of May 23, 2024, the Company did not meet the alternative compliance standards, relating to the market value of listed securities of 35 million or net income from continuing operations of
 500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years. 

As a result, on June 5, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq indicating the Company s continued non-compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Letter ). The Letter further informed the Company
 that the Common Stock would be delisted from Nasdaq unless the Company appeals the Staff's delisting determination by requesting a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ). The Company's requested a hearing to request additional
 time to meet the Stockholder Equity Requirement which stayed any further delisting action by the Staff pending the ultimate outcome of the hearing. The Common Stock will remain listed and eligible for trading on Nasdaq at least pending the
 ultimate conclusion of the hearing process.

On June 27, 2024, we effected a 1-for-35 reverse stock split of our outstanding Common Stock. Additionally, in 2020, the SEC approved a Nasdaq rule change to expedite delisting of securities of companies that
 have had one or more reverse stock splits with a cumulative ratio of one for 250 or more shares over the prior two-year period. Under the new rules, if a company falls out of compliance with the 1.00 minimum bid price after completing reverse
 stock splits over the immediately preceding two years that cumulatively result in a ratio one for 250 shares, the company will not be able to avail itself of any compliance periods and Nasdaq will instead require the issuance of a Staff
 delisting determination, which is appealable to a hearings panel. Our ability to remain listed on Nasdaq may be negatively impacted by this Nasdaq rule.

On July 18, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Staff informing the Company that it had regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, but that because it was still non-compliant with the
 Stockholder s Equity Requirement the hearing would continue as scheduled as to the matter of the Stockholder s Equity Requirement.

On July 23, 2024, the Company addressed the Panel and presented its plan of compliance for the Stockholder s Equity Requirement.

On August 8, 2024, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that the Panel had granted the Company s request for continued listing, subject to, among other things, the Company s filing of its
 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2024, evidencing compliance with the Stockholder s Equity Requirement.

There can be no assurance the Panel will grant any request for continued listing or that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the applicable listing criteria within the period of time that may be
 granted by the Panel.

If our Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq, our ability to raise capital through public offerings of our securities and to finance our operations could be adversely affected. We also believe that delisting
 would likely result in decreased liquidity and/or increased volatility in our Common Stock and could harm our business and future prospects. In addition, we believe that, if our Common Stock is delisted, our stockholders would likely find it
 more difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of the Common Stock and it may be more difficult for stockholders to buy or sell our Common Stock at competitive market prices, or at all.

28 

Table of Contents 

If our Common Stock is delisted, our Common Stock would likely then trade only in the over-the-counter market. If our Common Stock were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our Common Stock could
 be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: a limited availability of market quotations for our
 securities; reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; a determination that our shares are a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in our securities to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of
 trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; a reduced amount of news and analyst coverage for us; and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. These factors could
 result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our Common Stock and would substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development
 opportunities for us.

In addition to the foregoing, if our Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq and it trades on the over-the-counter market, the application of the penny stock rules could adversely affect the market price of our
 Common Stock and increase the transaction costs to sell those shares. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a penny stock as an equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to specific
 exemptions. If our Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq and it trades on the over-the-counter market at a price of less than 5.00 per share, our Common Stock would be considered a penny stock. The SEC s penny stock rules require a
 broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer
 must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and the salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock
 held in the customer s account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that before a transaction in a penny stock occurs, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment
 for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s agreement to the transaction. If applicable in the future, these rules may restrict the ability of brokers-dealers to sell our Common Stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their
 shares, until our Common Stock no longer is considered a penny stock.

We continue to actively monitor our performance with respect to the listing standards and will consider available options to resolve any deficiency and maintain compliance with the Nasdaq rules. There

can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance or, if we fall out of compliance, regain compliance with any deficiency, or if we implement an option that regains our compliance, maintain
 compliance thereafter.

If we fail to comply with federal and state laws regarding off-label use of our products, we could face substantial civil and criminal penalties and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and
 prospects could be adversely affected. 

Healthcare professionals may choose to use and prescribe medical devices for uses that are not described in the product s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical trials and approved or authorized by the regulatory
 authorities. Medical device companies, however, are prohibited from marketing and promoting products for indications and uses that are not specifically approved or authorized by FDA. Such off-label uses are common on the medical world and often
 are appropriate treatments for some patients. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not restrict or regulate the treatment choices of healthcare professionals. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by companies
 concerning off-label uses of their products. Any FDA approval or marketing authorization that we have or may obtain in the future permits us to promote the subject medical device only for the specific use(s) cleared, approved, certified or
 otherwise authorized. We are prohibited from marketing or promoting any medical devices for off-label use. 

Notwithstanding the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, the FDA and other regulatory authorities allow companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional speech concerning their products. Accordingly, we engage in
 medical education activities and communicate with healthcare professionals about many aspects of our products and clinical trials. In addition, we are aware that the Aquadex System, which is cleared by FDA solely for use in adults and pediatric
 patients weighing 20 kg or more, is being used off-label uses to treat patients who weigh under 20 kg, including being modified by children s hospitals so that it can provide dialysis to neonates and other premature infants who were born either
 without kidneys or without normal kidney function. These patients typically have very few other treatment options given the large extracorporeal blood volume required by standard dialysis machines, the need for blood priming of the dialysis
 circuit and the use of large catheters.

Although we believe that all of our communications regarding off-label uses are in compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements, the FDA or another regulatory authority may disagree, and characterize such communications as marketing
 and promotion of an off-label use. 

If the FDA determines that we have marketed or promoted our products for off-label use by us or our commercial partners, it could request that we or our commercial partners modify those promotional materials. We also could be subject to
 regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letters or warning letters, injunctions, seizures, civil fines and criminal penalties. 

29 

Table of Contents 

In addition to FDA, we may be subject to significant enforcement actions from other federal and state enforcement authorities, such as the Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human
 Services, if they consider our communications, including promotional and training materials, to constitute promotion of an uncleared, uncertified or unapproved use of a medical device. In the U.S., engaging in the impermissible promotion of our
 products, following approval, for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims and other litigation under federal and state statutes, including fraud and abuse and consumer protection laws, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and
 fines, agreements with governmental authorities that materially restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute therapeutic products and do business through, for example, corporate integrity agreements, suspension or exclusion from
 participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and debarment from government contracts and refusal of future orders under existing contracts. These laws include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit
 against a company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims or causing others to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government
 decides to intervene and prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in the proceeds from any fines or settlement funds. If the government declines to intervene, the individual may pursue the case alone. Many False Claims Act lawsuits
 against, and preceding investigations of, manufacturers of healthcare products are brought every year, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements related to off-label uses. In addition, False Claims Act lawsuits may expose
 manufacturers to follow-on claims by private payors based on fraudulent marketing practices. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a company will have to defend a false claim action, pay settlement fines or restitution, as well as
 criminal and civil penalties, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations, and be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal and state healthcare programs. If we or our collaborators do not lawfully promote our
 approved products, we may become subject to such investigations and litigation and, if we do not successfully defend against such actions, those actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
 operations and prospects. 

Additionally, we must have adequate substantiation for the claims we make for our products and services. If any of our claims are determined to be false, misleading or deceptive, our products and services could be considered misbranded under
 the FDCA or in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. We could also face lawsuits from our competitors under the Lanham Act alleging that our marketing materials are false or misleading. 

Foreign jurisdictions have their own laws and regulations concerning medical devices, including marketing authorizations and certifications, communications about off-label uses, and substantiation of advertising and promotional claims. Failure
 to comply with those laws and regulations could result in actions against us, including fines, penalties and exclusion from the market. Any such actions could adversely affect our ability to market new products and services or continue to market
 existing products and services in those jurisdictions.

ITEM 2. 

UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

On August 23, 2024, the Company entered into a placement agency agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann Co. Inc. and a securities purchase agreement with certain purchasers pursuant to which the Company agreed to
 sell, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 483,351 shares of the Company s common stock, 0.0001 par value per share, at a purchase price of 1.8450 per Share and accompanying Common Warrant.

The Shares were sold pursuant to the Company s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-280647), including a base prospectus contained therein, which was originally filed with the Securities
 and Exchange Commission (the SEC on July 1, 2024, and was declared effective by the SEC on July 9, 2024, and a related prospectus supplement, dated August 23, 2024, related to the Registered Offering.

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, in a concurrent private placement the Company also agreed to sell and issue to the Purchasers, warrants to purchase up to 483,351 shares of Common Stock. The Common Warrants
 have an exercise price of 1.72 per share, are immediately exercisable and expire on the fifth anniversary on the effective date of the registration statement to be filed for the purpose of registering the Common Warrant Shares.

The gross proceeds of the Offering, before deducting the Placement Agent s fees and expenses and other offering expenses payable by the Company and excluding the net proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the Common Warrants or Placement Agent
 Warrants, were approximately 892,000. The Offering closed on August 26, 2024. The Company also issued to the Placement Agent, or its designees, warrants to purchase up to 14,501 shares of our Common Stock as part of the compensation payable to
 the Placement Agent in connection with this offering. The Placement Agent Warrants are not registered pursuant to the prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. The Placement Agent Warrants have substantially the same terms as the
 Common Warrants described above, except that the Placement Agent Warrants will have an exercise price of 3.04425 per share and will expire August 23, 2029.

 corporation may require.

ARTICLE III

 STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS 

4. PLACE OF MEETINGS. Meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be held at such
 place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead
 be held solely by means of remote communication as provided under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL ).

5. ANNUAL MEETINGS. 

(a) The annual meeting of the stockholders of the corporation, for the purpose of election of directors and for such other business as may properly
 come before it, shall be held on such date and at such time as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation and the proposal of business to be
 considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders: (i) pursuant to the corporation s notice of meeting of stockholders (with respect to business other than nominations); (ii) brought specifically by or at the direction
 of the Board of Directors; or (iii) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving the stockholder s notice provided for in Section 5(b) below, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied
 with the notice procedures set forth in Section 5. For the avoidance of doubt, clause (iii) above shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations and submit other business (other than matters properly included in the
 corporation s notice of meeting of stockholders and proxy statement under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the 1934
 Act )) before an annual meeting of stockholders.

(b) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as is a proper matter for stockholder action under Delaware law and
 as shall have been properly brought before the meeting.

3 

(i) For nominations for the election to the Board of Directors to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause
 (iii) of Section 5(a) of these Third Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws ), the stockholder must deliver written notice to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
 corporation on a timely basis as set forth in Section 5(b)(iii) and must update and supplement such written notice on a timely basis as set forth in Section 5(c). Such stockholder s notice shall set forth: (A) as to each nominee such stockholder
 proposes to nominate at the meeting: (1) the name, age, business address and residence address of such nominee, (2) the principal occupation or employment of such nominee, (3) the class and number of shares of each class of capital stock of the
 corporation which are owned of record and beneficially by such nominee, (4) the date or dates on which such shares were acquired and the investment intent of such acquisition, and (5) such other information concerning such nominee as would be
 required to be disclosed in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of such nominee as a director in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved), or that is otherwise required to be disclosed pursuant to Section
 14 of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (including such person s written consent to being named as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (B) the information required by Section 5(b)(iv). The
 corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a
 reasonable stockholder s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such proposed nominee.

(ii) Other than proposals sought to be included in the corporation s proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14(a)-8 under the 1934 Act, for business other than nominations for the election to the
 Board of Directors to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 5(a) of these Bylaws, the stockholder must deliver written notice to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
 corporation on a timely basis as set forth in Section 5(b)(iii), and must update and supplement such written notice on a timely basis as set forth in Section 5(c). Such stockholder s notice shall set forth: (A) as to each matter such stockholder
 proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and any material interest (including any anticipated benefit of such
 business to any Proponent (as defined below) other than solely as a result of its ownership of the corporation s capital stock, that is material to any Proponent individually, or to the Proponents in the aggregate) in such business of any
 Proponent; and (B) the information required by Section 5(b)(iv).

(iii) To be timely, the written notice required by Section 5(b)(i) or 5(b)(ii) must be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of
 the corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year s annual meeting; provided,
 however, that, subject to the last sentence of this Section 5(b)(iii), in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than thirty (30) days prior to or delayed by more than thirty (30) days after the anniversary of the preceding
 year s annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of
 the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. In no event shall an adjournment or a postponement of an annual meeting for
 which notice has been given, or the public announcement thereof has been made, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder s notice as described above.

4 

(iv) The written notice required by Section 5(b)(i) or 5(b)(ii) shall also set forth, as of the date of the notice and as to the stockholder giving the
 notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (each, a Proponent and collectively, the Proponents ): (A) the name and address of each Proponent, as they appear on the corporation s books; (B) the class, series and number of shares of the corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by each Proponent; (C) a
 description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether oral or in writing) with respect to such nomination or proposal between or among any Proponent and any of its affiliates or associates, and any others (including their names)
 acting in concert, or otherwise under the agreement, arrangement or understanding, with any of the foregoing; (D) a representation that the Proponents are holders of record or beneficial owners, as the case may be, of shares of the corporation
 entitled to vote at the meeting and intend to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice (with respect to a notice under Section 5(b)(i)) or to propose the business that is specified in the
 notice (with respect to a notice under Section 5(b)(ii)); (E) a representation as to whether the Proponents intend to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to a sufficient number of holders of the corporation s voting shares to elect such
 nominee or nominees (with respect to a notice under Section 5(b)(i)) or to carry such proposal (with respect to a notice under Section 5(b)(ii)); (F) to the extent known by any Proponent, the name and address of any other stockholder supporting the
 proposal on the date of such stockholder s notice; and (G) a description of all Derivative Transactions (as defined below) by each Proponent during the previous twelve (12) month period, including the date of the transactions and the class, series
 and number of securities involved in, and the material economic terms of, such Derivative Transactions.

For purposes of Sections 5 and 6, a Derivative Transaction means any agreement, arrangement, interest or understanding entered into
 by, or on behalf or for the benefit of, any Proponent or any of its affiliates or associates, whether record or beneficial:

(w) the value of which is derived in whole or in part from the value of any class or series of shares or other securities of the corporation,

(x) which otherwise provides any direct or indirect opportunity to gain or share in any gain derived from a change in the value of securities of the
 corporation,

(y) the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss, manage risk or benefit of security value or price changes, or

(z) which provides the right to vote or increase or decrease the voting power of, such Proponent, or any of its affiliates or associates, with
 respect to any securities of the corporation, which agreement, arrangement, interest or understanding may include, without limitation, any option, warrant, debt position, note, bond, convertible security, swap, stock appreciation right, short
 position, profit interest, hedge, right to dividends, voting agreement, performance-related fee or arrangement to borrow or lend shares (whether or not subject to payment, settlement, exercise or conversion in any such class or series), and any
 proportionate interest of such Proponent in the securities of the corporation held by any general or limited partnership, or any limited liability company, of which such Proponent is, directly or indirectly, a general partner or managing member.

(c) A stockholder providing written notice required by Section 5(b)(i) or (ii) shall update and supplement such notice in writing, if necessary, so that
 the information provided or required to be provided in such notice is true and correct in all material respects as of (i) the record date for the meeting and (ii) the date that is five (5) business days prior to the meeting and, in the event of any
 adjournment or postponement thereof, five (5) business days prior to such adjourned or postponed meeting. In the case of an update and supplement pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 5(c), such update and supplement shall be received by the
 Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for the meeting. In the case of an update and supplement pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 5(c), such update and
 supplement shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than two (2) business days prior to the date for the meeting, and, in the event of any adjournment or postponement thereof, two (2)
 business days prior to such adjourned or postponed meeting.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5(b)(iii) to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors in an Expiring Class (as defined below) is
 increased and there is no public announcement of the appointment of a director to such class, or, if no appointment was made, of the vacancy in such class, made by the corporation at least ten (10) days before the last day a stockholder may deliver
 a notice of nomination in accordance with Section 5(b) (iii), a stockholder s notice required by this Section 5 and which complies with the requirements in Section 5(b)(i), other than the timing requirements in Section 5(b)(iii), shall also be
 considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions in such Expiring Class created by such increase, if it shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of
 business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation. For purposes of this Section, an Expiring Class shall mean a
 class of directors whose term shall expire at the next annual meeting of stockholders.

5 

(e) A person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as a director unless the person is nominated either in accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5(a), or in accordance with
 clause (iii) of Section 5(a). Except as otherwise required by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made, or proposed, as the
 case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, or the Proponent does not act in accordance with the representations in Sections 5(b)
 (iv)(D) and 5(b)(iv)(E), to declare that such proposal or nomination shall not be presented for stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such nominations or such business may have been
 solicited or received.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy
 statement and form of proxy for a stockholders meeting, a stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to affect any rights of
 stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act; provided, however, that any references in these Bylaws to the 1934 Act or the rules and regulations thereunder are not
 intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to proposals and/or nominations to be considered pursuant to Section 5(a) (iii) of these Bylaws.

(g) For purposes of Sections 5 and 6,

 (i) public announcement shall mean disclosure in
 a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the
 1934 Act; and

(ii) affiliates and associates shall have the meanings set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act ).

6. SPECIAL MEETINGS. 

(a) Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be called, for any purpose as is a proper matter for stockholder action under Delaware
 law, by (i) the Chairman of the Board of Directors, (ii) the Chief Executive Officer, or (iii) the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any
 vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board of Directors for adoption).

(b) The Board of Directors shall determine the time and place, if any, of such special meeting. Upon determination of the time and place, if any, of the
 meeting, the Secretary shall cause a notice of meeting to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of these Bylaws. No business may be transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified
 in the notice of meeting.

(c) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected
 (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving notice provided for in this paragraph, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who
 delivers written notice to the Secretary of the corporation setting forth the information required by Section 5(b)(i). In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the
 Board of Directors, any such stockholder of record may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation s notice of meeting, if written notice setting forth the information required
 by Section 5(b) (i) of these Bylaws shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such meeting or the tenth (10th) day
 following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. The stockholder shall also update and supplement such information
 as required under Section 5(c). In no event shall an adjournment or a postponement of a special meeting for which notice has been given, or the public announcement thereof has been made, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder s
 notice as described above.

6 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, a stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and the
 rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 6. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation s proxy statement pursuant to
 Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act; provided, however, that any references in these Bylaws to the 1934 Act or the rules and regulations thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations for the election to the
 Board of Directors to be considered pursuant to Section 6(c) of these Bylaws.

7. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. Except as otherwise provided by law, notice, given in writing or by electronic
 transmission, of each meeting of stockholders shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, such notice to specify the place, if any, date
 and hour, in the case of special meetings, the purpose or purposes of the meeting, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at any such meeting. If
 mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder s address as it appears on the records of the corporation. Notice of the time, place, if any, and purpose of any
 meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, signed by the person entitled to notice thereof, or by electronic transmission by such person, either before or after such meeting, and will be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat in
 person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by proxy, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully
 called or convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given.

8. QUORUM. At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by statute or by
 the corporation s Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as it may be amended from time to time (the Certificate of Incorporation ), or by these Bylaws, the presence,
 in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum,
 any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, either by the chairman of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. The
 stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Except as otherwise
 provided by statute or by applicable stock exchange rules, or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person, by remote
 communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
 Bylaws, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote generally on the election of directors. Where a
 separate vote by a class or classes or series is required, except where otherwise provided by the statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes or series, present in
 person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. Except where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of
 Incorporation or these Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of the election of directors) of shares of such class or classes or series present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by
 proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class or classes or series.

7 

9. ADJOURNMENT AND NOTICE OF ADJOURNED MEETINGS. Any meeting of stockholders, whether
 annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time either by the chairman of the meeting or by the vote of a majority of the shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting. When a meeting
 is adjourned to another time or place, if any, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may
 transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting
 shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

10. VOTING RIGHTS. For the purpose of determining those stockholders entitled to vote at any
 meeting of the stockholders, except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date, as provided in Section 12 of these Bylaws, shall be entitled to vote at any
 meeting of stockholders. Every person entitled to vote shall have the right to do so either in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by an agent or agents authorized by a proxy granted in accordance with Delaware law. An agent so
 appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted after three (3) years from its date of creation unless the proxy provides for a longer period.

11. JOINT OWNERS OF STOCK. If shares or other securities having voting power stand of record in the names of
 two (2) or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless
 the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect:
 (a) if only one (1) votes, his act binds all; (b) if more than one (1) votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one (1) votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may vote the securities
 in question proportionally, or may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery for relief as provided in the DGCL, Section 217(b). If the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or
 even-split for the purpose of subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-split in interest.

12. LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS. The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days
 before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.
 Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice
 of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable
 steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. The list shall be open to examination of any stockholder during the time of the meeting as provided by law.

13. ACTION WITHOUT MEETING. No action shall be taken by the stockholders except at an annual
 or special meeting of stockholders called in accordance with these Bylaws, and no action shall be taken by the stockholders by written consent or by electronic transmission.

8 

14. ORGANIZATION. 

(a) At every meeting of stockholders, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or, if a Chairman has not been appointed or is absent, the President, or,
 if the President is absent, a chairman of the meeting chosen by a majority in interest of the stockholders entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy, shall act as chairman. The Secretary, or, in his or her absence, an Assistant Secretary
 directed to do so by the President, shall act as secretary of the meeting.

(b) The Board of Directors of the corporation shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall
 deem necessary, appropriate or convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations of the Board of Directors, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all
 such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an agenda or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for
 maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, limitations on participation in such meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation and their duly authorized and constituted proxies and such other persons as the chairman
 shall permit, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof, limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants and regulation of the opening and closing of the polls for balloting on
 matters which are to be voted on by ballot. The date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at the meeting shall be announced at the meeting. Unless and to the extent determined by the
 Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with rules of parliamentary procedure.

ARTICLE IV

 DIRECTORS 

15. NUMBER AND TERM OF OFFICE. The authorized number of directors of the corporation shall be
 fixed in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation. If for any cause, the directors shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be
 elected as soon thereafter as convenient at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these Bylaws.

16. POWERS. The powers of the corporation shall be exercised, its business conducted and its
 property controlled by the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation.

17. CLASSES OF DIRECTORS. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect
 additional directors under specified circumstances, the directors shall be divided into three classes designated as Class I, Class II and Class III, respectively. The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors
 already in office to such classes at the time the classification becomes effective. At the first annual meeting of stockholders following the initial classification of the Board of Directors, the term of office of the Class I directors shall expire
 and the Class I directors shall be elected for a term of that will expire at the fourth annual meeting of stockholders following the initial classification of the Board of Directors. At the second annual meeting of stockholders following such
 initial classification, the term of office of the Class II directors shall expire and the Class II directors shall be elected for a term of that will expire at the fifth annual meeting of stockholders following the initial classification of the
 Board of Directors. At the third annual meeting of stockholders following such initial classification, the term of office of the Class III directors shall expire and the Class III directors shall be elected for a term of that will expire at the
 sixth annual meeting of stockholders following the initial classification of the Board of Directors. At each succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, directors shall be elected for a term that will expire at the third annual meeting of
 stockholders following such annual meeting to succeed the directors of the class whose terms expire at such annual meeting.

9 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, each director shall serve until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or
 removal. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

18. VACANCIES. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, and subject to the rights of
 the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of
 directors shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such vacancies or newly created directorships shall be filled by stockholders, be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office,
 even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, or by a sole remaining director, and not by the stockholders; provided, however, that whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or
 more directors by the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such vacancies or newly
 created directorships shall be filled by stockholders, be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected, and not by the stockholders. Any director
 elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the director for which the vacancy was created or occurred and until such director s successor shall have been elected and qualified. A

45. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER AGENTS.

 extent not prohibited by the DGCL or any other applicable law; provided, however, that the corporation may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with its directors and officers; and, provided, further, that the
 corporation shall not be required to indemnify any director or officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was
 authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation, (iii) such indemnification is provided by the corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under the DGCL or any other applicable law or (iv) such
 indemnification is required to be made under paragraph (d) of this Section.

(b) Employees and Other Agents. The corporation shall have the power to indemnify its
 employees and other agents as set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law. The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate the determination of whether indemnification shall be given to any such person to such officers or other
 persons as the Board of Directors shall determine.

(c) Expenses. The corporation shall advance to any person who was or is a party or is
 threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer, of the corporation, or
 is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all
 expenses incurred by any director or officer in connection with such proceeding; provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in
 any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an undertaking ), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to
 appeal (hereinafter a final adjudication that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section or otherwise.

17 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, no advance shall be made by the corporation to an officer of the corporation (except by reason
 of the fact that such officer is or was a director of the corporation in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and
 promptly made (i) by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, even if not a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if
 there are no such directors, or such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such
 person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.

(d) Enforcement. Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification
 and advances to directors and officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the corporation and the director or officer. Any right to
 indemnification or advances granted by this Section to a director or officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in
 whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. To the extent permitted by law, the claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid
 also the expense of prosecuting the claim. In connection with any claim for indemnification, the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible
 under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. In connection with any claim by an officer of the corporation (except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
 administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a director of the corporation) for advances, the corporation shall be entitled to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence that such
 person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such person acted without reasonable cause to
 believe that his conduct was lawful. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification
 of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because the officer or director has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of
 Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In
 any suit brought by a director or officer to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the burden of proving that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses,
 under this Section or otherwise shall be on the corporation.

(e) Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall not be
 exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
 action in such person s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents
 respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law.

18 

(f) Survival of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall continue as
 to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

(g) Insurance. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any other applicable law, the
 corporation, upon approval by the Board of Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Section.

(h) Amendments. Any repeal or modification of this Section shall only be prospective and
 shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation.

(i) Saving Clause. If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground
