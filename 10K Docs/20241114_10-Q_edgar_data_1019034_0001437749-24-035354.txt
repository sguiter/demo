In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2020 - 06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470 - 20 and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815 - 40 ASU 2020 - 06 to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020 - 06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020 - 06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related information contained herein and our audited financial statements as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Overview 
 
 BIO-key International, Inc. (the Company, BIO-key, we, or us is a leading identity and access management, or IAM, platform provider enabling secure work-from-anywhere for enterprise, education, and government customers. Our vision is to enable any organization to secure streamlined and passwordless workforce, employee, customer, student and citizen access to any online service, workstation, or mobile application, without a requirement to use tokens or phones. Our products include PortalGuard and PortalGuard Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) enterprise IAM, WEB-key biometric civil and large-scale ID infrastructure, and accessory hardware to provide a complete solution for our customers. 
 
 Millions of people use BIO-key multi-factor-authentication, or MFA, solutions every day to securely access a variety of cloud, mobile and web applications, on-premise and cloud-based servers from all of their devices. We go beyond passwordless to offer phone-less and token-less authentication methods. This critical differentiator is particularly effective for retail, call center, manufacturing, shop-floor, and healthcare environments which utilize roving workers and shared workstations. Unlike most digital identity solutions, BIO-key also plays a role in securing in-person identity. For example, a banking customer has enrolled over 25 million of its customers biometrics with BIO-key as part of their know your customer, or KYC process, and then uses BIO-key fingerprint technology each time their customers access bank services to ensure positive identification before transacting with them. 
 
 BIO-key PortalGuard and hosted PortalGuard IDaaS authentication platforms enable our customers to assure that only the right people can access the right systems by utilizing our world-class biometric capabilities, among 17 other available authentication methods. PortalGuard goes beyond traditional MFA solutions by allowing roving users to biometrically authenticate at any workstation without using their phones or tokens which addresses sizeable security gaps, including eliminating unauthorized account delegation, detecting duplicate users, and accommodating in-person identification. 
 
 Our customers use PortalGuard to manage and secure digital systems access by their employees, contractors and partners, which we call workforce identity. PortalGuard is also used to manage and secure the identities of an organization s customers through integration of APIs we have developed and industry-standard federation standards, which we call customer identity. By using PortalGuard, our customers can securely collaborate with their supply chain and partners, and provide their customers with flexible, resilient user experiences online or in-person. 
 
 In 2022, we expanded our product offerings and customer base when we acquired Swivel Secure Europe, a Madrid, Spain based provider of IAM solutions. Swivel Secure Europe is a distributer of the AuthControl Sentry, AuthControl Enterprise, and AuthControl MSP product line in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, or EMEA, excluding the United Kingdom and Ireland. These solutions include PINsafe, a patented one-time-code extraction technology, helping enterprises manage the increasing data security risks posed by cloud services and bring your own device policies. 
 
 Large-scale customer and civil ID customers use our scalable biometric management platform and FBI-certified scanner hardware to manage enrollment, de-duplication and authentication for millions of users.

Table of Contents 

We sell our branded USB fingerprint and FIDO authentication hardware as accessories to our IAM platforms, so that customers can have a single vendor providing all components of their IAM solution. Our fingerprint biometric platform is certified by NIST and unique among fingerprint platforms in that it supports mixing and matching of different manufactures fingerprint scanners in a deployment. This provides our customers with the flexibility to select the right scanner for their specific use case, without mandating the use of a particular scanner. 
 
 We operate a SaaS business model with customers subscribing to term use of our software for annual recurring revenue. We sell our products directly through our field and inside sales teams, as well as indirectly through our network of channel partners including resellers, system integrators, master agents and other distribution partners. Our subscription fees include a term license of hosted or on-premise product and technical support and maintenance of our platform. We base subscription fees primarily on the products used and the number of users enrolled in our platform. We generate subscription fees pursuant to noncancelable contracts with a weighted average duration of approximately one year. 
 
 Strategic Outlook 
 
 We plan to have a more significant role in the IAM market which continues to expand. With the adoption of MFA as a cybersecurity requirement, nearly all enterprises are beginning to adopt MFA for their user bases. We plan to continue to offer customers a suite of authentication options that complement our biometric solutions. Our ability to add value to or replace the first-generation MFA solutions deployed by these enterprises with our phone-less and token-less biometrics sets us apart from a crowded field of phone- and token-based MFA solutions. We believe that as enterprises experience the lifecycle costs associated with managing tokens and passwords, they will have an economic incentivize to consider adding BIO-key PortalGuard to their IAM solution. PortalGuard will allow them to continue to use their existing FIDO devices, while selectively augmenting their authentication options with tokenless and phoneless biometric choices. 
 
 We expect to grow our business within government services and highly-regulated industries in which we have historically had a strong presence including financial services, higher education, and healthcare. We believe that continued heightened security and privacy requirements in these industries, and as colleges and universities continue operating in remote environments, we will generate increased demand for security solutions, including biometrics. In addition, we expect that the compatible, yet superior portable biometric user experience offered by our technology for Windows 10 users will accelerate the demand for our computer network log-on solutions and fingerprint readers. Through value add-offerings via direct sales, resellers, and strategic partnerships with leading higher education platform providers, we will continue to grow our installed base. Through Swivel Secure Europe, we also expect to grow our business in EMEA. 
 
 Our primary sales strategies are focused on (i) increased marketing efforts into the IAM market, (ii) dedicated pursuit of large-scale identification projects across the globe, and (iii) growing our channel alliance program which we have grown to more than one hundred and fifty participants and continues to generate incremental revenues. 
 
 A second component of our growth strategy is to pursue strategic acquisitions of select businesses and assets in the IAM space. In furtherance of this strategy, we are active in the industry and regularly evaluate businesses that we believe will either provide an entry into new market verticals or be synergistic with our existing operations and in either case, be accretive to earnings. We cannot provide any assurance as to whether we will be able to complete any acquisition and if completed, successfully integrate any business we acquire into our operations. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 The current trend of continued remote work environments increases the risk of unauthorized users, phishing attacks, and hackers who are eager to take advantage of the challenges of securing remote workers. A growing trend of security incidents that highlight potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities, additional regulatory requirements, and increasingly stringent Cyber Insurance underwriting standards that mandate enhanced security solutions has resulted in many businesses requiring MFA for their employees, partners and customers to access their business systems and data. We believe that biometrics should continue to play a key role in remote user authentication.

 The following sets forth our investment sources of capital during the previous two years: 
 
 On September 12, 2024, we entered into a warrant exercise agreement with an existing investor (the Investor to exercise certain outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,030,556 shares of the Company s common stock. The warrants were originally issued to the Investor on October 31, 2023 and had an original exercise price of 3.15 per share. In consideration for the immediate exercise of the warrants, we reduced the exercise price of the warrants to 1.85 per share and issued to the Investor unregistered Series A Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,030,556 shares of the Company's common stock and unregistered Series B Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,030,556 shares of the Company's common stock, each with an exercise price of 1.85 per share. The Series A and Series B warrants share substantially the same terms, are immediately exercisable and will expire five years from the date of issuance. The forgoing transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately 1.9 million prior to deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses. 
 
 On June 24, 2024, we entered into and closed a note purchase agreement which provided for the issuance of a 2,360,000 principal amount senior secured promissory note (the "2024 Note"). This resulted in gross proceeds of approximately 1,826,000 after deducting placement agent fees, estimated offering expenses, and the original issue discount. The 2024 Note is due eighteen months (18) following the date of issuance, accrues interest at a rate of nine percent (9 per annum, and commencing six months after the date of issuance of, the lender shall have the right to redeem up to 270,000 of principal amount each month. For a more complete description of the 2024 Note, please see Note 9 to Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I Item 1 of this report. In connection with the warrant exercise agreement described above, we prepaid approximately 762,600 of the amount due under the 2024 Note. 
 
 On November 20, 2023, we completed a private placement of shares of common stock and warrants resulting in net proceeds of approximately 435,000, after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses. 
 
 On October 30, 2023, we completed a public offering of units consisting of shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock, and warrants to purchase share of common stock. Each Unit was sold at a public offering price of 0.175. resulting in net proceeds of 3.3 million, after deducting the placement agent fees and offering expenses. 
 
 In December 2022, we entered into and closed a securities purchase agreement with AJB Capital Investments, LLC under which we issued a 2,2 million principal amount senior secured promissory note (the Note ). The principal amount of the Note was due six months following the date of issuance, subject to one six-month extension. Interest under the Note accrued at a rate of 10 per annum, payable monthly through month six and at 12 per annum in months seven through twelve, payable monthly. The Note was secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and properties. The Note was repaid in December 2023. 
 
 We entered into an accounts receivable factoring arrangement with a financial institution (the Factor which has been extended to October 31, 2025 and may be discontinued at that time. Pursuant to the terms of the arrangement, from time to time, we sell to the Factor a minimum of 150,000 per quarter of certain of our accounts receivable balances on a non-recourse basis for credit approved accounts. The Factor remits 35 of the foreign and 75 of the domestic accounts receivable balance to us (the Advance Amount ), with the remaining balance, less fees, forwarded to us once the Factor collects the full accounts receivable balance from the customer. In addition, from time to time, we receive over advances from the Factor. Factoring fees range from 2.75 to 15 of the face value of the invoice factored and are determined by the number of days required for collection of the invoice. We expect to continue to use this factoring arrangement periodically to assist with our general working capital requirements due to contractual requirements.

Liquidity outlook 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our total cash and cash equivalents were 1,801,137, as compared to 511,400 at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, we had negative working capital of approximately 1,320,000. 
 
 As discussed above, we have historically financed our operations through access to the capital markets by issuing secured and convertible debt securities, convertible preferred stock, common stock, and through factoring receivables. We currently require approximately 732,000 per month to conduct our operations, a monthly amount that we have been unable to consistently achieve through revenue generation. We also have approximately 3.5 million of inventory (currently reserved) purchased for projects in Nigeria. We continue to explore other markets and opportunities to sell the product to generate additional cash. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue to fund current operations and execute our business plan, we will need to obtain additional third-party financing. Unless we generate sufficient positive cash flow from operations or liquidation of existing inventory, we expect that we will need to obtain additional financing during the next twelve months to support operations. 
 
 In addition, as reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed June 14, 2024, we are no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing rules which require us to maintain stockholders' equity of at least 2,500,000. Our plan to regain compliance will require us to raise additional equity capital in the near term, or engage in a strategic transaction. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital or regain compliance with the continued listing requirements. 
 
 Our long-term viability and growth will depend upon the successful commercialization of our technologies and our ability to obtain adequate financing. To the extent that we require such additional financing, no assurance can be given that any form of additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, that adequate financing will be obtained to meet our needs, or that such financing would not be dilutive to existing stockholders. If available financing is insufficient or unavailable or we fail to continue to generate sufficient revenue, we may be required to further reduce operating expenses, delay the expansion of operations, be unable to pursue merger or acquisition candidates, or in the extreme case, not continue as a going concern. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
 
 As previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, our management identified a lack of control over properly assessing revenue, allowances for accounts receivable and certain reserves for inventory. This resulted in certain errors in the manner in which we recognized revenue generated by our European subsidiary, Swivel Secure Europe, SA, in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, certain allowances for accounts receivable and certain reserves for inventory were understated. We are currently working to implement appropriate corrective actions to remediate the material weakness to strengthen our internal controls over the recording of revenues. This has included thoroughly accessing all accounts for potential adjustments required for proper presentation of the value of the accounts, changing management of our Swivel Secure operation, and implementing additional revenue recognition controls. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
