 reinsurers in the Superior Court, State of Vermont, Franklin Unit, seeking a judgment declaring that the Company's business interruption and other losses associated with COVID-19 are covered by the Company's property insurance program. The Company also initiated arbitration proceedings against other reinsurers seeking similar relief. In July 2021, the Vermont court granted the reinsurers motion for judgment on the pleadings, which would have ended the Company s claim. The Company appealed the decision to the Vermont Supreme Court, which reversed and remanded the lower court s decision in September 2022, allowing the Company s claim to proceed. No assurances can be provided regarding the ultimate resolution of this matter. 
 
 U.S. Government Investigations and Claims - Departments and agencies of the U.S. Government have the authority to investigate various transactions and operations of the Company, and the results of such investigations may lead to administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of which could be fines, penalties, repayments or compensatory, treble, or other damages. U.S. Government regulations provide that certain findings against a contractor may also lead to suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export privileges. Any suspension or debarment would have a material effect on the Company because of its reliance on government contracts. 
 
 During the third quarter, the Company identified certain quality issues involving noncompliance with welding procedures at Newport News. The Company has commenced an investigation and disclosed the matter to the U.S. Government. The Company is working with its U.S. Navy customer to evaluate the full extent of the matter and its potential impact on operations. Based upon the early stage of the Company s investigation, the Company cannot at this time predict or reasonably estimate the outcome of this matter, including its financial impact.

 U.S. Government Claims - From time to time, the U.S. Government communicates to the Company potential claims, disallowed costs, and penalties concerning prior costs incurred by the Company with which the U.S. Government disagrees. When such preliminary findings are presented, the Company and U.S. Government representatives engage in discussions, from which the Company evaluates the merits of the claims and assesses the amounts being questioned. Although the Company believes that the resolution of any of these matters will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, it cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters.

 The following discussion should be read along with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our "2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K"). 
 
 Business Environment 
 
 We continue to see uncertainty in the economy, our industry, and our company. Our customers and suppliers continue to face challenges, and our results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, have been adversely affected as we continue to experience significant challenges relating to labor availability, our supply chain, and inflation, among other challenges. We cannot clearly predict how long these challenges will continue, whether these challenges will change over time, or whether our actions to address these challenges will be successful. 
 
 Defense Spending Environment - The President submitted the fiscal year 2025 Budget Request on March 11, 2024, which is under consideration by Congress. The budget request reflects continued investment in shipbuilding, funding two Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) surface combatants, one San Antonio class (LPD 17) amphibious warship, and the lead Block VI Virginia class (SSN 774) submarine, which is proposed to be executed as a multiyear procurement. Additionally, the budget request continues funding for Ford class (CVN 78) nuclear aircraft carriers and the first of three years of full funding for the refueling and complex overhaul of USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75). The budget request continues investment in the submarine industrial base and research and development on next generation large surface combatants (DDG(X)) and nuclear submarines (SSN(X)). 
 
 Congressional consideration of the fiscal year 2025 President s Budget Request began following its release in March 2024 and is continuing. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees have acted on their respective National Defense Authorization bills for fiscal year 2025. The full House approved its authorization bill, and the full Senate has not yet completed floor consideration of the Senate version. It is expected that the two bills will be reconciled to produce a final authorization measure. The full House also approved the fiscal year 2025 defense appropriations bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee advanced its defense appropriations measure out of committee and awaits further consideration by the full Senate. 
 
 Appropriations for the Federal government for fiscal year 2025 have yet to be finalized, and the U.S. Government is therefore currently operating under a Continuing Resolution ("CR"), which funds government operations through December 20, 2024. We cannot predict the outcome of the fiscal year 2025 budget process, and it remains uncertain at this point whether fiscal year 2025 government operations will require additional short-term funding or if annual appropriations measures will be finalized by the expiration of the CR. 
 
 Global Geopolitical and Economic Environment - The global geopolitical and economic environment continues to be impacted by uncertainty, heightened geopolitical tensions, and instability. Geopolitical relationships continue to change, and the U.S. and its allies face a global security environment that includes threats from state and non-state actors, including major global powers, as well as terrorist organizations, emerging nuclear tensions, diverse regional security concerns, and political instability. These global threats persist across all domains, from undersea to space to cyber, and the global market for defense products, services, and solutions is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges. Our current operating environment exists in the broader context of political and socioeconomic priorities and reflects, among other things, the continued impact of and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical tensions, financial market volatility, inflation, and a challenging labor market.

 Operating Performance Assessment and Reporting 
 
 We manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below, with consideration given to the Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments referred to in this section. Our portfolio of long-term contracts is largely flexibly-priced. Therefore, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts, with operating income being a critical measure of operating performance. Under FAR rules that govern our business with the U.S. Government, most types of costs are allowable, and we do not focus on individual cost groupings, such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses, as much as we do on total contract costs, which are a key factor in determining contract operating income. As a result, in evaluating our operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues, as well as operating income, including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract financial estimates and the use of the cumulative catch-up method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. This approach is consistent with the long-term life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance in a similar manner through contract completion. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing our business.

 Sales and Service Revenues 
 
 Period-to-period revenues reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts. Changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume. Unless otherwise described, volume generally refers to increases (or decreases) in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels, delivery rates, or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the profit margin rate for a particular contract. 
 
 Sales and service revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 67 million, or 2 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower volumes at Ingalls and Newport News, partially offset by higher volumes at Mission Technologies. 
 
 Sales and service revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 254 million, or 3 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher volumes at Mission Technologies and Ingalls, partially offset by lower volumes at Newport News. 
 
 Cost of Sales and Service Revenues 
 
 Cost of sales for both product sales and service revenues consists of materials, labor, and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs for overhead. We manage the type and amount of costs at the contract level, which is the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of our contracts. Unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis. 
 
 Refer to "Segment Operating Results" and "Product and Service Revenues and Cost Analysis" in this section for details related to cost of sales for both product sales and service revenues. 
 
 Income from Operating Investments, Net 
 
 The activities of our operating investments are closely aligned with the operations of the segments holding the investments. We therefore record income related to earnings from equity method investments in our operating income. 
 
 Refer to "Segment Operating Results" in this section for details related to income from operating investments. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 In accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts, most general and administrative expenses are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts. These costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis, and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost. 
 
 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1 million from the same period in 2023. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 28 million from the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher overhead costs. 
 
 Operating Income 
 
 We consider operating income an important measure for evaluating our operating performance, and, consistent with industry practice, we define operating income as revenues less the related costs of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses. 
 
 We internally manage our operations by reference to "segment operating income," which is defined as operating income before the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment and non-current state income taxes, neither of which affects contract performance. Segment operating income is not a recognized measure under GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use segment operating income in addition to, and not as an alternative for, operating income or any other performance measure presented in accordance with GAAP. It is a measure we use to evaluate our core operating performance. We believe segment operating income reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We believe the measure is used by investors and is a

 useful indicator to measure our performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of segment operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Refer to 
 "Segment Operating Results" in this section for details related to segment operating income, as well as activity within each segment. 
 
 The following table reconciles operating income to segment operating income: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 vs. 2023 2024 vs. 2023 in millions) 2024 2023 Dollars Percent 2024 2023 Dollars Percent Operating income 82 172 (90) (52) 425 469 (44) (9) Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment 16 19 (3) (16) 48 55 (7) (13) Non-current state income taxes (1) (4) 3 75 (3) (12) 9 75 Segment operating income 97 187 (90) (48) 470 512 (42) (8) 
 
 FAS/CAS Adjustment and Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment 
 
 The FAS/CAS Adjustment reflects the difference between expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") and the expenses for these items included in segment operating income in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards ("CAS"). The Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment excludes the following components of net periodic benefit costs: interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost (credit) and actuarial loss (gain), and settlement and curtailment effects. 
 
 The components of the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment were as follows: Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 vs. 2023 2024 vs. 2023 in millions) 2024 2023 Dollars Percent 2024 2023 Dollars Percent FAS benefit 15 8 7 88 48 23 25 109 CAS cost 13 10 3 30 38 33 5 15 FAS/CAS Adjustment 28 18 10 56 86 56 30 54 Non-operating retirement benefit (44) (37) (7) (19) (134) (111) (23) (21) Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment expense (16) (19) 3 16 (48) (55) 7 13 
 
 The Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment was a net expense of 16 million and 19 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment was a net expense of 48 million and 55 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The favorable change in the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment for each period was primarily driven by demographic assumptions, partially offset by lower interest rates under FAS. 
 
 Non-current State Income Taxes 
 
 Non-current state income taxes include deferred state income taxes, which reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities, and the tax expense or benefit associated with changes in state unrecognized tax benefits in the relevant period. These amounts are recorded within operating income. Current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income. 
 
 Non-current state income tax benefit was 1 million and 4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Non-current state income tax benefit was 3 million and 12 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The unfavorable change in non-current state income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was driven by an increase in deferred state income tax expense, primarily attributable to a change in the timing of long-term contract income for tax purposes. The unfavorable change in non-current state income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was driven by an increase in deferred state income tax expense, primarily attributable to a change in net capitalized research and development expenditures and the timing of long-term contract income for tax purposes.

 SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS 
 
 Our discussion of business segment performance focuses on sales and service revenues and operating income, consistent with our approach for managing our business. We are aligned into three reportable segments: Ingalls, Newport News, and Mission Technologies. 
 
 The following table presents segment operating results: Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 vs. 2023 2024 vs. 2023 in millions) 2024 2023 Dollars Percent 2024 2023 Dollars Percent Sales and Service Revenues Ingalls 664 711 (47) (7) 2,031 1,952 79 4 Newport News 1,412 1,453 (41) (3) 4,381 4,468 (87) (2) Mission Technologies

 Segment Operating Income 
 
 Segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a segment. Excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance, such as the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment and non-current state income taxes. Changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume, as discussed above, or performance. Performance refers to changes in contract profit margin rates. These changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to estimated costs at completion ("EAC") on a contract, which reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on that contract. Operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an EAC change is recorded. Segment operating income may also be affected by, among other things, contract performance, the effects of workforce stoppages, the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes, resolution of disputed items with the customer, recovery of insurance proceeds, and other discrete events. At the completion of a long-term contract, any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized, such as warranty reserves, could also impact contract earnings. Where such items have occurred and the effects are material, a separate description is provided. 
 
 Net Cumulative Catch-up Revenue Adjustments

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 23 million, compared with 22 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 68 million, compared with 70 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Non-Operating Retirement Benefit 
 
 The non-operating retirement benefit includes the following components of net periodic benefit costs: interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost (credit) and actuarial loss (gain), and settlement and curtailment effects. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the non-operating retirement benefit was 44 million, compared with 37 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the non-operating retirement benefit was 134 million, compared with 111 million for the same period in 2023. The increases in the non-operating retirement benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily driven by higher 2023 returns on plan assets. 
 
 Other, Net 
 
 Other, net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 9 million, compared with other, net income of 2 million for the same period in 2023. Other, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 21 million, compared with other, net income of 11 million for the same period in 2023. The increases in other, net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily driven by higher unrealized net gains on investments. 
 
 Federal and Foreign Income Taxes 
 
 Our effective income tax rates on earnings from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were and , respectively. Our effective income tax rates on earnings from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were and , respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to current and prior period research and development tax credits recorded in the current period. The lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to current and prior period research and development tax credits recorded in the current period and to a taxable gain associated with the sale of our interest in an unconsolidated ship repair and specialty fabrication joint venture recorded in 2023. 
 
 For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory corporate income tax rate of primarily due to research and development tax credits for the current and prior periods. 

BACKLOG 
 
 Total backlog as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was 49.4 billion and 48.1 billion, respectively. Total backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer). Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity orders. For contracts having no stated contract values, backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer.

 We expect approximately 22 of the 48.1 billion total backlog as of December 31, 2023, to be converted into sales in 2024. U.S. Government orders comprised substantially all of the backlog as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Contract Awards 
 
 The value of new contract awards during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 9.8 billion, including an award for the maintenance and overhaul of USS Boise (SSN 764), an award for an advanced planning contract for the RCOH of USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) and an award for construction of USS Richard J. Danzig (DDG 143). 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 We seek to efficiently convert operating results into cash for deployment in operating our businesses, implementing our business strategy, and maximizing stockholder value. We use various financial measures to inform our capital deployment strategy, including net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow. We believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance. 
 
 The following table summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 vs. 2023 in millions) 2024 2023 Dollars Net earnings 427 407 20 Depreciation and amortization of purchased intangible assets 242 259 (17) Other non-cash transactions, net 7 16 (9) Stock-based compensation 15 27 (12) Deferred income taxes (55) (81) 26 Gain on investments in marketable securities (22) (10) (12) Retiree benefits (84) (55) (29) Trade working capital increase (528) (155) (373) Net cash provided by operating activities 2 408 (406) 
 We have historically maintained a capital structure comprised of a mix of equity and debt financing. We vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions. We expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations, existing borrowing facilities, and/or through refinancing in the debt markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 We discuss below our significant operating, investing, and financing activities affecting cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as classified in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 

27 

Table of Contents 

 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 2 million, compared with cash provided by operating activities of 408 million for the same period in 2023. The unfavorable change in operating cash flow was primarily due to an unfavorable change in trade working capital driven by the timing of billings across programs, partially offset by lower payments for income taxes. 
 
 We expect cash generated from operations in combination with our current cash and cash equivalents, as well as existing borrowing facilities, to be sufficient to service debt and retiree benefit plans, meet contractual obligations, and fund capital expenditures for at least the next 12 calendar months beginning October 1, 2024, and beyond such 12-month period based on our current business plans. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 238 million, compared to 111 million used in investing activities for the same period in 2023. The change in investing cash was primarily driven by the sale of our interest in an unconsolidated ship repair and specialty fabrication joint venture in 2023 and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by additional investment in one of our unconsolidated nuclear and environmental joint ventures in 2023. 
 
 For 2024, we expect our capital expenditures for maintenance and sustainment to be approximately 1.0 to 1.5 of annual revenues and our discretionary capital expenditures to be approximately 2.0 to 2.5 of annual revenues. Our capital expenditures are increasing compared to the past few years due to investments to expand our shipbuilding capacity. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 184 million, compared with 655 million used in financing activities for the same period in 2023. The change in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a 396 million increase in proceeds from our commercial paper program and lower repayment of debt in the current year, partially offset by a 125 million increase in common stock repurchases. 
 
 Free Cash Flow 
 
 Free cash flow represents cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures net of related grant proceeds. Free cash flow is not a measure recognized under GAAP. Free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net earnings as a measure of our performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for our investors because it provides them insight into our current and period-to-period performance and our ability to generate cash from continuing operations. We also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 
 The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 vs. 2023 in millions) 2024 2023 Dollars Net cash provided by operating activities 2 408 (406) Less capital expenditures: Capital expenditure additions (253) (164) (89) Grant proceeds for capital expenditures 14 14 Free cash flow (237) 258 (495) 
 
 Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 495 million from the same period in 2023, primarily due to an unfavorable change in trade working capital driven by the timing of billings across programs and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower payments for income taxes.

 Governmental Regulation and Supervision 
 
 The U.S. Government has the ability, pursuant to regulations relating to contractor business systems, to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more such systems. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the cumulative amounts of payments withheld by the U.S. Government under our contracts subject to these regulations were not material to our liquidity or cash flows. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we use letters of credit issued by commercial banks to support certain leases, insurance policies, and contractual performance obligations, as well as surety bonds issued by insurance companies principally to support our self-insured workers' compensation plans. As of September 30, 2024, 11 million in letters of credit were issued but undrawn and 360 million of surety bonds were outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, we had no other significant off-balance sheet arrangements.

 Virginia class (SSN 774) fast attack submarines 
 Construct attack submarines as the principal subcontractor to Electric Boat. The Virginia class (SSN 774) is a post-Cold War design tailored to excel in a wide range of warfighting missions, including anti-submarine and surface ship warfare; special operation forces; strike; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; carrier and expeditionary strike group support; and mine warfare. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to certain market risks, including those relating to interest rates and inflation. 
 
 Interest Rates - Our floating rate financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include a 1.7 billion revolving credit facility and a 1.7 billion commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2024, we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility. An increase of 1 in interest rates on the 396 million outstanding under our commercial paper program as of September 30, 2024, would increase the interest expense on our debt by approximately 4 million on an annual basis. 
 
 Inflation - Macroeconomic factors have contributed, and we expect will continue to contribute, to increasing cost inflation for raw materials, components, supplies, and labor. We mitigate some cost inflation risk by negotiating long-term agreements with certain raw material suppliers and incorporating price escalation provisions in customer contracts to the extent possible. We include assumptions of anticipated cost growth in the development of our contract cost of completion estimates, but if inflationary conditions continue over the long-term, our cost assumptions may not be sufficient to cover all cost escalation or may impact the availability of resources to execute the respective contracts. Persistent cost inflation over the long-term may have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
