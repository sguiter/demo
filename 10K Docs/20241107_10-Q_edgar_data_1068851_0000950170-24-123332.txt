The investment securities portfolio is measured for expected credit losses by segregating the portfolio into general classifications and applying the appropriate expected credit losses methodology. Investment securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity are evaluated for expected credit losses under FASB ASC 326 , Financial Instruments Credit Losses. Available for sale securities . For available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position, the amount of the expected credit losses recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss. If an entity intends to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the expected credit losses will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period loss, the expected credit losses will be separated into the amount representing the credit-related portion of the impairment loss credit loss and the noncredit portion of the impairment loss noncredit portion ). The amount of the total expected credit losses related to the credit loss is determined based on the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis and such difference is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total expected credit losses related to the noncredit portion is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the expected credit losses recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment. As of September 30, 2024, management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale before a recovery of cost. In addition, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell any of its investment securities before a recovery of cost. The unrealized losses are largely due to changes in market interest rates and spread relationships since the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date, or if market yields for such investments decline. Management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, management believes that there is no potential for credit losses on available for sale securities. Held to maturity securities . The Company s held to maturity investments include mortgage-related bonds issued by either the Government National Mortgage Corporation Ginnie Mae ), Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac ). Ginnie Mae issued securities are explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issued securities are fully guaranteed by those respective United States government-sponsored agencies and conditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The Company s held to maturity securities also include taxable and tax-exempt municipal securities issued primarily by school districts, utility districts and municipalities located in Texas. The Company s investment in municipal securities is exposed to credit risk. The securities are highly rated by major rating agencies and regularly reviewed by management. A significant portion are guaranteed or insured by either the Texas Permanent School Fund, Assured Guaranty or Build America Mutual. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s municipal securities represent of the securities portfolio. Management has the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as held to maturity until they

Nonperforming Assets and Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans. The Company has several procedures in place to assist it in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio. The Company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers, including requiring appraisals on loans collateralized by real estate. The Company also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. Nevertheless, the Company s loan portfolio could become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions. The Company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when the payment of principal or interest is delinquent for 90 days, or earlier in some cases; unless the loan is in the process of collection and the underlying collateral fully supports the carrying value of the loan. A loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured, which is typically evidenced by a sustained period (at least six months) of repayment performance by the borrower.

Projected default rates, loss given default, and recovery rates for purchased credit deteriorated PCD loans primarily impact the related allowance, as opposed to the fair value mark. During the valuation process, the Company identified PCD and Non-PCD loans in the acquired loan portfolios. Loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination as of the acquisition date were accounted for as PCD. PCD loan identification considers the following factors: payment history and past due status, debt service coverage, loan grading, collateral values and other factors that may indicate deterioration of credit quality as of the acquisition date when compared to the origination date. Non-PCD loan identification considers the following factors: account types, remaining terms, annual interest rates or coupons, current market rates, interest types, past delinquencies, timing of principal and interest payments, loan to value ratios, loss exposures and remaining balances. Accretion of purchased discounts on PCD and Non-PCD loans will be recognized based on payment structure and the contractual maturity of individual loans.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. The allowance for credit losses is adjusted through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. Management has established an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate as of September 30, 2024 for estimated losses in the Company s loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is affected by the following: (1) charge-offs of loans that occur when loans are deemed uncollectible and decrease the allowance, (2) recoveries on loans previously charged off that increase the allowance, (3) provisions for credit losses charged to earnings that increase the allowance, and (4) provision releases returned to earnings that decrease the allowance. Based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio and consideration of the factors listed below, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the Bank s Board of Directors, indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for credit losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions or borrower performance differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations. The Company s allowance for credit losses on loans consists of two components: (1) a specific valuation allowance based on expected losses on specifically identified loans and (2) a general valuation allowance based on historical lifetime loan loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company.

 million or of total loans, including acquired loans with discounts, an increase of million or compared to the allowance for credit losses on loans totaling million or of total loans, including acquired loans with discounts, as of December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the merger of Lone Star State Bancshares, Inc. Lone Star into Bancshares and the subsequent merger of its wholly owned subsidiary Lone Star State Bank of West Texas Lone Star Bank into the Bank (collectively, the LSSB Merger on April 1, 2024. There was provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and a provision for credit losses of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As a result of the loans acquired in the LSSB Merger, the second quarter of 2024 included a million provision for credit losses on loans and a million provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures. Net charge-offs were million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net charge-offs of million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included million related to resolved PCD loans, which had specific reserves that were allocated to the charge-offs. Further, million of reserves on resolved PCD loans without any related charge-offs was released to the general reserve. Net charge-offs were million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included million related to resolved PCD loans, which had specific reserves that were allocated to the charge-offs. Additionally, reserves on PCD loans increased by million due to Day One accounting for PCD loans at the time of the LSSB Merger. Further, million of reserves on resolved PCD loans was released to the general reserve. Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which there is exposure to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, except when an obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance is adjusted by provisions for credit losses charged to earnings that increase the allowance, or by provision releases returned to earnings that decrease the allowance. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on the commitments expected to fund. The estimate of commitments expected to fund is affected by historical analysis of utilization rates. The expected credit loss rates applied to the commitments expected to fund are affected by the general valuation allowance utilized for outstanding balances with the same underlying assumptions and drivers. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had million and million in allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, respectively, with the increase due to the LSSB Merger. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is a separate line item on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had billion in commitments expected to fund.

Forward mortgage-backed securities trades 

Commercial loan interest rate swaps and caps: 

Loan customer counterparty 

Financial institution counterparty 

These financial instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and are used for asset and liability management and commercial customers financing needs. All derivatives are carried at fair value in either other assets or other liabilities, and all related cash flows are reported in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. Interest rate lock commitments IRLCs In the normal course of business, the Company enters into interest rate lock commitments with consumers to originate mortgage loans at a specified interest rate. These commitments, which contain fixed expiration dates, offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by the Company. Forward mortgage-backed securities trades The Company manages the changes in fair value associated with changes in interest rates related to IRLCs by using forward sold commitments known as forward mortgage-backed securities trades. These instruments are typically entered into at the time the interest rate lock commitment is made. Interest rate swaps and caps These derivative positions relate to transactions in which the Company enters into an interest rate swap or cap with a customer, while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap or cap with another financial institution. An interest rate swap transaction allows the Company s customer to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate. In connection with each swap, the Company agrees to pay interest to the customer on a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the customer on a similar notional amount at a fixed interest rate. At the same time, the Company agrees to pay another financial institution a similar fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive substantially the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount. In connection with each interest rate cap, the Company sells a cap to the customer and agrees to pay interest if the underlying index exceeds the strike price defined in the cap agreement. Simultaneously the Company purchases a cap with matching terms from another financial institution that agrees to pay the Company if the underlying index exceeds the strike price.

PROSPERITY BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 (UNAUDITED) 

The Company s credit exposure on interest rate swaps is limited to the net favorable value of all swaps by each counterparty, which was approximately thousand at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023 . This credit exposure is partly mitigated as transactions with customers are secured by the collateral, if any, securing the underlying transaction being hedged. The Company s credit exposure, net of collateral pledged, relating to interest rate swaps with upstream financial institution counterparties was thousand at September 30, 2024 . A credit support annex is in place and allows the Company to call collateral from upstream financial institution counterparties. Collateral levels are monitored and adjusted on a regular basis for changes in interest rate swap values. The Company s cash collateral pledged for interest rate swaps was at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The initial and subsequent changes in the fair value of IRLCs and the forward sales of mortgage-backed securities are recorded in net gain on sale of mortgage loans. These gains and losses were not attributable to instrument-specific credit risk. For interest rate swaps and caps, because the Company acts as an intermediary for its customer, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts substantially offset each other and do not have a material impact on its results of operations.

 OVERVIEW 
 Prosperity Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation Bancshares ), is a registered financial holding company that derives substantially all of its revenues and income from the operation of its bank subsidiary, Prosperity Bank (the Bank, and together with Bancshares, the Company ). The Bank provides a wide array of financial products and services to businesses and consumers throughout Texas and Oklahoma. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank operated 287 full-service banking locations: 65 in the Houston area, including The Woodlands; 30 in the South Texas area including Corpus Christi and Victoria; 62 in the Dallas/Fort Worth area; 22 in the East Texas area; 31 in the Central Texas area including Austin and San Antonio; 43 in the West Texas area including Lubbock, Midland-Odessa, Abilene; Amarillo and Wichita Falls; 15 in the Bryan/College Station area, 6 in the Central Oklahoma area; 8 in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area and 5 in the West Texas area currently doing business as Lone Star Bank. The Company s principal executive office is located at Prosperity Bank Plaza, 4295 San Felipe in Houston, Texas, and its telephone number is 
 36 

(281) 269-7199. The Company s website address is www.prosperitybankusa.com. Information contained on the Company s website is not incorporated by reference into this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and is not part of this or any other report. 
 The Company generates the majority of its revenues from interest income on loans, service charges and fees on customer accounts and income from investment in securities. The revenues are partially offset by interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings and noninterest expenses such as administrative and occupancy expenses. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is the Company s largest source of revenue. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and margin. 
 Three principal components of the Company s growth strategy are internal growth, efficient operations and acquisitions, including strategic merger transactions. The Company focuses on continual internal growth. The Company maintains separate data with respect to each banking center s net interest income, efficiency ratio, deposit growth and loan growth for purposes of measuring its overall profitability. The Company also focuses on maintaining efficiency and stringent cost control practices and policies. The Company has centralized many of its critical operations, such as data processing and loan processing. Management believes that this centralized infrastructure can accommodate substantial additional growth and achieve necessary controls while enabling the Company to minimize operational costs through certain economies of scale. The Company also intends to continue to seek expansion opportunities. 
 Total assets were 40.12 billion at September 30, 2024 compared with 38.55 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 1.57 billion or 4.1 . Total loans were 22.38 billion at September 30, 2024 compared with 21.18 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 1.20 billion or 5.7 . Total deposits were 28.09 billion at September 30, 2024 compared with 27.18 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 907.8 million or 3.3 . Total shareholders equity was 7.36 billion at September 30, 2024 compared with 7.08 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 281.9 million or 4.0 . 
 RECENT ACQUISITIONS 
 Merger of Lone Star State Bancshares, Inc. Effective April 1, 2024, the Company completed the merger of Lone Star State Bancshares, Inc. Lone Star into Bancshares and the subsequent merger of its wholly owned subsidiary Lone Star State Bank of West Texas Lone Star Bank ), into the Bank (collectively, the LSSB Merger ). Lone Star operated five full-service banking offices in the West Texas area, including its main office in Lubbock, and one banking center in each of Brownfield, Midland, Odessa and Big Spring, Texas. As of March 31, 2024, Lone Star, on a consolidated basis, reported total assets of 1.38 billion, total loans of 1.08 billion and total deposits of 1.24 billion. 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement, Bancshares issued 2,376,182 shares of its common stock plus approximately 64.1 million in cash for all outstanding shares of Lone Star. This resulted in goodwill of 108.0 million as of September 30, 2024, which does not include all the subsequent fair value adjustments that have not yet been finalized. Goodwill represents the excess of the total purchase price paid over the fair value of the assets acquired, net of the fair value of liabilities assumed. Additionally, the Company recognized 17.7 million of core deposit intangibles as of September 30, 2024. In October 2024, the Company completed the operational conversion of Lone Star Bank. 
 Merger of First Bancshares of Texas, Inc . Effective May 1, 2023, the Company completed the merger of First Bancshares of Texas, Inc. First Bancshares into Bancshares and the subsequent merger of its wholly owned subsidiary, FirstCapital Bank of Texas, N.A. FirstCapital Bank ), into the Bank (collectively, the FB Merger ). FirstCapital Bank operated 16 full-service banking offices in six different markets in West, North and Central Texas areas, including its main office in Midland, Texas, and banking offices in Midland, Lubbock, Amarillo, Wichita Falls, Burkburnett, Byers, Henrietta, Dallas, Horseshoe Bay, Marble Falls and Fredericksburg, Texas. As of March 31, 2023, First Bancshares, on a consolidated basis, reported total assets of 2.14 billion, total loans of 1.65 billion and total deposits of 1.71 billion. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement, Bancshares issued 3,583,370 shares of its common stock plus approximately 91.5 million in cash for all outstanding shares of First Bancshares capital stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recognized goodwill of 164.8 million, which includes all the final subsequent fair value adjustments. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company completed the operational conversion of FirstCapital Bank. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Estimates are made using 
 37 

facts and circumstances known at a point in time. Changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. The Company s accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity: 
 Business Combinations Generally, acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805, Business Combinations. A business combination occurs when the Company acquires net assets that constitute a business and obtains control over that business. Business combinations are effected through the transfer of consideration consisting of cash and/or common stock and are accounted for using the acquisition method. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, especially the loan portfolio, is a process involving significant judgment regarding methods and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair values. Fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values becomes available. The results of operations of an acquired entity are included in the Company s consolidated results from the acquisition date, and prior periods are not restated. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss CECL methodology. CECL requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected . The allowance for credit losses is an allowance available for losses on loans and held-to-maturity securities. The allowance for credit losses is adjusted through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. All losses are charged to the allowance when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that such a loss is likely and can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery. 
 The Company s allowance for credit losses consists of two elements: (1) specific valuation allowances based on expected losses on impaired loans and certain purchased credit-deteriorated loans PCD loans; and (2) a general valuation allowance based on historical lifetime loan loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company. Management has established an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate for estimated losses in the Company s loan portfolio. Based on an evaluation of the portfolio, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the Bank s Board of Directors, indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance. In making its evaluation, management considers factors such as historical lifetime loan loss experience, the amount of nonperforming assets and related collateral, the volume, growth and composition of the portfolio, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions that may affect borrower ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the portfolio through its internal loan review process and other relevant factors. Portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits; however, the entire allowance is available for any credit that, in management s judgment, should be charged off. Charge-offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible. Pursuant to the Company's adoption of ASU 2022-02 effective January 1, 2023, the Company prospectively discontinued troubled debt restructurings accounting and no longer measures the economic concession for loan modifications occurring on or after the adoption date. In addition, modifications to loans previously designated as troubled debt restructurings that occur on or after January 1, 2023, are accounted for under ASU 2022-02 and result in the elimination of any prior economic concession recorded in the allowance related to such loans. For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses on loans, see Accounting for Acquired Loans and the Allowance for Acquired Credit Losses below and Financial Condition Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans below. 
 Accounting for Acquired Loans and the Allowance for Acquired Credit Losses The Company accounts for its acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the assets, including loans, and liabilities of the acquired entity are recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value estimates associated with acquired loans, based on a discounted cash flow model, include estimates related to market interest rates and undiscounted projections of future cash flows that incorporate expectations of prepayments and the amount and timing of principal, interest and other cash flows, as well as any shortfalls thereof. For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses for acquired loans, see Financial Condition Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans below. For further discussion of the Company s acquisition and loan accounting, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net income available to common shareholders was 127.3 million or 1.34 per diluted common share compared with 112.2 million or 1.20 per diluted common share for the same period in 2023. The change was 
 38 

primarily due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense related to three months of Lone Star Bank operations. The Company posted annualized returns on average common equity of 6.93 and 6.39 , annualized returns on average assets of 1.28 and 1.13 and efficiency ratios of 46.87 and 48.74 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense (excluding net gains and losses on the sale, write down or write up of assets and securities) by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. Because the ratio is a measure of revenues and expenses resulting from the Company s lending activities and fee-based banking services, net gains and losses on the sale, write-up or write-down of assets and securities are not included. Additionally, taxes are not part of this calculation. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income available to common shareholders was 349.3 million or 3.68 per diluted common share compared with 323.8 million or 3.50 per diluted common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income and net income per diluted common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were impacted by an increase in net interest income, a gain on Visa Class B-1 stock exchange net of investment securities sales of 11.2 million, lower merger related provision for credit losses and a decrease in merger related expenses, partially offset by a FDIC special assessment of 3.6 million and an increase in noninterest expenses related to six months of Lone Star Bank operations and nine months of FirstCapital Bank operations. The Company posted annualized returns on average common equity of 6.40 and 6.25 , annualized returns on average assets of 1.16 and 1.11 and efficiency ratios of 49.25 and 48.50 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Net Interest Income 
 The Company s net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a volume change. It is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as a rate change. 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Net interest income before the provision for credit losses was 261.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 22.2 million or 9.3 compared with 239.5 million for the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to an increase in the average balances and average rates on loans, an increase in the average balances on federal funds sold and other earning assets and a decrease in the average balances and rate on other borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in the average balances on investment securities and an increase in the average balances and rates on interest-bearing deposits. 
 Interest income on loans was 337.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 28.8 million or 9.3 compared with 308.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was due to an increase in both the average balances and average rates on loans. 
 Interest income on securities was 59.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 10.4 million or 14.8 compared with 70.0 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in the average balances on investment securities. 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities were 22.39 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 408.7 million or 1.9 compared with 21.98 billion for the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest-earning deposits partially offset by a decrease in other borrowings and securities sold under repurchase agreements. The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities was 2.78 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 24 basis points compared with 2.54 for the same period in 2023. 
 The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis was 2.95 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 23 basis points compared with 2.72 for the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to an increase in the average balances and average rates on loans, an increase in the average balances on federal funds sold and other earning assets and a decrease in the average balances and rate on other borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in the average balances on investment securities and an increase in the average balances and rates on interest-bearing deposits. The increases in the average balances on loans and deposits were primarily due to the LSSB Merger. 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Net interest income before the provision for credit losses was 758.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 39.3 million or 5.5 compared with 719.5 million for the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to an increase in the average balances and average rates on loans, an increase in the average balances and average rates on federal funds sold and other earning assets, an increase in loan discount accretion and a decrease in the average rates on other borrowings, partially 
 39 

offset by a decrease in the average balances on investment securities and an increase in the average balances and rates on interest-bearing deposits. 
 Interest income on loans was 980.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 137.7 million or 16.3 compared with 842.4 million for the same period in 2023. The change was due to an increase in both the average balances and average rates on loans. 
 Interest income on securities was 188.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 26.8 million or 12.4 compared with 215.2 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in the average balances on investment securities. 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities were 22.59 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.05 billion or 4.9 compared with 21.55 billion for the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest-bearing deposits partially offset by a decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements and other borrowings. The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities was 2.68 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 52 basis points compared with 2.16 for the same period in 2023. 
 The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis was 2.86 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 7 basis points compared with 2.79 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to an increase in the average balances and average rates on loans, an increase in the average balances and average rates on federal funds sold and other earning assets, an increase in loan discount accretion and a decrease in the average rates on other borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in the average balances on investment securities and an increase in the average balances and rates on interest-bearing deposits. The increases in the average balances on loans and deposits were primarily due to the LSSB Merger and FB Merger.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 Management actively monitors the Company s asset quality and provides specific loss provisions when necessary. Provisions for credit losses are charged to income to bring the total allowance for credit losses on loans and off-balance sheet credit exposures to a level deemed appropriate by management of the Company based on such factors as historical lifetime credit loss experience, the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral, the volume growth and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions that may affect borrower ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the loan portfolio through the internal loan review process and other relevant factors. 
 Loans are charged off against the allowance for credit losses when appropriate. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the provision for credit losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations. 
 There was no provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The provision for credit losses was 9.1 million and 18.5 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As a result of the loans acquired in the LSSB Merger, the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a 7.9 million provision for credit losses on loans and a 1.2 million provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures. 
 Net charge-offs were 5.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared with net charge-offs of 3.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 1.4 million related to resolved PCD loans, which had specific reserves that were allocated to the charge-offs. Further, 5.0 million of reserves on resolved PCD loans without any related charge-offs was released to the general reserve. 
 43 

Net charge-offs were 12.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 18.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 3.3 million related to resolved PCD loans, which had specific reserves that were allocated to the charge-offs. Additionally, reserves on PCD loans increased by 26.1 million due to Day One accounting for PCD loans at the time of the LSSB Merger. Further, 13.9 million of reserves on resolved PCD loans was released to the general reserve. 
 Noninterest Income 
 The Company s primary sources of recurring noninterest income are credit, debit and ATM card income, nonsufficient funds fees and service charges on deposit accounts. Additionally, the Company generates recurring noninterest income from its various additional products and services, including trust services, mortgage lending, brokerage and independent sales organization sponsorship operations. Noninterest income does not include loan origination fees, which are recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest method. 
 Noninterest income totaled 41.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 38.7 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 2.4 million or 6.1 , primarily due to the increase in the net gain (loss) on sale or write-down of assets, partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled 126.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 116.7 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 9.3 million or 7.9 , primarily due to a gain on Visa Class B-1 stock exchange net of investment securities sales and, an increase in trust income, partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest income.

Noninterest Expense 
 Noninterest expense totaled 140.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared with 135.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.7 million or 3.5 , primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits, an increase in credit and debit card, data processing and software amortization, and additional expenses related to three months of Lone Star Bank operations, partially offset by a decrease in merger related expenses. Noninterest expense totaled 429.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 404.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 24.5 million or 6.1 , primarily due to a FDIC special assessment of 3.6 million, an increase in salaries and benefits and additional expenses related to six months of Lone Star Bank operations and nine months of FirstCapital Bank operations, partially offset by a decrease in merger related expenses.

Income tax expense totaled 35.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 30.4 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 4.8 million or 15.7 . Income tax expense totaled 97.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 89.2 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 8.0 million or 9.0 . The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 21.6 and 21.3 , respectively. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 21.8 and 21.6 , respectively. 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Loan Portfolio 
 The Company separates its loan portfolio into two general categories of loans: (1) originated loans, which are loans originated by the Company and made pursuant to the Company s loan policy and procedures in effect at the time the loan was made, and (2) acquired loans, which are loans acquired in a business combination and recorded at fair value at acquisition date. Those acquired loans that are renewed or substantially modified after the date of the business combination are referred to as re-underwritten acquired loans. If a renewal or substantial modification of an acquired loan is underwritten by the Company with a new credit analysis, the loan may no longer be categorized as an acquired loan. For example, acquired loans to one borrower may be combined into a new loan with a new loan number and categorized as an originated loan. Acquired loans with a fair value discount or premium at the date of the business combination that remained at the reporting date are referred to as fair-valued acquired loans. All fair-valued acquired loans are further categorized into PCD loans and Non-PCD loans. Acquired loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the acquisition date when compared to the origination date are classified as PCD loans. 
 45 

The following tables summarize the Company s originated and acquired loan portfolios broken out into originated loans, re-underwritten acquired loans, Non-PCD loans and PCD loans, as of the dates indicated.

 46 

The loan portfolio consists of various types of loans categorized by major type as follows: 
 (i) Commercial and Industrial Loans. In nearly all cases, the Company s commercial loans are made in the Company s market areas and are underwritten based on the borrower s ability to service the debt from income. Working capital loans are primarily collateralized by short-term assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by long-term assets. As a general practice, term loans are secured by any available real estate, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower. Both working capital and term loans are typically supported by a personal guaranty of a principal. In general, commercial loans involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans and, therefore, usually yield a higher return. The increased risk in commercial loans is due to the type of collateral securing these loans as well as the expectation that commercial loans generally will be serviced principally from the operations of the business, and those operations may not be successful. Historical trends have shown these types of loans to have higher delinquencies than mortgage loans. As a result of these additional complexities, variables and risks, commercial loans require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types of loans. 
 Included in commercial and industrial loans are (1) commitments to oil and gas producers largely secured by proven, developed and producing reserves and (2) commitments to service, equipment and midstream companies secured mainly by accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Mineral reserve values supporting commitments to producers are normally re-determined semi-annually using reserve studies prepared by a third-party or the Company s oil and gas engineer. Accounts receivable and inventory borrowing bases for service companies are typically re-determined monthly. Funding requests by both producers and service companies are monitored relative to the most recently determined borrowing base. 
 (ii) Commercial Real Estate. The Company makes commercial real estate loans collateralized by owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied real estate to finance the purchase of real estate. The Company s commercial real estate loans are collateralized by first liens on real estate, typically have variable interest rates (or five year or less fixed rates) and amortize over a 15- to 25-year period. Payments on loans secured by nonowner-occupied properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than other types of loans. The Company seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, including giving careful consideration to the property s operating history, future operating projections, current and projected occupancy, location and physical condition, in connection with underwriting these loans. The underwriting analysis also includes credit verification, analysis of global cash flow, appraisals and a review of the financial condition of the borrower and guarantor. Loans to hotels and restaurants are included in commercial real estate loans. 
 (iii) 1-4 Family Residential Loans. The Company s lending activities also include the origination of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans (including home equity loans) collateralized by owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied residential properties located in the Company s market areas. The Company offers a variety of mortgage loan portfolio products which generally are amortized over five to 30 years. Loans collateralized by 1-4 family residential real estate generally have been originated in amounts of no more than 89 of appraised value. The Company requires mortgage title insurance, as well as hazard, wind and/or flood insurance as appropriate. The Company prefers to retain residential mortgage loans for its own account rather than selling them into the secondary market. By doing so, the Company incurs interest rate risk as well as the risks associated with non-payments on such loans. The Company s mortgage department also offers a variety of mortgage loan products which are generally amortized over 30 years, including FHA and VA loans, which are sold to secondary market investors. 
 (iv) Construction, Land Development and Other Land Loans. The Company makes loans to finance the construction of residential and nonresidential properties. Construction loans generally are collateralized by first liens on real estate and have variable interest rates. The Company conducts periodic inspections, either directly or through an agent, prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans. Underwriting guidelines similar to those described above are also used in the Company s construction lending activities, with heightened analysis of construction and/or development costs. Construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction, and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio. As a result of these uncertainties, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If the Company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, the Company may not be able to recover all of the unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, the Company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time. Although the Company has underwriting procedures designed to identify what it believes to be acceptable levels of risks in construction lending, these procedures may not prevent losses from the risks described above. 
 47 

(v) Warehouse Purchase Program . The Warehouse Purchase Program allows unaffiliated mortgage originators Clients to close 1-4 family real estate loans in their own name and manage their cash flow needs until the loans are sold to investors. The Company s Clients are strategically targeted for their experienced management teams and analyzed for the expected profitability of each Client s business model over the long term. The Clients are located across the U.S. and originate mortgage loans primarily through traditional retail and/or wholesale business models using underwriting standards as required by United States government-sponsored enterprise agencies, Agencies such as the Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae ), private investors to which the mortgage loans are ultimately sold and/or mortgage insurers. 
 Although not subject to any legally binding commitment, when the Company makes a purchase decision, it acquires a 100 participation interest in the mortgage loans originated by its Clients. Individual mortgage loans are warehoused in the Company s portfolio only for a short duration, averaging less than 30 days. When instructed by a Client that a warehoused loan has been sold to an investor, the Company delivers the note to the investor that pays the Company, which in turn remits the net sales proceeds to the Client. 
 (vi) Agriculture Loans. The Company provides agriculture loans for short-term livestock and crop production, including rice, cotton, milo and corn, farm equipment financing and agriculture real estate financing. The Company evaluates agriculture borrowers primarily based on their historical profitability, level of experience in their particular industry segment, overall financial capacity and the availability of secondary collateral to withstand economic and natural variations common to the industry. Because agriculture loans present a higher level of risk associated with events caused by nature, the Company routinely makes on-site visits and inspections in order to identify and monitor such risks. 
 (vii) Consumer Loans. Consumer loans made by the Company include direct A -credit automobile loans, recreational vehicle loans, boat loans, home improvement loans, personal loans (collateralized and uncollateralized) and deposit account collateralized loans. The terms of these loans typically range from 12 to 180 months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan. Generally, consumer loans entail greater risk than do real estate secured loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or collateralized by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, personal bankruptcy or death. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. 
 The Company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as the Company s policies and procedures. 
 Nonperforming Assets 
 Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, repossessed assets and real estate which has been acquired through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition. Nonperforming assets do not include PCD loans unless the loan has deteriorated since the acquisition date. 
 The Company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when the payment of principal or interest is delinquent for 90 days, or earlier in some cases, unless the loan is in the process of collection and the underlying collateral fully supports the carrying value of the loan. A loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured, which is typically evidenced by a sustained period (at least six months) of repayment performance by the borrower. 
 Nonperforming assets increased 17.3 million to 89.9 million at September 30, 2024 compared with 72.7 million at December 31, 2023, with a significant portion of the balance for each period attributable to acquired loans.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 The allowance for credit losses is adjusted through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. Management has established an allowance for credit losses on loans which it believes is adequate as of September 30, 2024 for estimated losses in the Company s loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is affected by the following: (1) charge-offs of loans that occur when loans are deemed uncollectible and decrease the allowance, (2) recoveries on loans previously charged off that increase the allowance, (3) provisions for credit losses charged to earnings that increase the allowance, and (4) provision releases returned to earnings that decrease the allowance. Based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio and consideration of the factors listed below, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the Bank s Board of Directors, indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for credit losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions or borrower performance differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations. 
 The Company s allowance for credit losses on loans consists of two components: (1) a specific valuation allowance based on expected lifetime losses on specifically identified loans and (2) a general valuation allowance based on historical lifetime loan loss experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company. 
 In setting the specific valuation allowance, the Company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the total loan portfolio and assigns risk grades to each loan. Through this loan review process, the Company maintains an internal list of impaired loans which, along with the delinquency list of loans, helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. All loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific reserve is required. For certain impaired loans, the Company allocates a specific loan loss reserve primarily based on the value of the collateral securing the impaired loan. The specific reserves are determined on an individual loan basis. Loans for which specific reserves are provided are excluded from the general valuation allowance described below. 
 In determining the amount of the general valuation allowance, management considers factors such as historical lifetime loan loss experience, concentration risk of specific loan types, the volume, growth and composition of the Company s loan portfolio, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions that may affect borrower ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the Company s loan portfolio through its internal loan review process, other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company and other relevant factors. Historical lifetime loan loss experience is determined by utilizing an open-pool cumulative loss rate methodology. Adjustments to the historical lifetime loan loss experience are made for differences in current loan pool risk characteristics such as portfolio concentrations, delinquency, non-accrual, and watch list levels, as well as changes in current and forecasted economic conditions such as unemployment rates, property and collateral values, and other indices relating to economic activity. The utilization of reasonable and supportable forecasts includes an immediate reversion to lifetime historical loss rates. Based on a review of these factors for each loan type, the Company applies an estimated percentage to the outstanding balance of each loan type, excluding any loan that has a specific reserve. Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories. 
 A change in the allowance for credit losses can be attributable to several factors, most notably (1) specific reserves identified for impaired loans, (2) historical lifetime credit loss information, (3) changes in current and forecasted environmental factors and (4) growth in the balance of loans. 
 Changes in the Company s asset quality are reflected in the allowance in several ways. Specific reserves that are calculated on a loan-by-loan basis and the qualitative assessment of all other loans reflect current changes in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. Historical lifetime credit losses, on the other hand, are based on an open-pool cumulative loss rate methodology, which is then applied to estimate lifetime credit losses in the loan portfolio. A deterioration in the credit quality of the loan portfolio in the current period would increase the historical lifetime loss rate to be applied in future periods, just as an improvement in credit quality would decrease the historical lifetime loss rate. 
 50 

The allowance for credit losses is further determined by the size of the loan portfolio subject to the allowance methodology and environmental factors that include Company-specific risk indicators and general economic conditions, both of which are constantly changing. The Company evaluates the economic and portfolio-specific factors on a quarterly basis to determine a qualitative component of the general valuation allowance. The factors include current economic metrics, reasonable and supportable forecasted economic metrics, business conditions, delinquency trends, credit concentrations, nature and volume of the portfolio and other adjustments for items not covered by specific reserves and historical lifetime loss experience. Management s assessment of qualitative factors is a statistically based approach to determine the loss rate adjustment associated with such factors. Based on the Company s actual historical lifetime loan loss experience relative to economic and loan portfolio-specific factors at the time the losses occurred, management is able to identify the expected level of lifetime losses as of the date of measurement. The correlation of historical loss experience with current and forecasted economic conditions provides an estimate of lifetime losses that has not been previously factored into the general valuation allowance by the determination of specific reserves and lifetime historical losses. Additionally, the Company considers qualitative factors not easily quantified and the possibility of model imprecision. 
 Utilizing the aggregation of specific reserves, historical loss experience and a qualitative component, management is able to determine the valuation allowance to reflect the full lifetime loss. 
 The Company accounts for its acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the assets, including loans, and liabilities of the acquired entity are recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date. These fair value estimates associated with acquired loans, and based on a discounted cash flow model, include estimates related to market interest rates and undiscounted projections of future cash flows that incorporate expectations of prepayments and the amount and timing of principal, interest and other cash flows, as well as any shortfalls thereof. 
 Non-PCD loans that were not deemed impaired subsequent to the acquisition date are considered non-impaired and are evaluated as part of the general valuation allowance. 
 Non-PCD loans that have deteriorated to an impaired status subsequent to acquisition are evaluated for a specific reserve on a quarterly basis which, when identified, is added to the allowance for credit losses. The Company reviews impaired Non-PCD loans on a loan-by-loan basis and determines the specific reserve based on the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and one of three factors: expected future cash flows, observable market price or fair value of the collateral. Because essentially all of the Company s impaired Non-PCD loans have been collateral-dependent, the amount of the specific reserve historically has been determined by comparing the fair value of the collateral securing the Non-PCD loan with the recorded investment in such loan. In the future, the Company will continue to analyze impaired Non-PCD loans on a loan-by-loan basis and may use an alternative measurement method to determine the specific reserve, as appropriate and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 
 PCD loans are monitored individually or on a pooled basis quarterly to assess for changes in expected cash flows subsequent to acquisition. If a deterioration in cash flows is identified, an increase to the PCD reserves for that individual loan or pool of loans is made. PCD loans were recorded at their acquisition date fair values, which were based on expected cash flows and considers estimates of expected future credit losses. The Company s estimates of loan fair values at the acquisition date may be adjusted for a period of up to one year as the Company continues to evaluate its estimate of expected future cash flows at the acquisition date. If the Company determines that losses arose after the acquisition date, the additional losses will be reflected as a provision for credit losses. See Critical Accounting Estimates above for more information. 
 As described in the section captioned Critical Accounting Estimates above, the Company s determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. The Company s analysis of qualitative, or environmental, factors on pools of loans with common risk characteristics, in combination with the quantitative historical lifetime loss information and specific reserves, provides the Company with an estimate of lifetime losses. The allowance must reflect changes in the balance of loans subject to the allowance methodology, as well as the estimated lifetime losses associated with those loans.

The allowance for credit losses on loans totaled 354.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared with 332.4 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 22.0 million or 6.6 , primarily due to the LSSB Merger. The allowance for credit losses on loans totaled 1.58 of total loans at September 30, 2024 and 1.57 of total loans at December 31, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, 227.2 million of the allowance for credit losses on loans was attributable to originated loans, an increase of 4.8 million or 2.2 compared with 222.4 million of the allowance at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, 29.5 million of the allowance for credit losses on loans was attributable to re-underwritten acquired loans compared with 30.0 million of the allowance at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 409 thousand or 1.4 . At September 30, 2024, 28.6 million of the allowance for credit losses on loans was attributable to Non-PCD loans compared with 22.3 million of the allowance at December 31, 2023, an increase of 6.3 million or 28.1 . At September 30, 2024, 69.0 million of the allowance for credit losses on loans was attributable to PCD loans compared with 57.7 million of the allowance at December 31, 2023, an increase of 11.3 million or 19.7 . 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had 38.9 million of total outstanding accretable discounts on Non-PCD loans and PCD loans. The Company believes that the allowance for credit losses on loans at September 30, 2024 is adequate to absorb expected lifetime losses that may be realized from the loan portfolio as of such date. Nevertheless, the Company could sustain losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance at September 30, 2024. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures 
 The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which there is exposure to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, except when an obligation is unconditionally cancelable by the Company. The allowance is adjusted by provisions for credit losses charged to earnings that increase the allowance, or by provision releases returned to earnings that decrease the allowance. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on the commitments expected to fund. The estimate of commitments expected to fund is affected by historical analysis of utilization rates. The expected credit loss rates applied to the commitments expected to fund are affected by the general valuation allowance utilized for outstanding balances with the same underlying assumptions and drivers. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 37.6 million and 36.5 million, respectively, in allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, with the increase due to the LSSB Merger. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is a separate line item on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. 
 The following table represents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures as of the dates indicated.

The investment securities portfolio is measured for expected credit losses by segregating the portfolio into two general classifications and applying the appropriate expected credit losses methodology. Investment securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity are evaluated for expected credit losses under FASB ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses . 
 
 Available for sale securities . For available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position, the amount of the expected credit losses recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss. If an entity intends to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the expected credit losses will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period loss, the expected credit losses will be separated into the amount representing the credit-related portion of the impairment loss credit loss and the noncredit portion of the impairment loss noncredit portion ). The amount of the total expected credit losses related to the credit loss is determined based on the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis, and such difference is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total expected credit losses related to the noncredit portion is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the expected credit losses recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment. 
 55 

As of September 30, 2024, management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale before a recovery of cost. In addition, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell any of its investment securities before a recovery of cost. The unrealized losses are largely due to changes in market interest rates and spread relationships since the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, management believes that there is no potential for credit losses on available for sale securities. 
 
 Held to maturity securities . The Company s held to maturity investments include mortgage-related bonds issued by either the Government National Mortgage Corporation Ginnie Mae ), Fannie Mae or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac ). Ginnie Mae issued securities are explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issued securities are fully guaranteed by those respective United States government-sponsored agencies, and conditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The Company s held to maturity securities also include taxable and tax-exempt municipal securities issued primarily by school districts, utility districts and municipalities located in Texas. The Company s investment in municipal securities is exposed to credit risk. The securities are highly rated by major rating agencies and regularly reviewed by management. A significant portion are guaranteed or insured by either the Texas Permanent School Fund, Assured Guaranty or Build America Mutual. As of September 30, 2024 the Company s municipal securities represent 0.8 of the securities portfolio. Management has the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as held to maturity until they mature, at which time the Company will receive full value for the securities. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, management believes that there is no potential for material credit losses on held to maturity securities. 
 Visa Class B-1 Stock Exchange . During the second quarter of 2024, the Bank tendered all of its shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock in exchange for a combination of Visa Class B-2 common stock and Visa Class C common stock, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the public offering of Visa to exchange its Class B-1 common stock for a combination of shares of its Class B-2 common stock and Class C common stock, which expired on May 3, 2024. The Company recorded a gain of 20.6 million during the second quarter of 2024 based on the conversion privilege of the Class C common stock and the closing price of Visa Class A common stock. In the exchange, the Bank received 48,492 shares of Class B-2 stock, recorded at zero cost basis, and 19,245 shares of Class C common stock and has subsequently sold all shares of Class C stock. 
 Deposits 
 Total deposits were 28.09 billion at September 30, 2024 compared with 27.18 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 907.8 million or 3.3 . Total noninterest-bearing deposits were 9.81 billion at September 30, 2024 compared with 9.78 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 34.8 million or 0.4 . Interest-bearing deposits were 18.28 billion at September 30, 2024 compared with 17.40 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 873.0 million or 5.0 . The increases were primarily due to the LSSB Merger. 
 Average deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 28.13 billion, an increase of 690.7 million or 2.5 compared with 27.43 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The ratio of average interest-bearing deposits to total average deposits was 65.3 and 62.4 during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Bank Term Funding Program During the second quarter of 2023, the Bank began participating in the Federal Reserve s Bank Term Funding Program BTFP ), which ceased extending new loans as of March 11, 2024. Under the BTFP program, eligible depository institutions could obtain loans of up to one year in length by pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral. The pledged assets are valued at par totaling 4.03 billion at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the balance outstanding was 3.90 billion consisting of a one-term advance maturing in January 2025 with an interest rate of 4.76 , collateralized by the par value of pledged securities. 
 
 FHLB advances and long-term notes payable The Company has an available line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas FHLB ), which allows the Company to borrow on a collateralized basis. The Company s FHLB advances are typically considered short-term borrowings and are used to manage liquidity as needed. Maturing advances are replaced by drawing on available cash, making additional borrowings or through increased customer deposits. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total borrowing capacity of 8.13 billion under this line. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no FHLB advances or long-term notes payable balance outstanding. 
 Securities sold under repurchase agreements At September 30, 2024, the Company had 228.9 million in securities sold under repurchase agreements with banking customers compared with 309.3 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 80.4 million or 26.0 . Repurchase agreements are generally settled on the following business day; however, approximately 3.0 million of the repurchase agreements outstanding at September 30, 2024 have maturity dates ranging from 12 to 24 months. All securities sold under repurchase agreements are collateralized by certain pledged securities. 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity involves the Company s ability to raise funds to support asset growth and acquisitions or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations, to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate the Company on an ongoing basis and manage unexpected events. The Company s largest source of funds is deposits and its largest use of funds is loans. The Company does not expect a change in the source or use of its funds in the future. Although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities, the Company does not generally rely on this external funding source. The cash and federal funds sold position, supplemented by amortizing investment and loan portfolios, has generally created an adequate liquidity position. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding 4.04 billion in commitments to extend credit, 90.1 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit and 752.5 million in commitments associated with unused 
 57 

capacity on Warehouse Purchase Program loans. Since commitments associated with letters of credit, unused capacity on Warehouse Purchase Program loans and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the total outstanding may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 
 The Company has no exposure to future cash requirements associated with known uncertainties or capital expenditures of a material nature. 
 Asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable or which will mature in the near future. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 2.21 billion compared with 458.4 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 1.75 billion or 382.1 . The increase was primarily due to net proceeds from maturities, sales and principal paydowns of investment securities of 1.54 billion, net cash provided by operating activities of 678.5 million, net cash provided by the purchase of Lone Star of 169.9 million and net proceeds from other short-term borrowings of 175.0 million, partially offset by net decrease in deposits of 332.5 million, net increase in loans of 154.9 million, payment of cash dividends of 159.1 million, net decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements of 80.4 million and repurchase of common stock of 74.8 million. 
 Share Repurchases 
 On January 16, 2024, Bancshares announced a stock repurchase program under which it could repurchase up to 5 , or approximately 4.7 million shares, of its outstanding common stock over a one-year period expiring on January 16, 2025, at the discretion of management. Under the stock repurchase program, Bancshares may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open-market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions. Repurchases under this program may also be made in transactions outside the safe harbor during a pending merger, acquisition or similar transaction. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions, and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. Shares of stock repurchased are held as authorized but unissued shares. Bancshares is not obligated to purchase any particular number of shares, and Bancshares may suspend, modify or terminate the program at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Under its 2024 stock repurchase program, Bancshares repurchased zero shares of its common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 1.2 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of 60.35 per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The Company s contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments (other than deposit obligations and securities sold under repurchase agreements) as of September 30, 2024 are summarized below. 
 Bank Term Funding Program 
 The Company s future cash payments associated with the Federal Reserve s BTFP as of September 30, 2024 are summarized below. The future interest payments were calculated using the current rate in effect at September 30, 2024. Payments under the BTFP include interest of 186.1 million that will be due over the future periods. These payments do not include prepayment options that may be available to the Company.

Leases 
 The Company s leases relate primarily to operating leases for office space and banking centers. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. The Company s leases have remaining lease terms of 1 to 15 years, which may include the option to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain for the Company to exercise that option. Operating lease right-of-use ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental collateralized borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease payments. Short-term leases and leases with variable lease costs are immaterial, and the Company has one sublease arrangement. Sublease income was 826 thousand and 816 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and 2.5 million and 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities were approximately 35.5 million. ROU assets and lease liabilities were classified as other assets and other liabilities, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average of remaining lease terms of the Company s operating leases was 5.9 years. The weighted average discount rate used to determine the lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 for the Company s operating leases was 3.0 . Cash paid for the Company s operating leases was 2.9 million and 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 8.7 million and 9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company obtained 5.2 million in ROU assets in exchange for lease liabilities for three operating leases. 
 The Company s future undiscounted cash payments associated with its operating leases as of September 30, 2024 are summarized below (dollars in thousands).

Off-Balance Sheet Items 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company enters into these transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 The Company s commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit, unused capacity on Warehouse Purchase Program loans and commitments to extend credit expiring by period as of September 30, 2024 are summarized below. Since commitments associated with letters of credit, unused capacity on Warehouse Purchase Program loans and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the amounts shown may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-balance Sheet Credit Exposures . The Company records an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposure that is adjusted through a charge to provision for credit losses on the Company s consolidated statement of income. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, this allowance, reported as a separate line item on the Company s consolidated balance sheet, totaled 37.6 million and 36.5 million, respectively. The increase in the allowance was due to the LSSB Merger. 
 59 

Capital Resources 
 Total shareholders equity was 7.36 billion at September 30, 2024 compared with 7.08 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 281.9 million or 4.0 . The increase was primarily the result of the common stock issuance in connection with the LSSB Merger of 156.3 million and net income of 349.3 million, partially offset by dividend payments of 159.1 million and common stock repurchases of 74.8 million. 
 The Basel III Capital Rules, effective for the Company on January 1, 2015, substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank. The Basel III Capital Rules require a 2.5 capital conservation buffer with respect to each of the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios, which provides for capital levels that exceed the minimum risk-based capital adequacy requirements. A financial institution with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount will be subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020 the joint federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that allowed banking organizations that implemented CECL in 2020 to mitigate the effects of the CECL accounting standard in their regulatory capital for two years. This two-year delay is in addition to the three-year transition period that the agencies had already made available. The Company adopted the option provided by the interim final rule, which delayed the effects of CECL on its regulatory capital through 2021, after which the effects will be phased in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. Under the interim final rule, the amount of adjustments to regulatory capital deferred until the phase-in period include both the initial impact of the Company s adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 and 25 of subsequent changes in the Company s allowance for credit losses during each quarter of the two-year period ending December 31, 2021. The cumulative amount of the transition adjustments is being phased in over the three-year transition period that began on January 1, 2022, with 75 recognized in 2022, 50 recognized in 2023, and 25 recognized in 2024. 
 Financial institutions are categorized by the FDIC based on minimum Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s capital ratios were above the levels required for the Bank to be designated as well capitalized. 
 The following table provides a comparison of the Company s and the Bank s risk-weighted and leverage capital ratios to the minimum and well-capitalized regulatory standards as of September 30, 2024:

 The Company manages market risk, which for the Company is primarily interest rate risk, through its Asset Liability Committee consisting of senior officers of the Company, in accordance with policies approved by the Company s Board of Directors. 
 The Company uses simulation analysis to examine the potential effects of market changes on net interest income and market value. The Company considers macroeconomic variables, Company strategy, liquidity and other factors as it quantifies market risk. See Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed on February 28, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K ), for further discussion.
