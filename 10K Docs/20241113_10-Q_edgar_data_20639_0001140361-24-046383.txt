 the litigation funder would receive back their initial funding amount first (i.e. before any recovery is received by the Company), plus an additional multiple ranging from times to times the amount funded (depending on various

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Cautionary Statement for Forward-Looking Information

This quarterly report together with other statements and information publicly disseminated by the Company may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of
 1933, as amended (the Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), or make oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements. The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be
 covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which cannot be
 predicted or quantified. The forward-looking statements may relate to such matters as anticipated financial performance, future revenues or earnings, business prospects, projected ventures, anticipated market performance, anticipated litigation
 results or the timing of pending litigation, and similar matters. When used in this Quarterly Report, the words estimates, expects, anticipates, believes, plans, intends and variations of such words and similar expressions are
 intended to identify forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company cautions readers that a variety of factors could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other
 expectations expressed in the Company s forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company s control, include, but are not limited to those set forth in Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in the
 Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Company s other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including, but not limited to: (i) risks with regard to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern; (ii)
 assumptions regarding the outcome of legal and/or tax matters, based in whole or in part upon consultation with outside advisors; (iii) risks arising from unfavorable decisions in tax, legal and/or other proceedings; (iv) transaction volume in
 the securities markets; (v) the volatility of the securities markets; (vi) fluctuations in interest rates; (vii) risks inherent in the real estate business, including, but not limited to, insurance risks, tenant defaults, risks associated with
 real estate development activities, changes in occupancy rates or real estate values; (viii) changes in regulatory requirements which could affect the cost of doing business; (ix) general economic conditions; (x) risks with regard to whether or
 not the Company s current financial resources will be adequate to fund operations over the next twelve months from financial statement issuance date and/or continue operations; (xi) changes in the rate of inflation and the related impact on the
 securities markets; (xii) changes in federal and state tax laws and (xiii) additionally, there is risk relating to assumptions regarding the outcome of tax matters, based in whole or in part upon
 consultation with outside advisors; risk relating to potential unfavorable decisions in tax proceedings; risks regarding changes in, and/or interpretations of federal and state income tax laws; and risk of IRS and/or state tax authority
 assessment of additional tax plus interest. These are not the only risks that we face. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business and financial
 position.

Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which are applicable only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements
 to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this Quarterly Report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the Company s expectations will be realized.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which follows, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are
 contained in Part I - Item 1, herein and in Part II Item 8 in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

AmBase Corporation (the Company or AmBase is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1975. AmBase is a holding company. At September 30, 2024, the Company s assets consisted primarily of cash and
 cash equivalents. The Company is engaged in the management of its assets and liabilities.

In June 2013, the Company purchased an equity interest in a real estate development property through a joint venture agreement to purchase and develop real property located at 105 through 111 West 57 th Street in New York, New York (the 111 West 57 th Property ). The Company is
 engaged in material disputes and litigation with regard to the 111 West 57 th Property. Despite ongoing litigation challenging the legitimacy of the actions taken
 in connection with the Strict Foreclosure , (as defined and further discussed herein), the Company recorded an impairment for the full amount of its equity investment in the 111 West 57th Property in 2017. Prior to the Strict Foreclosure, the
 carrying value of the Company s equity investment in the 111 West 57 th Property represented a substantial portion of the Company s assets and net equity value.

20 

Table of Contents 

For additional information concerning the Company s recording of an impairment of its equity investment in the 111 West 57 th 
 Property in 2017 and the Company s legal proceedings relating to the 111 West 57 th Property, including the Company s challenge to the Strict Foreclosure, see Part I Item 1 Note 3 and Note 6 to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

The Company s assets at September 30, 2024, aggregated 515,000 consisting of cash and cash equivalents of 515,000. At September 30, 2024, the Company s liabilities aggregated 3,327,000. Total stockholders 
 deficit was 2,812,000.

A fundamental principle of the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP is the assumption that an entity will continue in existence as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of
 operations and the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities occurring in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with this requirement, the Company has prepared its accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
 statements assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.

The Company has incurred operating losses and used cash for operating activities for the past several years. The Company has continued to keep operating expenses at a reduced level; however, there can be no
 assurance that the Company s current level of operating expenses will not increase or that other uses of cash will not be necessary. The Company believes that based on its current level of operating expenses, its existing cash and cash
 equivalents may not be sufficient to cover operating cash needs through the twelve month period from the financial statement reporting date. Based on the above factors, management determined there is substantial doubt about the Company s
 ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as
 a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities, which might be necessary should the Company not continue in operation.

In order to continue as a going concern, the Company must take steps to manage its current level of cash and cash equivalents, through various ways, including but not limited to, raising additional capital
 through the sale of equity or debt securities or long-term borrowings, which may include additional borrowings from affiliates of the Company, litigation funding agreements, reducing operating expenses, and seeking recoveries from various
 sources. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to adequately implement these cash management measures, in whole or in part or raise capital or obtain financing on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.

In June 2013, the Company purchased an equity interest in the 111 West 57 th Property. The Company is engaged in material disputes
 and litigation with regard to the 111 West 57 th Property. Despite ongoing litigation challenging the legitimacy of the actions taken in connection with the Strict
 Foreclosure , (as defined and further discussed herein), in accordance with GAAP, the Company recorded an impairment for the full amount of its equity investment in the 111 West 57th Property of 63,745,000 in 2017. Prior to the Strict
 Foreclosure, the carrying value of the Company s equity investment in the 111 West 57 th Property represented a substantial portion of the Company s assets and net
 equity value.

For additional information concerning the Company s recording of an impairment of its equity investment in the 111 West 57 th 
 Property and the Company s legal proceedings relating to the 111 West 57 th Property, including the Company s challenge to the Strict Foreclosure, see Part I Item 1 Note 3 and Note 6 to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

With respect to its disputes and litigation relating to its interest in the 111 West 57th Property, the Company is pursuing, and will continue to pursue, other options to realize the Company s investment value,
 various legal courses of action to protect its legal rights, recovery of its asset value from various sources of recovery, as well as considering other possible economic strategies, including the possible sale of the Company s interest in
 and/or rights with respect to the 111 West 57 th Property; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail with respect to any of its claims.

The Company can give no assurances regarding the outcome of the matters described herein, including as to the effect of Spruce s actions described herein, whether the Sponsors will perform their contractual
 commitments to the Company under the JV Agreement, as to what further action, if any, the lenders may take with respect to the project, as to the ultimate resolution of the ongoing litigation proceedings relating to the Company s investment
 interest in the 111 West 57 th Property, as to the ultimate effect of the Sponsors , the Company s or the lenders actions on the project, as to the completion or
 ultimate success of the project, or as to the value or ultimate realization of any portion of the Company s equity investment in the 111 West 57 th Street. For
 additional information with regard to the Company s investment in the 111 West 57 th Property and the legal proceedings related thereto, see Part I Item 1 Note 3 and Note 6 to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

While the Company s management is evaluating future courses of action to protect and/or recover the value of the Company s equity investment in the 111 West 57 th Property, the adverse developments make it uncertain as to whether any such courses of action will be successful. Any such efforts are likely to require sustained effort over a period of time and substantial
 additional financial resources. Inability to recover all or most of such value would in all likelihood have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and future prospects. The Company can give no assurances with regard to
 if it will prevail with respect to any of its claims.

As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2024, the Company commenced a private placement offering
 (the Equity Offering of up to 44,200,460 shares (the Shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Common Stock for 0.20 per share of Common Stock.

On April 1, 2024, the Company completed the issuance and sale of all Shares in the Equity Offering on the previously disclosed terms and conditions. The offer and sale of the Shares in the Equity Offering was
 completed in reliance on the exemption from registration under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D promulgated under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Total proceeds received from the Equity Offering were 8,840,000. For
 additional information, see Part I Item 1 Note 10 to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

The Company will continue to consider and explore other litigation funding agreements with third party litigation funders that it could enter into for portions of the litigation costs for up to 5 million of
 funding, at market terms to be agreed upon at such times. In general, litigation funding agreements are structured so that the litigation funder would receive back their initial funding amount first (i.e. before any recovery is received by the
 Company), plus an additional multiple ranging from 1.0 times to 3.5 times the amount funded (depending on various factors), plus depending on the funder, additional fees, expenses, interest and potentially an additional percentage of the total
 recovery received. There can be no assurance that the Company would be able to secure any such additional litigation funding on acceptable terms or at all.

In 2017, the Company entered into a Litigation Funding Agreement (the LFA with Mr. R.A. Bianco. Pursuant to the LFA, Mr. R.A. Bianco agreed to provide litigation funding to the Company, to satisfy actual
 documented litigation costs and expenses of the Company, including attorneys fees, expert witness fees, consulting fees and disbursements in connection with the Company s legal proceedings related to the Company s equity investment in the 111
 West 57th Property. In 2019, the Company and Mr. R.A. Bianco entered into an amendment to the LFA (the Amendment). For additional information including the terms of the Litigation Funding Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, see Part I Item 1 Note 7 to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash of 8,205,000 was used by operations as a result of the payment of operating expenses and prior year accruals.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash of 2,174,000 was used by operations as a result of the payment of operating expenses and prior year accruals.

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2024, decreased from December 31, 2023, principally relating to the payment of outstanding accrued expenses in April 2024, with funds received from the
 Equity Offering. For additional information, see Part I Item 1 Note 10 to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations for the Three Months and Nine months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. the Three Months and Nine months Ended September 30, 2023

The Company recorded a net loss of 1,533,000 or 0.02 per share and 5,307,000 or 0.08 per share in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to a
 net loss of 1,399,000 or 0.03 per share and 3,888,000 or 0.10 per share in the respective 2023 periods.

Compensation and benefits were 345,000 and 1,056,000 in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 323,000 and 1,055,000 in the respective 2023 periods. The increase
 in the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, versus the respective 2023 period, is due to an increase in compensation related expenses recorded in the 2024 three month period ended September 30, 2024.

Professional and outside services increased to 1,100,000 and 3,981,000 in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 858,000 and 2,399,000 in the respective 2023
 periods. The increase in the 2024 periods as compared to the 2023 periods is principally the result of a higher level of legal and professional fees incurred in 2024 in connection with the Company s legal proceedings relating to the Company s
 investment in the 111 West 57 th Property. For additional information with regard to the Company s investment in the 111 West 57 th Property and the legal proceedings related thereto, see Part I Item 1 Note 3 and Note 6 to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements.

Property operating and maintenance expenses were 8,000 and 18,000 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 7,000 and 17,000 in the
 respective 2023 periods. The slight increase in the 2024 three and nine month periods versus the respective 2023 periods is principally due to timing of payments in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the
 respective September 30, 2023, periods.

Insurance expenses were 59,000 and 103,000 in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 95,000 and 210,000 in the respective 2023 periods. The decrease is generally
 due to a decrease in certain policy coverages in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the respective 2023 periods.

Other operating expenses were 11,000 and 95,000 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 18,000 and 59,000 in the respective 2023 periods. The increase in the
 September 30, 2024, nine months ended compared to the September 30, 2023, nine months ended is due to a generally higher level of related expenses in the respective 2024 period.

Interest income in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 7,000 and 26,000, respectively, compared with 1,000 and 2,000 in the respective 2023 periods. The increased interest income
 in the September 30, 2024, three and nine month periods is due to a higher level of cash and cash equivalents in the 2024 periods versus the respective 2023 periods based on funds received from the Equity Offering in April 2024 and Company
 borrowings. For additional information, see Part I Item 1 Note 8, Note 9, and Note 10 to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Interest expense in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 17,000 and 80,000, respectively, compared with 99,000 and 150,000 in the
 respective 2023 periods. The interest expense for the 2024 three month period is attributable to interest expense relating to the loan(s) payable related party - BARC and loans payable related party R.A. Bianco. Interest expense for the 2024 nine month period
 is principally attributable to interest expense relating to the loan(s) payable related party R.A.
 Bianco , net of 51,000 of negative interest expense for the 2024 nine month period attributable to the reversal of interest expense owed to a professional firm for outstanding invoices that did not have to be paid due to the Company
 fully paying the outstanding amounts due in April 2024. Interest expense for the 2023 period is attributable to interest expense to a professional firm for outstanding and unpaid professional fees and interest
 expense relating to the loan(s) payable related party R.A. Bianco. For additional information see Part I Item 1 Note 8 and Note 9 to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Income taxes applicable to operating income (loss) are generally determined by applying the estimated effective annual income tax rates to pretax income (loss) for the year-to-date interim period. Income taxes
 applicable to unusual or infrequently occurring items are provided in the period in which such items occur. For additional information including a discussion of income tax matters, see Part I Item 1 Note 5
