. The Company has financed its operations mainly through fundraising from various investors. 
 
 The
 Company s management expects that the Company will continue to generate losses and negative cash flows from operations for
 the foreseeable future. Based on the projected cash flows and cash balances as of September 30, 2024, management is of the opinion
 that its existing cash will not be sufficient to fund operations for a period of more than 12 months. As a result, there is substantial
 doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Management s
 plans include the continued commercialization of the Company s products, reduction in its operating expenses and net losses and securing sufficient financing through the sale
 of additional equity securities, debt or capital inflows from strategic partnerships. Additional funds may not be available when
 the Company needs them, on terms that are acceptable to it, or at all. If the Company is unsuccessful in commercializing its products
 and securing sufficient financing, it may need to cease operations. 
 
 The
 financial statements include no adjustments for measurement or presentation of assets and liabilities, which may be required should
 the Company fail to operate as a going concern. 

c. 
 In
 October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on
 civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located
 along Israel s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in thousands
 of deaths and injuries, and Hamas additionally kidnapped many Israeli civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel s
 security cabinet declared war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign against Hamas and other terrorist organizations in
 parallel to their continued rocket and terror attacks. In addition, since the commencement of these events, there have been continued
 hostilities along Israel s northern border with Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror organization) and on other fronts from various extremist groups in region, such as the Houthi movement in Yemen and various rebel militia
groups in Syria and Iraq. Israel has carried out a number of targeted strikes on sites belonging to these terror organizations and in
October 2024, Israel began limited ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon.
 In addition, Iran recently launched direct attacks on Israel involving hundreds of drones and missiles and has threatened to continue
 to attack Israel and is widely believed to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among
 extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi movement in Yemen and various rebel militia
 groups in Syria and Iraq. Such clashes may escalate in the future into a greater regional conflict. 

The
 security situation in Israel has had an immaterial effect on its operations and financial results so far. This is attributable to
 its global footprint and the offices in Spain, which has become a hub for the Company s sizing solutions business. The
 majority of Orgad s inventory utilizes fulfillment by Amazon rather than fulfilling directly. Inventory is now maintained in
 and orders are shipped from regional Amazon warehouses, thereby reducing exposure to inventory risk and contributing to operating
 efficiencies. 
 
 On
 February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. The outbreak of hostilities between the two countries could result in more widespread
 conflict and could have a severe adverse effect on the region. Following Russia s actions, various countries, issued broad-ranging
 economic sanctions against Russia. Such sanctions included, among other things, a prohibition on doing business with certain Russian
 companies, officials and oligarchs; a commitment by certain countries and the European Union to remove selected Russian banks from
 the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) electronic banking network that connects banks globally;
 and restrictive measures to prevent the Russian Central Bank from undermining the impact of the sanctions. 
 
 The
 Company shut down its operation in Russia and is expected to close down its subsidiary, My Size LLC, but due to technical reasons it
 is expected to occur in the near future; therefore, the impact from the current situation is very limited.

was recorded as the carrying value of SaaS Solution reporting segment exceeded its expected fair value, as determined using a
 discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on management s future revenue and cost estimates. This impairment charge
 was recorded within Impairment of goodwill, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and within the SaaS Solution segment
 for three months ended September 30, 2024. See note 6- Goodwill. 

d. 
 Recent
 adopted accounting pronouncements: 

In
 June 2022, the FASB issued ASC 2022-03 Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions .
 The ASU clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account
 of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring its fair value. The ASU also clarifies that an entity cannot,
 as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The ASU also introduces new disclosure requirements
 for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The ASU do not have a material impact on the Company consolidated
 financial statements. 

In
 August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and
 Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible
 debt instruments and convertible preferred stock and amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an
 entity s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the
 related earnings per share guidance. This standard became effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024. Adoption is either
 a modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective method of transition. The Company adopted this guidance effective January
 1, 2024, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

e. 
 Recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted: 

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03 Income Statement Reporting
Comprehensive Income Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40). The ASU improves the disclosures about a public business
entity s expenses and provides more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. The
amendments require that at each interim and annual reporting period an entity will, inter alia, disclose amounts of purchases of inventory,
employee compensation, depreciation and amortization included in each relevant expense caption (such as cost of sales, SG A and research
and development). 

The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company s disclosures.

In
March 2017, the Company adopted the My Size, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2017 Employee Plan pursuant to which
the Company s Board of Directors may grant stock options and other equity awards to officers and key employees. The total number
of shares of common stock which may be granted to directors, officers, employees under this plan, is limited to shares. Stock
options can be granted with an exercise price equal to or less than the stock s fair market value at the date of grant. 

On
December 27, 2023, the Company s stockholders approved an increase in the shares available for issuance under the 2017 Equity Incentive
Plan from shares to shares.

Incentive Plan to Ronen Luzon, Or Kles and Billy Pardo, pursuant to which they were issued restricted shares, restricted

directors that will vest on January 1, 2025 and five-years options to purchase up to shares of common stock to other employees
of the Company at an exercise price of per share. The option vesting period is over three years in three equal portions from the
vesting commencement date. 

The
compensation cost resulting from the grant is approximately and is expected to be recognized over a period of years. 

The
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Binomial option-pricing model that used the weighted average
assumptions in the following table. The risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve

 damages in an amount of 
 arising from an alleged breach of the Agreement. On September 6, 2018 North Empire filed a Notice of Discontinuance of the action it
 had filed on August 2, 2018. On September 27, 2018, North Empire filed an answer and asserted counterclaims in the action commenced
 by the Company against them, alleging that the Company failed to deliver stock certificates to North Empire causing damage to North
 Empire in the amount of .
 North Empire also filed a third-party complaint against the Company s CEO and now former Chairman of the Board asserting
 similar claims against them in their individual capacities. On October 17, 2018, the Company filed a reply to North Empire s
 counterclaims. On November 15, 2018, the Company s CEO and now former Chairman of the Board filed a motion to dismiss North
 Empire s third-party complaint. On January 6, 2020, the Court granted the motion and dismissed the third-party complaint.
 Discovery has been completed and both parties have filed motions for summary judgment in connection with the claims and
 counterclaims. On December 30, 2021, the Court denied both the Company and North Empire s motions for summary judgment,
 arguing there were factual issues to be determined at trial. On January 26, 2022, the Company filed a notice of appeal of the
 summary judgment decision. On February 3, 2022, the Company filed a motion to reargue the Court s decision denying the
 Company s motion for summary judgment. North Empire will file its opposition papers on or before March 31, 2022, and the
 Company will file reply papers on April 29, 2022. On or about September 12, 2022, the Court issued its Decision and Order denying
 the Company s motion to reargue. North Empire filed its opposing brief on December 7, 2022. On March 13, 2023, the Supreme
 Court referred the case to its Alternative Dispute Program and ordered the cases to mediate. The mediation was held on July 26, 2023
 and various settlement options were explored but the mediation did not lead to settlement. On December 21, 2023, a conference with
 the Court was held and the parties were given dates for various pre-trial filings. In October, 2024, the parties agreed on
 settlement terms and are finalizing the settlement documents, including a global settlement with a third party with related claims.
 The Company recognized a loss of approximately 
 from the settlement agreement. After the parties sign the settlement agreement, the Company will file the stipulation to
 discontinue. 

b. 
 In
 July 2024, the Company was served with a legal complaint filed by Shimon Shukron in the Magistrate s Court in Herzliya for a
 monetary award in an amount of NIS 
 (approximately ).
 The plaintiff alleges that due to the fire that broke out at Orgad s warehouse in January 2023, the fire spread to the
 plaintiff s business and caused heavy damage to the structure and contents, inventory of the business and loss of profits. The
 Company filed its statement of defense in September 2024. At this preliminary stage, the plaintiff did not provide sufficient
 documents to support his claims regarding the extent of the alleged damage. The Company is working on its damage evaluation analysis. As such, the Company
cannot evaluate the chances of the claim to succeed.

In September 2024, the Company
updated the forecasted future cash flows used in the impairment assessment, including revenues, margin, and capital expenditures to
reflect current conditions. Other changes in valuation assumptions included selection of lower revenue growth rates based upon an
assessment of current market conditions. As a result of this review, the Company did not identify an impairment to its
definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets, but the Company recorded a 
non-deductible goodwill impairment charge for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (level 3 fair value measurement). 

This
impairment charge was recorded within Impairment of goodwill, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and within the SaaS based
innovative artificial intelligence driven measurement solutions segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

of operations and financial condition for the periods described. This discussion should be read together with our condensed consolidated
interim financial statements and the notes to the financial statements, which are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This
information should also be read in conjunction with the information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC on April 1, 2024, or the Annual Report, including the consolidated
annual financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and their accompanying notes included therein.

statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or
performance are not historical facts and are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made through the
use of words or phrases such as believe, will, expect, anticipate, estimate, 
 intend, plan and would. For example, statements concerning financial condition, possible or
assumed future results of operations, growth opportunities, industry ranking, plans and objectives of management, markets for our common

performance or achievements to differ materially from any results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied
by any forward-looking statement. 

Any
forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed throughout this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q. Some of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or
projections contained in the forward-looking statements include but are not limited to:

 terms, or at all; 

risks
 related to our ability to continue as a going concern; 

the
 new and unproven nature of the measurement technology markets; 

our
 ability to achieve customer adoption of our products; 

our
 ability to realize the benefits of our acquisitions of Orgad and Naiz; 

our
 dependence on assets we purchased from a related party;

statements. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference herein and have filed as exhibits
to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different

statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to
update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the
occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors will
arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors,
may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We qualify all of the information
presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and particularly our forward-looking statements, by these cautionary statements.

Recent
Developments 

Hamas-Israel
War 

In
October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian
and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel s
border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries,
and Hamas additionally kidnapped many Israeli civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel s security cabinet declared
war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign against Hamas and other terrorist organizations in parallel to their continued rocket
and terror attacks. In addition, since the commencement of these events, there have been continued hostilities along Israel s northern
border with Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror organization) and on other fronts from various extremist groups in region, such as the Houthi
movement in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria and Iraq. Israel has carried out a number of targeted strikes on sites belonging
to these terror organizations and in October 2024, Israel began limited ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon. In addition, Iran
recently launched direct attacks on Israel involving hundreds of drones and missiles and has threatened to continue to attack Israel
and is widely believed to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the
region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi movement in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria and Iraq.
 Such clashes may escalate in the future into a greater regional conflict. To date, security situation in Israel has had an immaterial effect
on our operations and financial results. This is attributable to our global footprint and the offices in Spain, which has become a hub
for our sizing solutions business and the majority of Orgad s inventory utilizes fulfillment by Amazon rather than fulfilling directly.

30, 2023. The decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding period is primarily attributable to a decrease
in Orgad sales due to low inventory and seasonality.

Of Revenues 

Our
cost of revenues expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 3,831,000 compared to 2,698,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase in comparison with the corresponding period was mainly due to an increase in revenues described
above offset by an inventory mark-down of 643,000 due to the fire that occurred in Orgad s warehouse during January 2023. 

Our

Our
research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 352,000 compared to 811,000 for the nine

general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 640,000 compared to 1,287,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in professional services and insurance expenses.

the nine months ended September 30, 2023 The decrease compared to the corresponding period was mainly due to a decrease in financial
expenses exchange rate differences. 

Our

three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease compared to the corresponding period was mainly due to a decrease in financial expenses
exchange rate differences.

a result of the foregoing, our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,280,000, compared to net loss of 5,077,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss was mainly due to the reasons mentioned above. 

As
a result of the foregoing, our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,300,000, compared to net loss of 1,132,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss was mainly due to the reasons mentioned above. 

19 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Since
our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through public and private offerings of debt and equity securities in the State
of Israel and in the United States 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 2,371,000 compared to 2,264,000 of cash, cash equivalents
and restricted cash as of December 31, 2023. This increase primarily resulted from the warrant repricing transaction that was completed
in May 2024, offset by payments that were made to suppliers, resources that were deployed to grow our businesses and payments related
to the Orgad acquisition. 

Cash
used in operating activities amounted to 2,523,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4,910,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in operating activity is derived mainly from a change in inventory, impairment
of goodwill and a decrease in the net loss offset by a change in account receivables, trade payables and liabilities to related parties. 

Net
cash provided by investing activities was 60,000 or the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to none for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 2,626,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6,230,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash flow from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted
from the May 2024 warrant repricing transaction and a loan that was received in February 2024 compared to the public and private
offerings that occurred in January and August 2023. 

We
expect that we will continue to generate losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. Based on the projected
cash flows and cash balances as of September 30, 2024, we believe our existing cash will not be sufficient to fund operations for a period
of more than 12 months. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will need to raise
additional capital, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Additional capital would be used to accomplish the following: 

finance
 our current operating expenses; 

pursue
 growth opportunities; 

hire
 and retain qualified management and key employees; 

respond
 to competitive pressures; 

comply
 with regulatory requirements; and 

maintain
 compliance with applicable laws. 

Current
conditions in the capital markets are such that traditional sources of capital may not be available to us when needed or may be available
only on unfavorable terms. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic
conditions, the security situation in Israel, and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control, and on our
financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully raise additional capital at all or on terms
that are acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. 

To
the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities
could result in substantial dilution for our current stockholders. The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital-raising
transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants
or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then-outstanding. We
may issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock in
connection with hiring or retaining personnel, option or warrant exercises, future acquisitions or future placements of our securities
for capital-raising or other business purposes. The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility
of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline and existing stockholders may not agree with our financing
plans or the terms of such financings. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment
banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may
also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants,
which may adversely impact our financial condition. Furthermore, any additional debt or equity financing that we may need may not be
available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing on a timely basis, we may have to
curtail our development activities and growth plans and/or be forced to sell assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms, or we may have to
cease our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We
have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities in which we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests,
derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other
obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk
support.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements,
which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the
reported expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Our
significant accounting policies were revenue from contracts with customers which are more fully described in the notes to our financial
statements included herein. We believe these accounting policies discussed below are critical to our financial results and to the understanding
of our past and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s estimates and
assumptions. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires us to make assumptions because information was not
available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making our estimate; and (2) changes in the
estimate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Goodwill
impairment assessment 

We determine
the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach. According to the income, we use discounted cash flows to estimate the
fair value. Cash flow projections require us to make significant estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into
consideration the industry s and market s conditions. The discount rate used is based on the weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics. 

Examples of critical estimates
in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to the discount
rate, the terminal growth rate and the revenue growth rate. 

We have experienced a pair of triggering events in the period ended September
30, 2024 due to sustained decreases in our share price and a decline in actual and forecasted operating results, prompting impairment
assessments of goodwill and long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangibles. 

The table below indicates changes in the most significant inputs to our
impairment analysis on each testing date since its last annual test.

In
September 2024, we updated the forecasted future cash flows used in the impairment assessment, including revenues, margin, and
capital expenditures to reflect current conditions. Other changes in valuation assumptions included selection of lower revenue
multiples based upon an assessment of current market conditions. As a result of this review, we did not identify an impairment to
its definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets. 

Based on our analysis, we determined that the carrying
value of our SaaS Solutions reporting unit exceeded its fair value and an impairment charge of 631,000 was recorded. The analysis was done for the Fashion and equipment e-commerce platform reporting unit as well, but the reporting
value exceeds its carrying amount.

impairment to its definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets or for its goodwill for the quarter ended September
30, 2024 (level 3 fair value measurement). 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. 

Not
required for a smaller reporting company. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under
the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing
and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon
such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of
September 30, 2024 were effective. 

Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls
will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. 

Changes
in Internal Controls 

During
the most recent fiscal quarter, no change has occurred in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part
II Other Information 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However,
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may
harm our business. 

North
Empire LLC 

On
August 7, 2018, we commenced an action against North Empire LLC, or North Empire, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York for breach of a Securities Purchase Agreement or Agreement in which we are seeking damages in an amount to be
determined at trial, but in no event less than 616,000. On August 2, 2018, North Empire filed a Summons with Notice against us,
also in the same Court, in which they allege damages in an amount of 11.4 million arising from an alleged breach of the Agreement.
On September 6, 2018, North Empire filed a Notice of Discontinuance of the action it had filed on August 2, 2018. On September 27,
2018, North Empire filed an answer and asserted counterclaims in the action commenced by us against them, alleging that we failed to
deliver stock certificates to North Empire causing damage to North Empire in the amount of 10,958,589. North Empire also filed a
third-party complaint against our CEO and now former Chairman of the Board asserting similar claims against them in their individual
capacities. On October 17, 2018, we filed a reply to North Empire s counterclaims. On November 15, 2018, our CEO and now
former Chairman of the Board filed a motion to dismiss North Empire s third-party complaint. On January 6, 2020, the Court
granted the motion and dismissed the third-party complaint. Discovery has been completed and both parties have filed motions for
summary judgment in connection with the claims and counterclaims. On December 30, 2021, the Court denied both My Size and North
Empire s motions for summary judgment, arguing there were factual issues to be determined at trial. On January 26, 2022, the
Company filed a notice of appeal of the summary judgment decision. On February 3, 2022, the Company filed a motion to reargue the
Court s decision denying the Company s motion for summary judgment. On or about September 12, 2022, the Court issued its
Decision and Order denying the Company s motion to reargue. North Empire filed its opposing brief on December 7, 2022. On or
about March 13, 2023, the Supreme Court referred the case to its Alternative Dispute Program and ordered the cases to mediate. The
mediation was held on July 26, 2023 and various settlement options were explored but the mediation did not lead to settlement. On
December 21, 2023, a conference with the Court was held and the parties were given dates for various pre-trial filings. In October,
2024, the parties agreed on settlement terms and are finalizing the settlement documents, including a global settlement with a third
party with related claims. The Company recognized a loss of approximately 40 from the settlement agreement. After the parties sign
the settlement agreement, the Company will file the stipulation to discontinue. 

Shimon
Shukron 

In
July 2024, we were served with a legal complaint filed by Shimon Shukron in the Magistrate s Court in Herzliya for a monetary award
in an amount of NIS 1,895,345 (approximately 510,000). The plaintiff alleges that due to the fire that broke out at Orgad s warehouse
in January 2023, the fire spread to the plaintiff s business and caused heavy damage to the structure and contents, inventory of
the business and loss of profits. We filed our statement of defense in September 2024. At this preliminary stage, The plaintiff did not provide sufficient
documents to support his claims regarding the extent of the alleged damage. The Company is working on its damage evaluation analysis. As such, we cannot
evaluate the chances of the claim to succeed. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

Except
as set forth below in this Item 1A and the Risk Factors included in our previous filings made with the SEC, there have been no
material changes to our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.

Our
headquarters and some of our operations are located in Israel, and therefore, political, economic and military conditions in Israel may
affect our operations and results. 

Our
headquarters and some of our operations are located in central Israel and our key employees, officers and directors are residents of
Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding region may directly affect our business
and operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and
its Arab neighbors. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade within Israel or between Israel and
its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of operations and could make it more difficult for us to raise
capital. 

In
particular, in October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of
attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers
located along Israel s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in thousands
of deaths and injuries, and Hamas additionally kidnapped many Israeli civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel s security
cabinet declared war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign against Hamas and these terrorist organizations in parallel continued
rocket and terror attacks. As a result of the events of October 7, 2023, the Israeli government declared that the country was at war
and the Israeli military began to call-up reservists for active duty. None of our full-time or part-time employees in Israel were called
up for reserve service. Military service call ups that result in absences of personnel from us for an extended period of time may materially
and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 

Since
the war broke out on October 7, 2023, our operations have not been adversely affected by this situation, and we have not experienced
disruptions to our business operations. In particular, most of our operations are in Spain. However, the intensity and duration of Israel s
current war against Hamas is difficult to predict at this stage, as are such war s economic implications on our business and operations
and on Israel s economy in general. If the war extends for a long period of time or expands to other fronts, such as Lebanon, Syria
and the West Bank, our operations may be adversely affected. 

In
addition, since the commencement of these events, there have been continued hostilities along Israel s northern border with Lebanon
(with the Hezbollah terror organization) and on other fronts from various extremist groups in region, such as the Houthi
movement in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria and Iraq. Israel has carried out a number of targeted strikes on sites belonging
to these terror organizations and in October 2024, Israel began limited ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon. In addition, Iran recently launched direct attacks on Israel involving hundreds of drones and missiles and has threatened to continue
to attack Israel and is widely believed to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist
groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi movement in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria.
These situations may potentially escalate in the future to more violent events which may affect Israel and us. Any armed conflicts, terrorist
activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions, could harm our results of operations and
could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. Parties with whom we do business may decline to travel to Israel during periods
of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary in order to meet our business partners face
to face. In addition, the political and security situation in Israel may result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance
in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions
in such agreements. Further, in the past, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to economic boycotts. Several
countries still restrict business with the State of Israel and with Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may have an
adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition or the expansion of our business. Any hostilities involving Israel or the
interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of operations.
In recent years, the hostilities involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, including areas in which
our employees and some of our consultants are located, and negatively affected business conditions in Israel. 

Our
commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle
East. Although the Israeli government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks
or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have
a material adverse effect on our business. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region would likely negatively affect
business conditions and could harm our results of operations. 

The
continued political instability and hostilities between Israel and its neighbors and any future armed conflict, terrorist activity or
political instability in the region could adversely affect our operations in Israel and adversely affect the market price of our shares
of common stock. In addition, several organizations and countries may restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli companies have
been and are today subjected to economic boycotts. The interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Finally,
political conditions within Israel may affect our operations. Israel has held five general elections between 2019 and 2022, and prior
to October 2023, the Israeli government pursued extensive changes to Israel s judicial system, which sparked extensive political
debate and unrest. To date, these initiatives have been substantially put on hold. Actual or perceived political instability in Israel
or any negative changes in the political environment, may individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Israeli economy and,
in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
