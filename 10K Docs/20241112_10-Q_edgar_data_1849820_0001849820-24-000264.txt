 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Overview 
 Nauticus Robotics, Inc. (the Company, our, us or we is a developer of ocean robots, cloud software and services delivered to the ocean industry. The Company s principal corporate offices are located in Webster, Texas. Our services provide customers with the necessary data collection, analytics, and subsea manipulation capabilities to support and maintain assets while reducing their operational footprint, operating cost, and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as to improve offshore health, safety, and environmental exposure. 
 Our subsea robotic product, Aquanaut, is a vehicle that begins its mission in a hydrodynamically efficient configuration that enables efficient transit to the worksite (i.e. operating as an autonomous underwater vehicle, or AUV ). During transit (operating in survey mode), Aquanaut s sensor suite provides the capability to observe and inspect subsea assets or other subsea features. Once it arrives at the worksite, Aquanaut transforms its hull configuration to expose two electric manipulators that can perform dexterous tasks with (supervised), or without (autonomous), direct human involvement. In this intervention mode, the vehicle has capabilities similar to a conventional remotely operated vehicle ROV ). The ability to operate in both AUV and ROV modes is a quality unique to our subsea robot and is protected under a U.S. patent. To take advantage of these special configuration qualities, we have developed underwater acoustic communication technology, called Wavelink, our over-the-horizon remote connectivity solution, which removes the need for long umbilical cables to connect the robot with topside vessels. Eliminating these umbilical cables and communicating with the robot through acoustic or other latent, laser, or RF methods reduces much of the system infrastructure currently required for ROV servicing operations and is core to our value proposition. 
 The component technologies that comprise the Aquanaut are also marketable to the existing worldwide ROV fleet. Aquanaut s perception and machine learning software technologies combined with its perception and electric manipulators can be retrofitted on existing ROV platforms to improve their ability to perform subsea maintenance activities. 
 Our key technologies are autonomous platforms, acoustic communications networks, electric manipulators, AI-based perception and control software, and high-definition workspace sensors. Implementation of these technologies enables operators to reduce costs relative to conventional methods.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Not required for smaller reporting companies. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation and under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Interim Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, as a result of the continuation of the previously disclosed material weakness discussed below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. In light of this fact, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, have performed additional analyses, reconciliations, and other post-closing procedures in order to conclude that, notwithstanding such material weakness, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP as of the dates and for the periods presented in this Form 10-Q. 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, as amended. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Previously identified material weakness. In 2021, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the standards established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This material weakness related to a lack of qualified accounting and financial reporting personnel with an appropriate level of experience and inadequate procedures for the accounting close process including obtaining information supporting significant accounting estimates and judgments affecting the financial statements on a timely basis. As a result, our management concluded that a material weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Through the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we continued to implement remediation initiatives in response to the previously identified material weakness, including, but not limited to, hiring additional experienced accounting and financial reporting personnel and modifying a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System which will assist in the automation of processes, including standardizing workflows, enhancing segregation of duties, and ensuring compliance with policies. As a result of the significant turnover of key finance personnel at the end of 2023 and limited handover to the new finance team, we have concluded there was a gap in the implementation of the above remediation initiatives.

Table of Contents 

 Remediation Plan. In order to remediate the material weakness, the Company plans to formally document the system controls that we have in place, including user access reviews and a formally documented segregation of duties that includes formal system-based roles. Our ongoing remediation actions planned include: 
 Continue to search for, evaluate and hire qualified accounting personnel to prepare and report financial information in accordance with GAAP; 
 Identify gaps in our skills base and the expertise of our staff required to meet the financial reporting requirements of a public company; and 
 Continue to develop policies and procedures on internal control over financial reporting and monitor the effectiveness of operations on existing controls and procedures 
 Our remediation activities are ongoing and are subject to continued management review supported by ongoing design and testing of our framework of internal controls over financial reporting. Due to the nature of the remediation process and the need for sufficient time after implementation to evaluate and test the design and effectiveness of the controls, no assurance can be given as to the timing for completion of remediation 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, except as described above in "Remediation Plan" there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent limitation on the effectiveness of internal control. The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.
