Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1. Consolidated Financial
 Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

This section discusses our results of operations for the current quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the immediately preceding prior quarter ended June 30, 2024.

General

We are a public residential real estate finance company focused on acquiring, investing in and managing residential mortgage assets in the United States. We were incorporated in Maryland on October
 31, 2012, and we commenced operations on or about October 9, 2013 following the completion of our initial public offering and a concurrent private placement. Our common stock, our 8.20 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (our Series
 A Preferred Stock and our 8.250 Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (our Series B Preferred Stock are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols CHMI , CHMI-PRA and CHMI-PRB ,
 respectively. We are externally managed by our Manager, Cherry Hill Mortgage Management, LLC, an SEC-registered investment adviser.

Our principal objective is to generate attractive current yields and risk-adjusted total returns for our stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividend distributions and secondarily
 through capital appreciation. We attempt to attain this objective by selectively constructing and actively managing a portfolio of Servicing Related Assets (as defined below) and residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS and, subject to
 market conditions, other cash flowing residential mortgage assets.

We are subject to the risks involved with real estate and real estate-related debt instruments. These include, among others, the risks normally associated with changes in the general economic climate,
 changes in the mortgage market, changes in tax laws, interest rate levels, and the availability of financing.

We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We operate so as to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT. Our
 asset acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring a diversified portfolio of residential mortgage assets that balances the risk and reward opportunities our Manager observes in the marketplace. Aurora has or is in the process of obtaining the
 licenses necessary to invest in mortgage servicing rights MSRs on a nationwide basis and is an approved seller/servicer for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

In addition to Servicing Related Assets, we invest in RMBS, primarily those backed by 30-, 20- and 15-year fixed rate mortgages that offer what we believe to be favorable prepayment and duration
 characteristics. Our RMBS consist solely of Agency RMBS on which the payments of principal and interest are guaranteed by an Agency. In the past, we have invested in collateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed by an Agency Agency CMOs consisting of interest only securities IOs as well as non-Agency RMBS and may do so in the future subject to market conditions and availability of capital. We finance our RMBS with an amount of leverage, that varies from time to time
 depending on the particular characteristics of our portfolio, the availability of financing and market conditions. We do not have a targeted leverage ratio for our RMBS. Our borrowings for RMBS consist of short-term borrowings under master
 repurchase agreements.

Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we utilize derivative financial instruments (or hedging instruments) to hedge our exposure to potential interest rate mismatches between the
 interest we earn on our assets and our borrowing costs caused by fluctuations in short-term interest rates. In utilizing leverage and interest rate hedges, our objectives include, where desirable, locking in, on a long-term basis, a spread
 between the yield on our assets and the cost of our financing in an effort to improve returns to our stockholders.

We also seek to operate our business in a manner that does not require us to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

We conduct substantially all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets through our Operating Partnership. We are the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership. As of September
 30, 2024, we owned 98.0 of our Operating Partnership. Our Operating Partnership, in turn, owns all of the outstanding common stock of CHMI Sub-REIT, Inc. (the Sub-REIT ). The Sub-REIT has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing
 with its taxable year ended December 31, 2020.

From time to time, we may issue and sell shares of our common stock or preferred stock, including additional shares of our Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock. See Item 1.
 Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6. Equity and Earnings per Common Share Common and Preferred Stock .

In September 2019, the Company initiated a share repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 10.0 million of its common stock. As of September 30, 2024, approximately
 4.7 million was remaining under the share repurchase program. Shares of common stock may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rules

 repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares of common stock, and, subject to SEC rules, purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. During the three and nine-month periods ended

In December 2023, the Company initiated a preferred stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 50.0 million of its shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series
 B Preferred Stock. Shares of preferred stock may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. The
 manner, price, number and timing of share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. The preferred stock repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares
 of preferred stock, and, subject to SEC rules, purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its preferred stock
 pursuant to the repurchase program. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 395,897 shares of its Series B Preferred Stock at a weighted average purchase price of 23.77 per share and paid aggregate
 brokerage commissions of approximately 11,900 on such repurchases. The difference between the consideration transferred and the carrying value of the preferred stock repurchased resulted in a gain attributable to common stockholders of 78,000
 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its preferred stock pursuant to the repurchase program. Shares of preferred stock that are repurchased by
 the Company cease to be outstanding but remain authorized for future issuance.

Effects of Federal Reserve Policy on the Company

Since September 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve has lowered its federal funds rate target by 0.75 to between 4.50 to 4.75 . Over the past year, the Federal Reserve had kept constant its federal funds
 rate target after sharply increasing the target and otherwise tightening monetary policy in 2022 and 2023 to combat an increase in U.S. inflation. Inflation peaked in June of 2022 with consumer prices rising at a rate of 9.1 on a year-over-year
 basis, but has subsequently declined to 2.4 on a year-over-year basis in September of 2024. Based on this decline in inflation and other data, the Federal Reserve has stated that an easing of monetary policy is appropriate and that future rate
 cuts are likely. The Federal Reserve has also reduced the speed of the runoff of its balance sheet. On June 1, 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered its a monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities to 25 billion from 60 billion and maintained
 its 35 billion redemption cap on agency debt/MBS. The Federal Reserve reinvests principle payments in excess of these caps into Treasury securities in a manner that approximates the maturity composition of outstanding Treasury securities
 outstanding.

The Federal Reserve s actions to ease monetary policy by reducing its federal funds rate and reduce the speed at which it is decreasing its balance sheet will generally lower interest rates across
 asset classes, including for Agency RMBS. Lower rates could reduce our funding costs and spur economic activity, increasing our net interest income. Higher prepayment could reduce the length of cash flows from the MSRs and accelerate the premium
 amortization on the RMBS portfolio. In the event that the Federal Reserve reverses course and tightens monetary policy in the future by increasing the federal funds rate and/or the rate of its run off of its balance sheet, these actions could
 result in higher interest rates, including for Agency RMBS, and reduce economic activity in the United States, as well as decrease spreads on interest rates, which can reduce our net interest income and increase our funding costs. They may also
 negatively impact our results as we have certain assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. In addition, lower net interest income resulting from higher rates is partially offset by lower prepayments which extends the
 length of cash flows from the MSRs and slows the premium amortization on the RMBS portfolio.

The impact on our operating results of future actions by the Federal Reserve that change market interest rates is discussed further below. See Factors Impacting our Operating Results .

Factors Impacting our Operating Results

Our income is generated primarily by the net spread between the income we earn on our assets and the cost of our financing and hedging activities as well as the amortization of any purchase premiums
 or the accretion of discounts. Our net income includes the actual interest payments we receive on our RMBS, the net servicing fees we receive on our MSRs and the accretion/amortization of any purchase discounts/premiums. Changes in various
 factors such as market interest rates, prepayment speeds, estimated future cash flows, servicing costs and credit quality could affect the amount of premium to be amortized or discount to be accreted into interest income for a given period.
 Prepayment speeds vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results may also be affected by credit losses in
 excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers whose mortgage loans underlie the MSRs held by Aurora.

Set forth below is the positive net spread between the yield on RMBS and our costs of funding those assets at the end of each of the quarters indicated below:

Changes in the Market Value of Our Assets

We hold our Servicing Related Assets as long-term investments. Our MSRs are carried at their fair value with changes in their fair value recorded in other income (loss) in our consolidated statements
 of income (loss). Those values may be affected by events or headlines that are outside of our control, such as events impacting the U.S. or global economy generally or the U.S. residential market specifically, and events or headlines impacting
 the parties with which we do business. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

All of our investments in RMBS are reported at their fair value . At the time of purchase, ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities requires us to designate a security as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, depending on our ability to hold such security to maturity. Alternatively, we
 may elect the fair value option of accounting for securities pursuant to ASC 825, Financial Instruments. Prior to January 1, 2023, we designated all our investments in RMBS as available-for-sale. On
 January 1, 2023, we elected the fair value option of accounting for all RMBS acquired after such date. Unrealized gains and losses on RMBS classified as available-for-sale are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, whereas unrealized
 gains and losses on RMBS for which we elected the fair value option are reported in the consolidated statements of income (loss).

We evaluate the cost basis of our available-for-sale RMBS on a quarterly basis under ASC 326-30, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Available-for-Sale Debt
 Securities. When the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost basis as of the balance sheet date, the security s cost basis is considered impaired. If we determine that we intend to sell the security or it is more likely
 than not that we will be required to sell before recovery, we recognize the difference between the fair value and amortized cost as a loss in the consolidated statements of income (loss). If we determine we do not intend to sell the security or
 it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery, we must evaluate the decline in the fair value of the impaired security and determine whether such decline resulted from a credit loss or non-credit related
 factors. In our assessment of whether a credit loss exists, we perform a qualitative assessment around whether a credit loss exists and if necessary, we compare the present value of estimated future cash flows of the impaired security with the
 amortized cost basis of such security. The estimated future cash flows reflect those that a market participant would use and typically include assumptions related to fluctuations in interest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates, collateral
 performance, and the timing and amount of projected credit losses, as well as incorporating observations of current market developments and events. Cash flows are discounted at an interest rate equal to the current yield used to accrete interest
 income. If the present value of estimated future cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, an expected credit loss exists and is included in provision for (reversal of) credit losses on securities in the consolidated
 statements of income (loss). If it is determined as of the financial reporting date that all or a portion of a security s cost basis is not collectible, then we will recognize a realized loss to the extent of the adjustment to the security s cost
 basis. This adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security is reflected in realized gain (loss) on RMBS, net in the consolidated statements of income (loss).

Impact of Changes in Market Interest Rates on Our Assets

The value of our assets may be affected by prepayment speeds on mortgage loans. Prepayment speed is the measurement of how quickly borrowers pay down the unpaid principal balance UPB of their
 loans or how quickly loans are otherwise liquidated or charged off. Generally, in a declining interest rate environment, prepayment speeds tend to increase. Conversely, in an increasing interest rate environment, prepayment speeds tend to
 decrease. When we acquire Servicing Related Assets or RMBS, we anticipate that the underlying mortgage loans will prepay at a projected rate generating an expected cash flow (in the case of Servicing Related Assets) and yield. If we purchase
 assets at a premium to par value and borrowers prepay their mortgage loans faster than expected, the corresponding prepayments on our assets may reduce the expected yield on such assets because we will have to amortize the related premium on an
 accelerated basis. In addition, we will have to reinvest the greater amounts of prepayments in that lower rate environment, thereby affecting future yields on our assets. If we purchase assets at a discount to par value, and borrowers prepay
 their mortgage loans slower than expected, the decrease in corresponding prepayments may reduce the expected yield on assets because we will not be able to accrete the related discount as quickly as originally anticipated.

51 

Table of Contents 

If prepayment speeds are significantly greater than expected, the fair value of the Servicing Related Assets could be less than their fair value as previously reported on our consolidated balance
 sheets. Such a reduction in the fair value of the Servicing Related Assets would have a negative impact on our book value. Furthermore, a significant increase in prepayment speeds could materially reduce the ultimate cash flows we receive from
 the Servicing Related Assets, and we could receive substantially less than what we paid for such assets. Our balance sheet, results of operations and cash flows are susceptible to significant volatility due to changes in the fair value of, or
 cash flows from, the Servicing Related Assets as interest rates change.

A slower than anticipated rate of prepayment due to an increase in market interest rates also will cause the life of the related RMBS to extend beyond that which was projected. As a result, we would
 have an asset with a lower yield than current investments for a longer period of time. In addition, if we have hedged our interest rate risk, extension may cause the security to be outstanding longer than the related hedge, thereby reducing the
 protection intended to be provided by the hedge.

Voluntary and involuntary prepayment rates may be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the availability of mortgage credit, the relative economic vitality of, or natural
 disasters affecting, the area in which the related properties are located, the servicing of the mortgage loans, possible changes in tax laws, other opportunities for investment, homeowner mobility and other economic, social, geographic,
 demographic and legal factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.

We attempt to reduce the exposure of our MSRs to voluntary prepayments through the structuring of recapture agreements with Aurora s subservicers. Under these agreements, the subservicer attempts to
 refinance specified mortgage loans. The subservicer sells the new mortgage loan to the applicable Agency, transfers the related MSR to Aurora and then subservices the new mortgage loan on behalf of Aurora. See Part I, Item 1. Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7. Transactions with Related Parties for information regarding Aurora s recapture agreements.

With respect to our business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause:

the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase;

the value of our assets to fluctuate;

the coupons on any adjustable-rate and hybrid RMBS we may own to reset, although on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates;

prepayments on our RMBS to slow, thereby slowing the amortization of our purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts; and

an increase in the value of any interest rate swap agreements we may enter into as part of our hedging strategy.

Conversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause:

prepayments on our RMBS to increase, thereby accelerating the amortization of our purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts;

the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease;

the value of our assets to fluctuate;

a decrease in the value of any interest rate swap agreements we may enter into as part of our hedging strategy; and

coupons on any adjustable-rate and hybrid RMBS assets we may own to reset, although on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates.

Regardless, we cannot predict the impact future actions by the Federal Reserve will have on our business, and any such actions may negatively impact us.

Effects of Spreads on our Assets

The spread between the yield on our assets and our funding costs affects the performance of our business. Wider spreads imply the potential for greater income on new asset purchases but may have a
 negative impact on our stated book value. Wider spreads may also negatively impact asset prices. In an environment where spreads are widening, counterparties may require additional collateral to secure borrowings which may require us to reduce
 leverage by selling assets. Conversely, tighter spreads imply the potential for lower income on new asset purchases but may have a positive impact on stated book value of our existing assets. In this case, we may be able to reduce the amount of
 collateral required to secure borrowings.

Credit Risk

We are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our assets. Although we expect relatively low credit risk with respect to our portfolios of Agency RMBS, we may become subject to
 the credit risk of borrowers under the loans backing any CMOs that we may own and to the credit enhancements built into the CMO structure. We also are subject to the credit risk of the borrowers under the mortgage loans underlying the MSRs that
 Aurora owns. Through loan level due diligence, we attempt to mitigate this risk by seeking to acquire high quality assets at appropriate prices given anticipated and unanticipated losses. We also conduct ongoing monitoring of acquired MSRs.
 Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur which could adversely impact our operating results.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP, which requires the use of estimates that involve the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties. Our
 most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments that could affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as our reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We believe that the decisions and assessments upon
 which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made and based upon information available to us at that time. Our critical accounting policies and accounting estimates may change over time as we diversify our portfolio. The
 material accounting policies and estimates that we expect to be most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below. For additional information on our
 material accounting policies and estimates, see Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies .

Investments in MSRs

We have elected the fair value option to record our investments in MSRs in order to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with better information regarding the effects of prepayment
 risk and other market factors on the MSRs. Under this election, we record a valuation adjustment on our investments in MSRs on a quarterly basis to recognize the changes in fair value of our MSRs in net income as described below. Although
 transactions in MSRs are observable in the marketplace, the valuation includes unobservable market data inputs (prepayment speeds, delinquency levels, costs to service and discount rates). The change in fair value of MSRs is recorded within
 Unrealized gain (loss) on investments in Servicing Related Assets on the consolidated statements of income (loss). Fair value is generally determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using discount rates that incorporate the market
 risks and liquidity premium specific to the MSRs and, therefore, may differ from their effective yields. In determining the valuation of MSRs, management uses internally developed pricing models that are based on certain unobservable market-based
 inputs. The Company classifies these valuations as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. For additional information on our fair value methodology, see Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Note 9. Fair Value .

Revenue Recognition on Investments in MSRs

Mortgage servicing fee income represents revenue earned from the ownership of MSRs. The servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are recognized as
 revenue as the related mortgage payments are collected. Corresponding costs to service are charged to expense as incurred. Servicing fee income received and servicing expenses incurred are reported on the consolidated statements of income (loss).

Income Taxes

We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We expect to continue to qualify to be treated as a REIT. U.S. federal income tax law
 generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate income tax rates to the
 extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of its taxable income. Our taxable REIT subsidiary, Solutions, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Aurora, are subject to U.S. federal income taxes on their taxable income.

We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes . ASC 740 requires the recording of deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effect
 of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, including operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
 measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is
 recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. For information on our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets, see Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Note 15. Income Taxes . We assess our tax
 positions for all open tax years and determine if we have any material unrecognized liabilities in accordance with ASC 740. We record these liabilities to the extent we deem them more-likely-than-not to be incurred. We record interest and
 penalties related to income taxes within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income (loss). We have not incurred any interest or penalties.

Investments in Securities

Prior to fiscal year 2023, we designated all our investments in RMBS as available-for-sale pursuant to ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities .
 Although we may hold most of our securities until maturity, we may, from time to time, sell any of our securities as part of our overall management of our asset portfolio. All assets classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value,
 with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. On January 1, 2023, we elected the fair value option of accounting pursuant to ASC 825, Financial

Instruments , for all RMBS acquired after such date. Unrealized gains and losses on RMBS for which we elected the fair value option are reported in the consolidated statements of income (loss). Fair value of our investments in RMBS is
 determined based upon prices obtained from third-party pricing providers. Changes in underlying assumptions used in estimating fair value impact the carrying value of the investments in RMBS as well as their yield. For additional information on
 our assessment of credit-related impairment and our fair value methodology, see Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Investments in RMBS and Note 9. Fair Value .

Revenue Recognition on Securities

Interest income from coupon payments is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the RMBS and their contractual terms. Premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of the RMBS are
 amortized or accreted into interest income over the projected lives of the securities using the effective interest method. Our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance,
 consensus prepayment speeds, and current market conditions. Adjustments are made for actual prepayment activity. For information on how interest rates affect net interest income, see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
 Risk Interest Rate Effect on Net Interest Income .

54 

Table of Contents 

Repurchase Transactions 

We finance the acquisition of our RMBS for our portfolio through repurchase transactions under master repurchase agreements. Repurchase transactions are treated as collateralized financing
 transactions and are carried at their contractual amounts as specified in the respective transactions. Accrued interest payable is included in Accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities financed
 through repurchase transactions remain on our consolidated balance sheet as an asset and cash received from the purchaser is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability. Interest paid in accordance with repurchase transactions is
 recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statements of income (loss).

Our GAAP equity changes as the values of our RMBS are marked to market each quarter, among other factors. The primary causes of mark to market changes are changes in interest rates and nominal
 spreads. During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, a drop in interest rates caused a net unrealized gain on our available-for-sale RMBS. Unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale RMBS is recorded in accumulated other
 comprehensive income (loss).

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section contains analysis and discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including:

earnings available for distribution; and

earnings available for distribution per average common share.

Earnings available for distribution EAD is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as GAAP net income (loss), excluding realized gain (loss) on RMBS, unrealized gain (loss) on RMBS measured at
 fair value through earnings, realized and unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives, realized gain (loss) on acquired assets, realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments in MSRs (net of any estimated MSR amortization) and any tax expense
 (benefit) on realized and unrealized gain (loss) on MSRs. MSR amortization refers to the portion of the change in fair value of the MSR that is primarily due to the realization of cashflows, runoff resulting from prepayments and an adjustment for
 any gain or loss on the capital used to purchase the MSR. EAD also includes interest rate swap periodic interest income (expense) and drop income on TBA dollar roll transactions, which are included in Realized gain (loss) on derivatives, net on
 the consolidated statements of income (loss). EAD is adjusted to exclude outstanding LTIP-OP Units in our Operating Partnership and dividends paid on our preferred stock.

Table of Contents 

EAD is provided for purposes of potential comparability to other issuers that invest in residential mortgage-related assets. We believe providing investors with EAD, in addition to related GAAP
 financial measures, may provide investors some insight into our ongoing operational performance. However, the concept of EAD does have significant limitations, including the exclusion of realized and unrealized gains (losses), and given the
 apparent lack of a consistent methodology among issuers for defining EAD, it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other issuers, which define EAD differently from us and each other. As a result, EAD should not be considered a
 substitute for our GAAP net income (loss) or as a measure of our liquidity. While EAD is one indicia of the Company s earnings capacity, it is not the only factor considered in setting a dividend and is
 not the same as REIT taxable income which is calculated in accordance with the rules of the IRS.

Earnings Available for Distribution

EAD for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three month period ended June 30, 2024 increased by approximately 248,000, or 0.00 per average common share.

EAD for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 decreased by approximately 5.1 million, or 0.25 per average common share due to
 changes in interest rates and an increase in expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain investments and other general business needs.
 Additionally, to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code, we must distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income. In 2017, the Internal Revenue Service issued a revenue procedure permitting publicly offered REITs to make
 elective stock dividends (i.e., dividends paid in a mixture of stock and cash), with at least 20 of the total distribution being paid in cash, to satisfy their REIT distribution requirements. In December 2021, the Internal Revenue Service issued
 a revenue procedure that temporarily reduces the minimum amount of the total distribution that must be paid in cash to 10 for distributions declared on or after November 1, 2021, and on or before June 30, 2022, provided certain other parameters
 detailed in the Revenue Procedure are satisfied. Pursuant to these revenue procedures, the Company has in the past elected to make distributions of its taxable income in a mixture of stock and cash.

Our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of cash provided by operating activities (primarily income from our investments in RMBS and net servicing income from our MSRs), sales or repayments
 of RMBS and borrowings under repurchase agreements and our MSR financing arrangements.

In the future, sources of funds for liquidity may include additional MSR financing, warehouse agreements, securitizations and the issuance of equity or debt securities, when feasible, including,
 without limitation, the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to our Common Stock ATM program or any other ATM program we have in place. For more information regarding issuances of our securities pursuant to our ATM programs, including
 our Common Stock ATM Program, please refer to General above. In the past we have used, and we anticipate that in the future we will use a significant portion of the paydowns of the RMBS to purchase MSRs. We may also sell certain RMBS and
 deploy the net proceeds from such sales to the extent necessary to fund the purchase price of MSRs.

Our primary uses of funds are the payment of interest, management fees, outstanding commitments, other operating expenses, investments in new or replacement assets, margin calls and the repayment of
 borrowings, as well as dividends. Although we continue to maintain a higher level of unrestricted cash than prior to the pandemic, we expect to invest more of that unrestricted cash in our targeted assets if normalization of the economy
 continues. We may also use capital resources to repurchase additional shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program when we believe such repurchases are appropriate and/or the stock is trading at a significant discount to net asset
 value. We seek to maintain adequate cash reserves and other sources of available liquidity to meet any margin calls resulting from decreases in value related to a reasonably possible (in the opinion of management) change in interest rates.

As of the date of this filing, we believe we have sufficient liquid assets to satisfy all of our short-term recourse liabilities and to satisfy covenants in our financing documents. With respect to
 the next twelve months, we expect that our cash on hand combined with the cash flow provided by our operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated liquidity needs with respect to our current investment portfolio, including related
 financings, potential margin calls and operating expenses. While it is inherently more difficult to forecast beyond the next twelve months, we currently expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through our cash on hand and, if needed,
 additional borrowings, proceeds received from repurchase agreements and similar financings, proceeds from equity offerings and the liquidation or refinancing of our assets.

Our operating cash flow differs from our net income due primarily to: (i) accretion of discount or premium on our RMBS, (ii) unrealized gains or losses on our RMBS and Servicing Related Assets, and
 (iii) impairment on our securities, if any.

Repurchase Agreements

As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchase agreements with 35 counterparties and approximately 1,108.5 million of outstanding repurchase agreement borrowings from 13 of those counterparties, which
 were used to finance RMBS. As of September 30, 2024, our exposure (defined as the amount of cash and securities pledged as collateral, less the borrowing under the repurchase agreement) to any of the counterparties under the repurchase agreements
 did not exceed five percent of the Company s equity. Under these agreements, which are uncommitted facilities, we sell a security to a counterparty and concurrently agree to repurchase the same security at a later date at the same price that we
 initially sold the security plus the interest charged. The sale price represents financing proceeds and the difference between the sale and repurchase prices represents interest on the financing. The price at which the security is sold generally
 represents the market value of the security less a discount or haircut . The weighted average haircut on our repurchase debt at September 30, 2024 was approximately 4.4 . During the term of the repurchase transaction, which can be as short as a
 few days, the counterparty holds the security and posts margin as collateral. The counterparty monitors and calculates what it estimates to be the value of the collateral during the term of the transaction. If this value declines by more than a
 de minimis threshold, the counterparty requires us to post additional collateral (or margin in order to maintain the initial haircut on the collateral. This margin is typically required to be posted in the form of cash and cash equivalents.
 Furthermore, we are, from time to time, a party to derivative agreements or financing arrangements that may be subject to margin calls based on the value of such instruments.

Set forth below is the average aggregate balance of borrowings under the Company s repurchase agreements for each of the periods shown and the aggregate balance as of the end of each such period

The increase in the Company s borrowings under its repurchase agreements as of September 30, 2024 as compared to June 30, 2024 was primarily due to the purchase of new RMBS securities, a large portion
 of which are financed through repurchase agreements.

These short-term borrowings were used to finance certain of our investments in RMBS. The RMBS repurchase agreements are guaranteed by the Company. The weighted average difference between the market
 value of the assets and the face amount of available financing for the RMBS repurchase agreements, or the haircut, was 4.4 as of September 30, 2024 and 4.3 December 31, 2023. The following tables provide additional information regarding
 borrowings under our repurchase agreements (dollars in thousands):

MSR Financing

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had two separate MSR financing facilities: (i) the Freddie Mac MSR Revolver, which is a revolving credit facility for up to 100.0 million that is secured by all
 Freddie Mac MSRs owned by Aurora; and (ii) the Fannie Mae MSR Revolving Facility, which is a revolving credit facility for up to 150.0 million, that is secured by all Fannie Mae MSRs owned by Aurora. Both financing facilities are available for
 MSRs as well as certain servicing related advances associated with MSRs.

Freddie Mac MSR Revolver . In July 2018, the Company, Aurora and QRS V (collectively with Aurora and the Company, the Borrowers entered into a 25.0 million
 revolving credit facility (the Freddie Mac MSR Revolver pursuant to which Aurora pledged all of its existing and future MSRs on loans owned or securitized by Freddie Mac. On April 2, 2019, Aurora and QRS V entered into an amendment that
 increased the maximum amount of the Freddie Mac MSR Revolver to 100.0 million. In July 2024, the Borrowers entered into an amendment that extended the revolving period for an additional 364 days with the Borrowers option for two renewals for
 similar terms followed by a one-year term out feature with a 24-month amortization schedule. Amounts borrowed bear interest at a weighted average borrowing rate of 8.2 . At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 57.7 million and
 64.5 million, respectively, was outstanding under the Freddie Mac MSR Revolver.

Fannie Mae MSR Revolving Facility . In October 2021, Aurora and QRS III entered into a loan and security agreement (the Fannie Mae MSR Revolving Facility ),
 pursuant to which Aurora and QRS III pledged their respective rights in all existing and future MSRs for loans owned or securitized by Fannie Mae to secure borrowings outstanding from time to time. The maximum credit amount outstanding at any one
 time under the Fannie Mae MSR Revolving Facility is 150.0 million. The revolving period is 24 months which may be extended by agreement with the lender. In October 2023, Aurora and QRS III entered into an amendment to the Fannie Mae MSR
 Revolving Facility that extended the revolving period for an additional 24 months. Amounts borrowed bear interest at a weighted average borrowing rate of 8.1 . At the end of the revolving period, the outstanding amount will be converted to a
 three-year term loan that will bear interest at a rate calculated at a spread over the rate for one-year interest rate swaps. The Company has guaranteed repayment of all indebtedness under the Fannie Mae MSR Revolving Facility. At September 30,
 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 94.1 million and 106.0 million, respectively, was outstanding under the Fannie Mae MSR Revolving Facility.

Cash Flows

Operating and Investing Activities

Our operating activities provided cash of approximately 4.4 million and used cash of approximately 10.6 million and our investing activities used cash of approximately 96.9 million and 167.7
 million during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024. The cash used by our investing activities resulted substantially from RMBS purchases offset by principal paydowns of RMBS and sales of RMBS and MSRs.

Dividends

U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital
 gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of its taxable income. We intend to make regular quarterly distributions of all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income to
 holders of our common and preferred stock out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must
 first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our repurchase agreements and other debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our REIT taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to
 make cash distributions, or, with respect to our common stock, we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. We will make distributions only upon the
 authorization of our board of directors. The amount, timing and frequency of distributions will be authorized by our board of directors based upon a variety of factors, including:

actual results of operations;

our level of retained cash flows;

our ability to make additional investments in our target assets;

restrictions under Maryland law;

the terms of our preferred stock;

any debt service requirements;

our taxable income;

the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code; and

other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.

Our ability to make distributions to our stockholders will depend upon the performance of our investment portfolio, and, in turn, upon our Manager s management of our business. Distributions will be
 made quarterly in cash to the extent that cash is available for distribution. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash available for distribution to pay distributions to our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may change our
 distribution policy with respect to our common stock in the future. No assurance can be given that we will be able to make any other distributions to our stockholders at any time in the future or that the level of any distributions we do make to
 our stockholders will achieve a market yield or increase or even be maintained over time.

We make distributions based on a number of factors, including an estimate of taxable earnings. Dividends distributed and taxable income will typically differ from GAAP earnings due to items such as
 fair value adjustments, differences in premium amortization and discount accretion, and nondeductible general and administrative expenses. Our common dividend per share may be substantially different than our taxable earnings and GAAP earnings
 per share. Our GAAP loss per diluted share for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 was 0.49 and 0.06, respectively.

Management Agreement

The Management Agreement with our Manager provides that our Manager is entitled to receive a management fee, the reimbursement of certain expenses and, in certain circumstances, a termination fee. The
 management fee is an amount equal to 1.5 per annum of our stockholders equity, adjusted as set forth in the Management Agreement, and calculated and payable quarterly in arrears. We will also be required to pay a termination fee equal to three
 times the average annual management fee earned by our Manager during the two four-quarter periods ending as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to the effective date of the termination. Such termination fee will be
 payable upon termination or non-renewal of the Management Agreement by us without cause or by our Manager if we materially breach the Management Agreement. The Management Agreement requires the Company and the Manager to terminate the Management
 Agreement without payment of any termination fee pursuant to the consummation of an internalization event (as defined in the Management Agreement).

We pay all of our direct operating expenses, except those specifically required to be borne by our Manager under the Management Agreement. Our Manager is responsible for all costs incident to the
 performance of its duties under the Management Agreement. We believe that our Manager uses the proceeds from its management fee in part to pay the Services Provider for services provided under the Services Agreement. Our officers receive no cash
 compensation directly from us. Our Manager provides us with our officers. Our Manager is entitled to be reimbursed for an agreed upon portion of the costs of the wages, salary and other benefits with respect to our chief financial officer, and,
 prior to January 1, 2022, our general counsel, originally based on the percentages of their working time and efforts spent on matters related to the Company. The amount of the wages, salary and benefits reimbursed with respect to the officers our
 Manager provides to us is subject to the approval of the compensation committee of our board of directors.

The term of the Management Agreement expires on October 22, 2025 and will be automatically renewed for a one-year term on each anniversary of such date thereafter unless terminated or not renewed as
 described below. Either we or our Manager may elect not to renew the Management Agreement upon expiration of its initial term or any renewal term by providing written notice of non-renewal at least 180 days, but not more than 270 days, before
 expiration. In the event we elect not to renew the term, we will be required to pay our Manager the termination fee described above unless such non-renewal occurs in connection with the consummation of an internalization event. We may terminate
 the Management Agreement at any time for cause effective upon 30 days prior written notice of termination from us to our Manager, in which case no termination fee would be due. Our board of directors will review our Manager s performance prior to
 the automatic renewal of the Management Agreement and, as a result of such review, upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the members of our board of directors or of the holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock, we may
 terminate the Management Agreement based upon unsatisfactory performance by our Manager that is materially detrimental to us or a determination by our independent directors that the management fees payable to our Manager are not fair, subject to
 the right of our Manager to prevent such a termination by agreeing to a reduction of the management fees payable to our Manager. Upon any termination of the Management Agreement based on unsatisfactory performance or unfair management fees, we
 are required to pay our Manager the termination fee described above. Our Manager may terminate the Management Agreement, without payment of the termination fee, in the event we become regulated as an investment company under the Investment
 Company Act. Our Manager may also terminate the Management Agreement upon 60 days written notice if we default in the performance of any material term of the Management Agreement and the default continues for a period of 30 days after written
 notice to us, whereupon we would be required to pay our Manager the termination fee described above.

On July 9, 2024, the Company announced that the special committee of the Company s board of directors, which committee is comprised entirely of independent and disinterested members of the board,
 after consultation with its independent legal and financial advisors and as part of the special committee s previously announced exploration of strategic alternatives, determined and recommended to the board of directors that it is advisable and
 in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to internalize management of the Company, terminate the Management Agreement and take all steps necessary to begin operating the Company as a fully integrated, internally managed mortgage
 REIT. Following such recommendation from the special committee, the Company s board of directors authorized and approved the Internalization and authorized and directed the Company s officers to take all actions necessary to cause the Company to
 effect the Internalization.

Table of Contents 

On July 11, 2024, we received a letter from counsel to the Manager informing us that it is the Manager s position that no termination of the Management Agreement may be declared based on an
 Internalization Event absent the agreement of the Manager, no Internalization Event has occurred and, as a result of our July 9, 2024 announcement, the contractual termination fee in the amount of approximately 18.4 million is due. On July 17,
 2024, counsel to the special committee responded to the Manager and denied the assertions made by the Manager s counsel and explained that the Internalization Event would not require the payment of a termination fee pursuant to the plain terms
 of the Management Agreement. At this time, it is not known whether this matter will result in litigation. Should this matter result in litigation, the Company intends to vigorously contest this matter.

Subservicing Agreements

As of September 30, 2024, Aurora had four subservicing agreements in place, one of which is with Freedom Mortgage. Following the sale of the Ginnie Mae MSRs to Freedom Mortgage in June 2020, Freedom
 Mortgage continued to subservice certain loans that had been purchased from Ginnie Mae pools due to delinquency or default. Freedom Mortgage ceased subservicing these loans during 2021 because these loans and any related advance claims had been
 rehabilitated or liquidated. One of the other subservicing agreements is with RoundPoint. Freedom Mortgage acquired RoundPoint and it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Freedom Mortgage in August 2020. On September 30, 2023, RoundPoint ceased
 being a wholly owned subsidiary of Freedom Mortgage when it was acquired by an unaffiliated entity, Matrix Financial Services Corporation. The agreements have varying initial terms (three years, for Freedom Mortgage, and two years for the other
 three sub-servicers) and are subject to automatic renewal for additional terms equal to the applicable initial term unless either party chooses not to renew. Each agreement may be terminated without cause by either party by giving notice as
 specified in the agreement. If an agreement is not renewed by the Company or terminated by the Company without cause, de-boarding fees will be due to the subservicer. Under each agreement, the subservicer agrees to service the applicable mortgage
 loans in accordance with applicable law and the requirements of the applicable Agency and the Company pays customary fees to the applicable subservicer for specified services. All expiring agreements to date have been automatically renewed for
 the extended terms.

Joint Marketing Recapture Agreement

We attempt to reduce the exposure of our MSRs to voluntary prepayments through the structuring of recapture agreements with Aurora s subservicers.

In May 2018, Aurora entered into a recapture purchase and sale agreement with RoundPoint, one of Aurora s subservicers and from August 2020 to September 2023, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Freedom
 Mortgage. Pursuant to this agreement, RoundPoint attempts to refinance certain mortgage loans underlying Aurora s MSR portfolio subserviced by RoundPoint as directed by Aurora. If a loan is refinanced, RoundPoint will sell the loan to Fannie Mae
 or Freddie Mac, as applicable, retain the sale proceeds and transfer the related MSR to Aurora. During the period where RoundPoint was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Freedom Mortgage, RoundPoint outsourced such recapture services to Freedom
 Mortgage on RoundPoint s behalf.

Inflation

Substantially all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors affect our performance more so than inflation, although inflation rates can often
 have a meaningful influence over the direction of interest rates. As discussed above under Effects of Federal Reserve Policy on the Company , the Federal Reserve has started reducing its federal funds rate target and otherwise easing monetary
 policy based on improved inflation data. The Federal Reserve s actions may decrease interest rates across asset classes and our interest expense and, thereby, increase our interest income. If the Federal Reserve decides to tighten monetary policy
 in the future, it may increase our interest expense, which expense may not be fully offset by any resulting increase in our interest income. Furthermore, our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions are
 determined by our board of directors primarily based on our REIT taxable income, and, in each case, our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation.

Item 3. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets, interest rates, liquidity, prepayment speeds and market value while, at the same time, seeking to provide an opportunity to
 stockholders to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns through ownership of our capital stock. While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we believe the risk can be quantified from historical experience and seek to actively manage that
 risk, to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our
 control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our assets and our related financing obligations. In general, we finance the acquisition of certain of our assets through financings in the form of repurchase agreements and bank
 facilities. We expect to make use of additional MSR financing, as well as possibly warehouse facilities, securitizations, re-securitizations, and public and private equity and debt issuances in addition to transaction or asset specific funding
 arrangements. In addition, the values of our Servicing Related Assets are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, historically increasing when rates rise and decreasing when rates decline. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a
 REIT, we attempt to mitigate interest rate risk and financing pricing risk through utilization of hedging instruments, primarily interest rate swap agreements and U.S. treasury futures, respectively. We may also use financial futures, options,
 interest rate cap agreements, and forward sales. These instruments are intended to serve as a hedge against future interest rate or pricing changes on our borrowings.

Interest Rate Effect on Net Interest Income

Our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing and hedging activities. The costs of our borrowings are generally based on
 prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally will increase (1) while the yields earned on our leveraged fixed-rate mortgage assets will remain static and (2) at a faster pace than the
 yields earned on our leveraged adjustable-rate and hybrid adjustable-rate RMBS, which could result in a decline in our net interest spread and net interest margin. The severity of any such decline would depend on our asset/liability composition
 at the time as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase. Further, an increase in short-term interest rates could also have a negative impact on the market value of our assets, other than our Servicing Related Assets. A
 decrease in interest rates could have a negative impact on the market value of our Servicing Related Assets. If any of these events happen, we could experience a decrease in net income or incur a net loss during these periods, which could
 adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.

Hedging techniques are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our assets, specifically our RMBS. If prepayments are slower or faster than assumed, the life of the investment will be longer
 or shorter, which would reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions. Hedging strategies involving the use of derivatives are highly complex and may produce volatile returns.

Interest Rate Cap Risk

Any adjustable-rate RMBS that we acquire will generally be subject to interest rate caps, which potentially could cause such RMBS to acquire many of the characteristics of fixed-rate securities if
 interest rates were to rise above the cap levels. This issue will be magnified to the extent we acquire adjustable-rate and hybrid adjustable-rate RMBS that are not based on mortgages which are fully indexed. In addition, adjustable-rate and
 hybrid adjustable-rate RMBS may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding. This could result in our receipt of less cash income on such assets than we
 would need to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings. To mitigate interest rate mismatches, we may utilize the hedging strategies discussed above under Interest Rate Risk . Actual economic conditions or implementation of decisions by
 our Manager may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models.

The sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is presented solely to assist an analysis of the possible effects on the fair value under various scenarios. It is not a prediction of the amount or
 likelihood of a change in any particular scenario. In particular, the results are calculated by stressing a particular economic assumption independent of changes in any other assumption. In practice, changes in one factor may result in changes in
 another, which might counteract or amplify the sensitivities. In addition, changes in the fair value based on a 10 variation in an assumption generally may not be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the
 change in fair value may not be linear.

Counterparty Risk

When we engage in repurchase transactions, we generally sell securities to lenders (i.e., the repurchase agreement counterparties) and receive cash from the lenders. The lenders are obligated to
 resell the same securities back to us at the end of the term of the transaction. Because the cash we receive from the lender when we initially sell the securities to the lender is less than the value of those securities (this difference is the
 haircut), if the lender defaults on its obligation to resell the same securities back to us we would incur a loss on the transaction equal to the amount of the haircut (assuming there was no change in the value of the securities). As of September
 30, 2024, the Company s exposure (defined as the amount of cash and securities pledged as collateral, less the borrowing under the repurchase agreement) to any of the counterparties under the repurchase agreements did not exceed five percent of
 the Company s equity.

Our interest rate swaps and U.S. treasury futures contracts are required to be cleared on an exchange which greatly mitigates, but does not entirely eliminate, counterparty risk.

Our investments in Servicing Related Assets are dependent on the applicable mortgage sub-servicer to perform its sub-servicing obligations. If our sub-servicer fails to perform its obligations and is
 terminated by one or more Agencies as an approved servicer, the value of the MSRs being subserviced by that sub-servicer may be adversely affected. In addition, when we purchase MSRs from third parties, we rely, to a certain extent, on the
 ability and willingness of the sellers to perform their contractual obligations to remedy breaches of representations and warranties or to repurchase the affected loan and indemnify us for any losses.

73 

Table of Contents 

Funding Risk

To the extent available on desirable terms, we expect to continue to finance our RMBS with repurchase agreement financing. We also anticipate continuing to finance our MSRs with bank loans secured by
 a pledge of those MSRs. Over time, as market conditions change, in addition to these financings, we may use other forms of leverage. Weakness in the financial markets, the residential mortgage markets and the economy generally could adversely
 affect one or more of our potential lenders and could cause one or more of our potential lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing or to increase the costs of that financing.

Liquidity Risk

Our Servicing Related Assets, as well as some of the assets that may in the future comprise our portfolio, are not publicly traded. A portion of these assets may be subject to legal and other
 restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of these assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises, including in response to changes in economic
 and other conditions.

Credit Risk

Although we expect relatively low credit risk with respect to our portfolio of Agency RMBS, our investments in MSRs and any CMOs we may acquire expose us to the credit risk of borrowers.

Inflation Risk

Almost all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates and other factors drive our performance more directly than does inflation. However, changes in
 interest rates generally correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates, and therefore adverse changes in inflation or changes in inflation expectations can lead to lower returns on our investments than originally anticipated. Our
 consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our activities and consolidated balance sheets are measured primarily with reference to fair value without considering inflation.
