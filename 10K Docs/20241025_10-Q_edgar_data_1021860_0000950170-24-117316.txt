The Company s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. A majority of the Company s international entities in which there is a substantial investment have the local currency as their functional currency. As a result, currency translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the entities financial statements into the reporting currency are reported in other comprehensive income (loss). The effect of changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, until the underlying transactions are realized. The movement in other comprehensive income (loss) from period to period will be the combination of: 1) changes in fair value of open derivatives of million during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 ; and, 2) the outflow of other comprehensive loss related to cumulative changes in the fair value of derivatives that have settled in the current period, which were million and million the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

Sales from one segment to another generally are priced at estimated equivalent commercial selling prices; however, segments originating an external sale are credited with the full profit to the Company. Eliminations include intercompany transactions conducted between the reporting segments that are eliminated in consolidation. Intrasegment transactions are eliminated within each segment. Total other items included in operating profit were an expense of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to severance pay, and a credit of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to gains from divestiture of the Company's Pole Products business in the Energy Equipment segment. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, total other items included in operating profit were an expense of million, primarily related to a voluntary early retirement program, and a credit of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to gains on the sale of previously reserved inventory. 

strategic acquisitions to enhance and expand our existing portfolio for a total consideration of million, net of cash acquired. One of the two acquisitions was a company owned by White Deer Energy, a middle market private equity fund focused on energy investments. As the transaction involved a related party at the time it was entered into (e.g., directors Ben A. Guill and Eric L. Mattson both had an investment interest in certain White Deer Energy funds), the acquisition was approved by the disinterested members of the Company s Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2024 , we provisionally recorded million of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets; million of PP E, including financing and operating lease right of use assets; million of net working capital; million of finance and operating lease liabilities, and million in other liabilities. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary and subject to change until we finalize our accounting for these acquisitions. On April 9, 2024, NOV completed the divestiture of its Pole Products business. Pole Products is a leading manufacturer of premium spun-cast concrete and tapered steel poles for diverse applications. We recorded a gain of million, which is included as a reduction of Cost of Revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the second quarter, the Company purchased the remaining noncontrolling interest in Keystone Tower Systems for total consideration of million.

Performance Obligations Net revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods was immaterial for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to change orders. Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of firm orders for all revenue streams for which work has not been performed on contracts with original expected duration of one year or more. We do not disclose the remaining performance obligations of royalty contracts, service contracts for which there is a right to invoice, and short-term contracts that are expected to have a duration of one year or less. As of September 30, 2024 , the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was million. Although numerous factors can affect timing of revenue recognized on performance obligations, such as customer change orders and supplier accelerations or delays, the Company expects to recognize approximately million in revenue for the remaining performance obligations in the remainder of 2024 , million in 2025 , million in 2026 , and million thereafter . Contract Assets and Liabilities Contract assets include unbilled amounts when revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer under contracts where revenue is recognized over time. Contract liabilities consist of customer billings in excess of revenue recognized under over-time contracts, customer advance payments and deferred revenue.

million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company is currently pursuing litigation against certain non-paying licensees, which will impact our ability to collect the receivables timely. As such, revenue and the related receivables are recorded at a discount to reflect the delayed timing of future cash collections. As of September 30, 2024 , the receivables of million, net of allowances of million for credit losses and million for the remaining timing related discount, are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These allowances do not impact the amount the Company is entitled to recover on its claims from the licensees in litigation. While we continue to believe it is probable the Company will collect all or substantially all of the consideration to which it is entitled pursuant to the terms of the licensing agreements, the Company will also continue to evaluate the credit quality of the receivables. See Note 15 for discussion of the ongoing litigation. Allowance for Credit Losses The Company estimates its allowance for credit losses using information about past events, current conditions and risk characteristics of each customer, and reasonable and supportable forecasts relevant to assessing risk associated with the collectability of receivables and contract assets. The Company s customer base, mostly in the oil and gas industry, have generally similar collectability risk characteristics, although larger and state-owned customers may have lower risk than smaller independent customers. As of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses totaled million.

On September 12, 2024, the Company entered into a new billion unsecured revolving credit facility. This new credit facility replaced the Company's previous billion revolving credit facility. The Company has the right to increase the aggregate commitments under this new agreement to an aggregate amount of up to billion upon the consent of only those lenders holding any such increase. Interest under the multicurrency facility is based upon plus subject to a ratings-based grid or the U.S. prime rate. The new credit facility contains a financial covenant establishing a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio of . As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of and had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credits issued under the facility, resulting in billion of available funds. A consolidated joint venture of the Company borrowed million against a million bank line of credit for the construction of a facility in Saudi Arabia. Interest under the bank line of credit is based upon SOFR plus . The bank line of credit contains a financial covenant regarding maximum debt-to-equity ratio of . As of September 30, 2024 , the joint venture was in compliance. The facility construction was completed in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the joint venture will not have future borrowings on the line of credit. The line of credit repayment schedule began in with final payment no later than . As of September 30, 2024, the Company has million in borrowings related to this line of credit. The carrying value of debt under the Company s consolidated joint venture approximates fair value because the interest rates are variable and reflective of current market rates. The Company has million in payments related to this line of credit due in the next twelve months. The Company can repay the entire outstanding facility balance without penalty at its sole discretion. Other debt at September 30, 2024 included million of amounts owed to current and former minority interest partners of NOV consolidated joint ventures, of which million is due in the next twelve months. The Company had million of outstanding letters of credit at September 30, 2024, primarily in Norway and the United States, that are under various bilateral letter of credit facilities. Letters of credit are issued as bid bonds, advanced payment bonds and performance bonds. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the fair value of the Company s unsecured Senior Notes approximated million and million, respectively. The fair value of the Company s debt is estimated using Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy and is based on quoted prices for those of similar instruments. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the carrying value of the Company s unsecured Senior Notes approximated million and million, respectively.

and , respectively, compared to and for the same periods in 2023. The effective tax rate for 2024 was negatively impacted by a mix of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions, losses in certain jurisdictions with no tax benefit, and adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets, partially offset by the reduction of valuation allowances related to U.S. and state deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for 2023 was positively impacted by the utilization of previously unrealized loss carryforwards and tax credits as well as favorable adjustments related to changes in certain exchange rates, partially offset by current year losses in certain jurisdictions with no tax benefit. 

million. The NOV Plan is also subject to a fungible ratio concept, such that the issuance of stock options and stock appreciation rights reduces the number of available shares under the NOV Plan on a 1-for-1 basis, and the issuance of other awards reduces the number of available shares under the NOV Plan on a 1.5-for-1 basis. At September 30, 2024 , approximately million shares remained available for future grants under the NOV Plan. The Company also has outstanding awards under its former stock-based compensation plan known as the National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Former Plan ), however the Company is no longer granting new awards under the Former Plan. Total expense for all stock-based compensation arrangements was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The total income tax expense/(benefit) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for stock-based compensation arrangements was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively.

However, depending on U.S cash balances, the Company may choose to borrow against its revolving credit facility or issue new debt to finance the repurchases. As shares are repurchased, they are constructively retired and returned to an unissued state. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company repurchased million shares of common stock under the program for an aggregate amount of million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company repurchased million shares of common stock under the program for an aggregate amount of million.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Introduction 
 NOV Inc. NOV or the Company is a leading independent equipment and technology provider to the global energy industry. Originally founded in 1862, NOV and its predecessor companies have spent 162 years helping transform oil and gas field development and improving its cost-effectiveness, efficiency, safety, and environmental impact. Over the past few decades, the Company has pioneered and refined key technologies to improve the economic viability of frontier resources, including unconventional and deepwater oil and gas. More recently, by applying its deep expertise and technology, the company has helped advance the transition toward sustainable energy. 
 NOV s extensive proprietary technology portfolio supports the industry s full-field drilling, completion, and production needs. With unmatched cross-segment capabilities, scope, and scale, NOV continues to develop and introduce technologies that further enhance the economics and efficiencies of energy production, with a focus on automation, predictive analytics, and condition-based maintenance. 
 NOV serves major-diversified, national, and independent service companies, contractors, and energy producers in 60 countries. Effective January 1, 2024, NOV consolidated its reporting structure into two segments: Energy Products and Services, and Energy Equipment. Segment disclosures pertaining to prior periods have been restated to reflect the change in reportable segments. 
 Results of operations are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial information in order to conform with current period presentation. The Company discloses Adjusted EBITDA (defined as operating profit excluding depreciation, amortization, gains and losses on sales of fixed assets and, when applicable, Other Items) in its periodic earnings press releases and other public disclosures to provide investors additional information about the results of ongoing operations. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations in Results of Operations for an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to their corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 Energy Products and Services 
 The Company s Energy Products and Services segment primarily designs, manufactures, rents, and sells products and equipment used in drilling, intervention, completion, and production activities. Products include drill bits, downhole tools, premium drill pipe, drilling fluids, managed pressure drilling, integral and weld-on connectors for conductor strings and surface casing, completion tools, and artificial lift systems. The segment also designs, manufactures, and delivers high-end composite pipe, tanks, and structures engineered to solve both corrosion and weight challenges in a wide variety of applications, including oil and gas, chemical, industrial, wastewater, fuel handling, marine and offshore, and rare earth mineral extraction. 
 In addition to product and equipment sales, the segment provides services, software, and digital solutions to improve drilling and completion operational performance. Services include tubular inspection and coating, solids control, waste management , and managed pressure drilling. Software and digital solutions offered include drilling and completion optimization and remote monitoring (via downhole and surface instrumentation), wired drill pipe services, software controls and applications, and data management and analytics services at the edge and in the cloud. 
 Energy Products and Services serves oil and gas companies, drilling contractors, oilfield service companies, oilfield equipment rental companies and developers of geothermal energy. Demand for the segment s products and services primarily depends on the level of oilfield drilling activity by oil and gas companies, drilling contractors, and oilfield service companies. Demand for the segment s composite solutions serving applications outside of oil and gas are driven by industrial activity, infrastructure spend, and population growth. 
 Energy Equipment 
 The Company s Energy Equipment segment manufactures and supports the capital equipment and integrated systems needed for oil and gas exploration and production, both onshore and offshore, as well as for other marine-based, industrial and renewable energy markets. 
 The segment designs, manufactures, and integrates technologies for drilling and producing oil and gas wells. This includes equipment and technologies needed for drilling, including land rigs, offshore drilling equipment packages, drilling rig components, and software control systems that mechanize and automate the drilling process and rig functionality; hydraulic fracture stimulation, including pressure pumping trucks, blenders, sanders, hydration units, injection units, flowline, and manifolds; well intervention, including coiled tubing units, coiled tubing, and wireline units and tools; cementing products for pumping, mixing, transport, and storage; onshore production, including fluid processing, and surface transfer as well as progressive cavity pumps; offshore production, including integrated production systems and subsea production technologies; and aftermarket support of these technologies, providing spare parts, service, and repair. 
 Energy Equipment primarily serves contract drillers, oilfield service companies, and oil and gas companies. Demand for the segment s products primarily depends on capital spending plans by drilling contractors, service companies, and oil and gas companies; and secondarily on the overall level of oilfield drilling, completions, and workover activity which drives demand for equipment, spare parts, service, and repair for the segment s large installed base of equipment. 
 19 

The segment also serves marine and offshore markets, where it designs and builds equipment for wind turbine installation and cable lay vessels, and offers heavy lift cranes and jacking systems; industrial markets, where the segment provides pumps and mixers for a wide breadth of industrial end markets; and other energy transition markets, where it is applying its gas processing expertise to provide solutions that aid in wind power development, hydrogen production and carbon sequestration. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 In our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified our most critical accounting policies. In preparing the financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition under long-term construction contracts, impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable. The combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material. 
 
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 For the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated revenues of 2.19 billion, an increase of 6 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Net income increased 14 percent to 130 million, or 5.9 percent of sales, an increase of 16 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Operating profit increased 11 million from the prior year to 194 million, or 8.9 percent of sales. The company recorded 5 million within Other Items, primarily related to severance pay. Adjusted EBITDA (operating profit excluding depreciation, amortization, gains and losses on sales of fixed assets and, when applicable, Other Items) increased 7 percent year-over-year to 286 million, or 13.1 percent of sales. 
 Segment Performance 
 Energy Products and Services 
 Energy Products and Services generated revenues of 1,003 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 3 percent from the third quarter of 2023. Operating profit decreased 31 million from the prior year to 114 million, or 11.4 percent of sales, and included 3 million in Other Items. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 25 million from the prior year to 172 million, or 17.1 percent of sales. The decrease in revenue and profit was primarily due to lower drilling activity levels in North America, partially offset by contributions from the Company's recent artificial lift acquisition.. 
 Energy Equipment 
 Energy Equipment generated revenues of 1,219 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 2 percent from the third quarter of 2023. Operating profit increased 31 million from the prior year to 129 million, or 10.6 percent of sales, and included 1 million in Other Items. Adjusted EBITDA increased 35 million from the prior year to 159 million, or 13.0 percent of sales. Improved profitability was the result of strong execution on the segment s improving backlog and better demand for aftermarket parts and services. 
 New orders booked during the quarter totaled 627 million, an increase of 79 million when compared to the 548 million of new orders booked during the third quarter of 2023. Orders shipped from backlog in the third quarter of 2024 were 563 million, representing a book-to-bill of 111 percent, compared to the 537 million orders shipped and a book-to-bill of 102 percent in the third quarter of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, backlog for capital equipment orders for Energy Equipment was 4,478 million, an increase of 485 million from the third quarter of 2023.

Oil Gas Equipment and Services Market and Outlook 
 The macro environment and geopolitical uncertainties continue to drive volatility and pressure commodity prices with oil prices reflecting growing concerns regarding diminishing demand from weakening global economies, excess OPEC capacity, and rising non-OPEC production. These concerns along with ample supplies of natural gas in North America are increasing cautiousness among oil and gas producers, resulting in lower drilling activity in the U.S. land market and are beginning to affect shorter-cycle activity in international markets. 
 Despite growing concerns that global oil and U.S. natural gas markets may be oversupplied in 2025, management believes commodity prices and activity levels should remain relatively rangebound, with any pullback in activity short-lived, and that the industry remains in an extended recovery due to: (1) current inventory levels in relation to OECD demand that are lower than historical averages; (2) natural oil production decline rates that average almost 15 percent; (3) anticipated increases in LNG exports from the U.S.; (4) increasing focus on energy security; and (5) capital discipline across the industry, which has diminished the global oil and gas industry s ability to easily ramp production. 
 Regardless of the operating environment, NOV remains committed to improving organizational efficiencies while focusing on the development and commercialization of innovative products and services, including technologies to reduce the environmental impact of oil and gas operations, and technologies to accelerate the energy transition that are responsive to the longer-term needs of NOV s customers. We believe this strategy will further advance the Company s competitive position in all market conditions. 
 Operating Environment Overview 
 The Company s results are dependent on, among other things, the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling, well remediation activity, the prices of crude oil and natural gas, capital spending by exploration and production companies and drilling contractors, worldwide oil and gas inventory levels and, to a lesser degree, the level of investment in wind and geothermal energy products. Key industry indicators for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, and the second quarter of 2024 include the following:

Energy Products and Services 
 t hree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Revenue from Energy Products and Services was 1,003 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,034 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 31 million or 3 percent. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from Energy Products and Services was 3,070 million compared to 3,004 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 66 million or 2 percent. The decrease in revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to an increase in North America revenue of 1 percent offset by a decrease in international revenue of 5 percent. North American revenue increased despite the decline in drilling activity primarily due to the acquisition of our artificial lift business and market share gains, while international revenue declined primarily due to lower sales of drill pipe and conductor pipe connections. The increase in revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to increases in North America and international revenue of 4 percent and 2 percent, respectively. The growth in North America was primarily due to the acquisition of our artificial lift business and market share gains, and the growth in international revenue was primarily due to higher activity levels in international markets, partially offset by lower sales of drill pipe and conductor pipe connections. 
 Operating profit from Energy Products and Services was 114 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an operating profit of 145 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 31 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating profit from Energy Products and Services was 363 million compared to operating profit of 413 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2023, a decrease of 50 million. The decrease in profitability was due to a less favorable sales mix, including a 35 percent decline in sales of drill pipe in the third quarter of 2024 and a 17 percent decline year-to-date when compared to the prior year. 
 Energy Equipment 
 t hree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Revenue from Energy Equipment was 1,219 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,195 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 24 million or 2 percent. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from Energy Equipment was 3,601 million compared to 3,364 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 237 million or 7 percent. The increase in revenue is attributable to higher sales in both international land and offshore markets. Revenue improved from international sales by 1 percent in the third quarter of 2024 and 11 percent year-to-date when compared to the prior year, and offshore sales increased by 3 percent in the third quarter of 2024 and by 14 percent year-to-date when compared to the prior year. The increase in sales to these markets is a result of strong demand for aftermarket products and services and execution on the segment s improving capital equipment backlog. Revenues in North America increased 6 percent in the third quarter of 2024 on strong sales of capital equipment but declined 3 percent year-to-date when compared to the prior year, primarily due to the divestiture of the segment s Pole Products business during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Operating profit from Energy Equipment was 129 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an operating profit of 98 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 31 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating profit from Energy Equipment was 456 million compared to operating profit of 250 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 206 million. Higher profitability for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was the result of higher margin sales primarily driven by improved demand for aftermarket products and services and strong execution on the segment s improving capital equipment backlog. A 131 million gain from the divestiture of the segment s Pole Products business in the second quarter of 2024 also contributed to the increase in profitability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 23 

The Energy Equipment segment monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when the Company receives a firm written order for major completion and production components or a contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was 4,478 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 485 million from backlog of 3,993 million at September 30, 2023. Although numerous factors can affect the timing of revenue out of backlog (including, but not limited to, customer change orders and supplier accelerations or delays), the Company reasonably expects approximately 13 percent of backlog to become revenue during the rest of 2024 and the remainder thereafter. At September 30, 2024, approximately 53 percent of the capital equipment backlog was for offshore products and approximately 91 percent of the capital equipment backlog was destined for international markets. 
 Eliminations and corporate costs 
 Eliminations and corporate costs were 49 million and 150 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 60 million and 173 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Sales from one segment to another generally are priced at estimated equivalent commercial selling prices; however, segments originating an external sale are credited with the full profit to the company. Eliminations include intercompany transactions conducted between the two reporting segments that are eliminated in consolidation. Intrasegment transactions are eliminated within each segment. Eliminations declined 20 percent when compared to the third quarter of 2023 and 14 percent year-to-date due to lower intrasegment activity. 
 Corporate costs declined 15 percent from the third quarter of 2023 and 13 percent year-to-date due to our cost savings initiatives and workforce reductions. 
 Interest and financial costs and Interest Income 
 Interest and financial costs were 21 million and 67 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 23 million and 65 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes were primarily due to fluctuations in debt balances between periods. 
 Interest income was 11 million and 27 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5 million and 21 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to interest earned on larger cash balances in the current year compared to prior year. 
 Equity income in unconsolidated affiliates 
 Equity income in unconsolidated affiliates was 0 million and 37 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16 million and 101 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. A less favorable product sales mix and lower volume in sales led to lower profitability year-over-year for our largest investment in unconsolidated affiliates. 
 Other expense, net 
 Other expense, net was 10 million and 34 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 25 million and 70 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The change in expense was primarily due to larger foreign currency fluctuations in the prior year, particularly with the currency devaluation in Argentina. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 25.3 and 25.0 , respectively, compared to 30.8 and 18.2 for the same periods in 2023. The effective tax rate for 2024 was negatively impacted by a mix of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions, losses in certain jurisdictions with no tax benefit, and adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets, partially offset by the reduction of valuation allowances related to U.S. and state deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for 2023 was positively impacted by the utilization of previously unrealized loss carryforwards and tax credits as well as favorable adjustments related to changes in certain exchange rates, partially offset by current year losses in certain jurisdictions with no tax benefit.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations 
 This Form 10-Q contains certain non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful tools for internal use and the investment community in evaluating NOV s overall financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are broadly used to value and compare companies in the oilfield services and equipment industry. Not all companies define these measures in the same way. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should therefore be considered only as supplemental to such GAAP financial measures. 
 The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as operating profit excluding depreciation, amortization, gains and losses on sales of fixed assets and, when applicable, Other Items. Adjusted EBITDA is a ratio showing Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Management believes this is important information to provide because it is used by management to evaluate the Company s operational performance and trends between periods and manage the business. Management also believes this information may be useful to investors and analysts to gain a better understanding of the Company s results of ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to replace GAAP financial measures, such as Net Income and Operating Profit . 
 Additionally, Excess Free Cash Flow does not represent the Company's residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as the calculation of these measures does not account for certain debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 985 million and total debt of 1,749 million. At December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were 816 million and total debt was 1,725 million. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 534 million of the 985 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries and the earnings associated with this cash could be subject to foreign withholding taxes and incremental U.S. taxation if transferred among countries or repatriated to the U.S. If opportunities to invest in the U.S. are greater than available cash balances that are not subject to income tax, rather than repatriating cash, the Company may choose to borrow against its revolving credit facility. 
 On September 12, 2024, the Company entered into a new 1.5 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility. This new credit facility replaced the Company's previous 2.0 billion revolving credit facility. The Company has the right to increase the aggregate commitments under this new agreement to an aggregate amount of up to 2.5 billion upon the consent of only those lenders holding any such increase. Interest under the multicurrency facility is based upon Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA), Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA), or Norwegian Interbank Offered Rate (NIBOR), plus 1.25 subject to a ratings-based grid or the U.S. prime rate. The new credit facility contains a financial covenant establishing a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60 . As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 23.4 and had no borrowings or letters of credits issued under the facility, resulting in 1.5 billion of available funds. 
 Additionally, a consolidated joint venture of the Company borrowed 120 million against a 150 million bank line of credit for the construction of a facility in Saudi Arabia. Interest under the bank line of credit is based upon SOFR plus 1.40 . The bank line of credit contains a financial covenant regarding maximum debt-to-equity ratio of 75 . As of September 30, 2024, the joint venture was in compliance. The facility construction was completed in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the joint venture will not have future borrowings on the line of credit. The line of credit repayment schedule began in December 2022 with final payment no later than June 2032. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 99 million in borrowings related to this line of credit. The Company has 11 million in payments related to this line of credit due in the next twelve months. 
 The Company s outstanding debt at September 30, 2024 consisted of 1,091 million in 3.95 Senior Notes, 496 million in 3.60 Senior Notes, and other debt of 162 million. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2024. Long-term lease liabilities totaled 551 million at September 30, 2024. 
 The Company had 472 million of outstanding letters of credit at September 30, 2024, primarily in Norway and the United States, that are under various bilateral letter of credit facilities. Letters of credit are issued as bid bonds, advanced payment bonds and performance bonds. 
 The following table summarizes our net cash provided by (used in) continuing operating activities, continuing investing activities and continuing financing activities for the periods presented (in millions):

Significant uses of cash during the first nine months of 2024 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities were 713 million, primarily driven by higher levels of profitability and changes in the primary components of our working capital (receivables, inventories, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities). 

Capital expenditures were 233 million. 

Business acquisitions, net of cash, were 252 million. 

Payments of 79 million in dividends to our shareholders. 

Share repurchases were 117 million. 

Other 
 The effect of the change in exchange rates on cash flows was a decrease of 1 million for the first nine months of 2024, and a decrease of 5 million for the first nine months of 2023. 
 We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facilities and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund operations, lease payments, working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, dividends and financing obligations. 
 27 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 4.6 million shares of common stock under its stock program for an aggregate amount of 80 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock under the program for an aggregate amount of 117 million. The Company expects to return at least 50 of Excess Free Cash Flow (defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and other investments, including acquisitions), through a combination of steady, quarterly base dividends, opportunistic stock buybacks, and an annual supplemental dividend to true-up returns to shareholders on an annual basis. 
 We may pursue additional acquisition candidates, but the timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted. We continue to expect to fund future cash acquisitions primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings, including the unborrowed portion of the revolving credit facility or new debt issuances, but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions. There can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor provisions for forward-looking information. Some of the information in this document contains, or has incorporated by reference, forward-looking statements. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically are identified by use of terms such as may, believe, plan, will, expect, anticipate, estimate, should, forecast, and similar words, although some forward-looking statements are expressed differently. We may also provide oral or written forward-looking information in other materials we release to the public. Forward-looking information involves risk and uncertainties and reflects our best judgment based on current information. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from results anticipated in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in oil and gas prices, customer demand for our products and worldwide economic activity, including matters related to recent Russian sanctions. Given these uncertainties, current or prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any such factors or forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. You should also consider carefully the statements under Risk Factors, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-end December 31, 2023, as updated in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which address additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, and additional disclosures we make in our press releases and Forms 10-Q, and 8-K. We also suggest that you listen to our quarterly earnings release conference calls with financial analysts.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Additional information concerning each of these matters follows: 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 We have extensive operations in foreign countries. The net assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, although such fluctuations have a muted effect on net income since the functional currency for the majority of them is the local currency. These operations also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency, which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income. We recorded a foreign exchange loss in our income statement of 27 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to a 58 million foreign exchange loss in the same period of the prior year. Gains and losses are primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and adjustments to our hedged positions as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may create losses in future periods to the extent we maintain net monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the NOV operation. 
 Some of our revenues in foreign countries are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those U.S. dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency. Similarly, some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, but have associated U.S. dollar costs, which also give rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure. In order to mitigate that risk, we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. 
 The Company had other financial market risk sensitive instruments (cash balances, overdraft facilities, accounts receivable and accounts payable) denominated in foreign currencies with transactional exposures totaling 520 million and translation exposures totaling 353 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10 movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on the transactional exposures could affect net income by 41 million and the translational exposures could affect Other Comprehensive Income by 35 million. 
 The counterparties to forward contracts are major financial institutions. The credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis. Because these contracts are net-settled the Company s credit risk with the counterparties is limited to the foreign currency rate differential at the end of the contract. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 At September 30, 2024, borrowings consisted of 1,091 million in 3.95 Senior Notes, 496 million in 3.60 Senior Notes, and other debt of 162 million. At September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding letters of credit issued under the Company's revolving credit facility, resulting in 1.5 billion of available funds. Additionally, the Company s joint venture has outstanding borrowings of 99 million under a 150 million bank line of credit for the construction of a facility in Saudi Arabia. Interest under the bank line of credit is based upon SOFR plus 1.40 . Occasionally a portion of borrowings under our credit facility could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market risk with exchange rate movements. These instruments carry interest at a pre-agreed upon percentage point spread from either SOFR, EURIBOR, SONIA, CORRA, or NIBOR, or at the U.S. prime rate. Under our credit facility, we may, at our option, fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over SOFR, EURIBOR, SONIA, CORRA or NIBOR for one month to six months. Our objective is to maintain a portion of our debt in variable rate borrowings for the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed-rate borrowings. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at a reasonable assurance level. 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
