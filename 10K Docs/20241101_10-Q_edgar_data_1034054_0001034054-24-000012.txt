 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure, including tower structures, rooftops, and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications, which we collectively refer to as towers or sites. Our principal operations are in the United States and its territories. In addition, we own and operate towers in South America, Central America, Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, and Tanzania. Our primary business line is our site leasing business, which contributed 98.5 of our total segment operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In our site leasing business, we (1) lease space to wireless service providers and other customers on assets that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 39,762 towers, a 

 23 
 Table of Contents 

substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. Our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks. Site Leasing Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts in the United States, South America, Central America, Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, and Tanzania. As of September 30, 2024, no U.S. state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total tower portfolio by tower count, and no U.S. state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, approximately 30 of our total towers are located in Brazil and no other international market (each country is considered a market) represented more than 5 of our total towers. We derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants. Wireless service providers enter into (1) individual tenant site leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site or (2) master lease agreements MLA with us, which provide for the material terms and conditions that will apply to multiple sites; although, in most cases, each individual site under a MLA is also governed by its own site leasing agreement which sets forth pricing and other site specific terms. Our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to fifteen years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant. Our tenant leases typically either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators, (2) escalate annually in accordance with an inflationary index, or (3) escalate using a combination of fixed and inflation adjusted escalators. In addition, our international site leases may include pass-through charges, such as rent related to ground leases and other property interests, utilities, property taxes, and fuel. Cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of: Cash and non-cash rental expense on ground leases, right-of-use, and other underlying property interests; Property taxes; Site maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs); Utilities; Property insurance; Fuel (in those international markets that do not have an available electric grid at our tower sites); and Lease initial direct cost amortization. Ground leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods, which are at our option. Our ground leases either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators or (2) escalate annually in accordance with an inflationary index. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 71 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years. For any given tower, costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. The amount of property taxes varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower. The ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems, painting a tower, or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing. In Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Panama, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures arising from our activities are denominated in U.S. dollars. Specifically, most of our ground leases and other property interests, tenant leases, and tower-related expenses are paid in U.S. dollars. In our Central American markets, our local currency obligations are principally limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities, and (3) taxes. In Brazil, Canada, Chile, South Africa, and the Philippines, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other property interests, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in local currency. In Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, and Tanzania, our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other property interests, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and U.S. dollars.

As indicated in the table below, our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report. For the three months ended For the nine months ended Segment operating profit as a percentage of September 30, September 30, total operating profit 2024 2023 2024 2023 Domestic site leasing 76.5 75.4 76.4 75.1 International site leasing 21.7 22.0 22.1 22.3 Total site leasing 98.2 97.4 98.5 97.4 
 We believe that the site leasing business continues to be attractive due to its long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high operating margins, and low customer churn (which refers to a lease that is non-renewed, cancelled, or discounted prior to the end of its term) other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of specific technology. We believe that over the long-term, site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion, and network coverage requirements. During the remainder of 2024, we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to increase over 2023 levels, on a currency neutral basis, due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum. We believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs, and minimal non-discretionary capital expenditures. Due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal. Consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by (1) adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and (2) executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment. Furthermore, because our towers are strategically positioned, we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of a specific technology. Site Development Our site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. Site development revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end-to-end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. Our services include: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure; (4) support in leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. We provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis, through regional, market, and project offices. The market offices are responsible for all site development operations. For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly report. Capital Allocation Strategy Our capital allocation strategy is aimed at increasing shareholder value through investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria, stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value, and by returning cash generated by our operations in the form of cash dividends. In addition, in a high interest rate environment and when we believe interest rates may stay higher for longer, we believe that debt repayments, especially of our variable rate debt, may be an accretive use of our excess capital. While the addition of cash dividends and debt repayments have provided us with additional tools to return value to our shareholders, we continue to believe that our priority is to make investments focused on increasing Adjusted Funds From Operations per share. Key elements of our capital allocation strategy include: Portfolio Growth. We intend to continue to grow our asset portfolio, domestically and internationally, primarily through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers that meet our internal return on invested capital criteria. Stock Repurchase Program. We currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our share price is below its intrinsic value. We believe that share repurchases, when purchased at the right price, will facilitate our goal of increasing our Adjusted Funds From Operations per share. 

 25 
 Table of Contents 

Dividend. Cash dividends are an additional component of our strategy of returning value to shareholders. We do not expect our dividend to require any changes in our leverage and believe that, due to our low dividend payout ratio, we can continue to focus on building and buying quality assets and opportunistically buying back our stock. While the timing and amount of future dividends will be subject to approval by our Board of Directors, we believe that our future cash flow generation will permit us to grow our cash dividend in the future. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have identified the policies and significant estimation processes listed below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for management s judgment in their application. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant. During the first quarter of 2024, we completed our assessment on the remaining estimated useful lives of our towers and intangible assets. We concluded through our assessment that, for U.S. GAAP purposes, we should modify our current estimates for asset lives based on our historical operating experience and the findings obtained by our independent consultant. We previously depreciated our towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the (i) term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or (ii) estimated useful life of a tower, which we had historically estimated to be 15 years. Based on our assessment, we revised the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets (which are amortized on a similar basis to our tower assets, as their useful lives correlate to the useful life of the towers) from 15 years to 30 years, effective January 1, 2024. We accounted for the change in estimated useful lives as a change in estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. The impact of the change in estimate was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2024, resulting in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately 103.0 million 93.3 million after tax, or an increase of 0.86 per diluted share) and 308.5 million 279.2 million after tax, or an increase of 2.58 per diluted share) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. This change in useful lives is expected to reduce depreciation and amortization expense by approximately 411.5 million 372.5 million after tax, or an increase of 3.45 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2024. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This report presents our financial results and other financial metrics on a GAAP basis and, with respect to our international and consolidated results, after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-GAAP measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, as well as by eliminating the impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses on our intercompany loans.

 Revenues Domestic site leasing revenues decreased 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to Sprint lease non-renewals and one-time revenue benefits recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by (1) organic site leasing growth, primarily from monetary lease amendments and additional equipment added to our towers as well as new leases and contractual rent escalators and (2) revenues from 116 towers acquired and 26 towers built since July 1, 2023. International site leasing revenues decreased 8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, international site leasing revenues increased 5.1 million. These changes were primarily due to (1) organic site leasing growth from new leases, amendments, and contractual escalators and (2) revenues from 131 towers acquired and 521 towers built since July 1, 2023, partially offset by lease non-renewals. Site leasing revenue in Brazil represented 14.3 of total site leasing revenue for the period. No other individual international market represented more than 5 of our total site leasing revenue. Site development revenues decreased 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, as a result of decreased carrier activity. Operating Profit Domestic site leasing segment operating profit decreased 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower domestic site leasing revenue as noted above as well as incremental costs associated with towers acquired and built since July 1, 2023. International site leasing segment operating profit decreased 5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, international site leasing segment operating profit increased 3.5 million. These changes were primarily due to higher international site leasing revenues as noted above, partially offset by the incremental costs associated with towers acquired and built since July 1, 2023. Site development segment operating profit decreased 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, as a result of decreased carrier activity .

 Domestic asset impairment and decommission costs decreased 24.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. This change was primarily as a result of decreased impairment charges resulting from our regular analysis of whether the future cash flows from certain towers are adequate to recover the carrying value of the investment in those towers and a decrease in tower and equipment related decommission costs. International asset impairment and decommission costs increased 3.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This report contains information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure. We have provided below a description of Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure. This report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-GAAP measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans. Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground lease expense, non-cash compensation, net loss from extinguishment of debt, other income and expenses, acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and expenses, asset impairment and decommission costs, interest income, interest expenses, depreciation, accretion, and amortization, and income taxes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization, and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement and the indentures relating to the 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.

The decrease was primarily due to increases in cash outflows associated with working capital changes related to the timing of customer payments and cash asset impairment and decommission costs as well as a decrease in site development segment operating profit, partially offset by an increase in site leasing segment operating profit and interest income and a decrease in interest expense. Investing Activities A detail of our cash capital expenditures is as follows: For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Acquisitions of towers and related assets (234,853) (63,411) Land buyouts and other assets (1) (33,556) (29,440) Construction and related costs (96,683) (70,485) Augmentation and tower upgrades (38,485) (62,301) Tower maintenance (33,792) (37,101) General corporate (3,640) (4,089) Other investing activities (2)(3) (39,411) (95,049) Net cash used in investing activities (480,420) (361,876)

Millicom for approximately 975.0 million in cash. These sites are located in Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, with significantly all cash flows denominated in USD. Upon closing,

Millicom will enter into country-specific MLAs to lease back space on all acquired sites for an initial term of 15 years. The MLAs will also incorporate an extension to our approximately 1,500 existing site leases with Millicom for a new 15-year term. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement, we have agreed to a seven-year exclusivity right with Millicom for us to build up to 2,500 build-to-suit sites in Central America for Millicom with new leases on any sites built having an initial lease term of 15 years. This transaction, which is subject to antitrust approvals and other closing conditions, is expected to close some time in 2025. In addition to the Millicom transaction, subsequent to September 30, 2024, we purchased or are under contract to purchase 45 communication sites which are expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2025 at the time of this report for an aggregate consideration of 16.3 million in cash. For 2024, we expect to incur non-discretionary cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate expenditures of 51.0 million to 57.0 million and discretionary cash capital expenditures, based on current or potential acquisition obligations, planned new tower construction, forecasted tower augmentations, and forecasted ground lease purchases, of 490.0 million to 500.0 million. We expect to fund these cash capital expenditures from cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or new financings. The exact amount of our future cash capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio, our new tower build and acquisition programs, and our ground lease purchase program.

The following table illustrates our estimate of our debt service requirement over the next twelve months ended September 30, 2025 based on the amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and the interest rates accruing on those amounts on such date (in thousands): Revolving Credit Facility (1) 12,056 2024 Term Loan (2) 112,892 2014-2C Tower Securities (3) 620,937 2019-1C Tower Securities (4) 1,198,409 2020-1C Tower Securities 14,368 2020-2C Tower Securities 14,159 2021-1C Tower Securities 19,371 2021-2C Tower Securities 16,752 2021-3C Tower Securities 23,491 2022-1C Tower Securities 56,362 2020 Senior Notes 58,125 2021 Senior Notes 46,875 Total debt service for the next 12 months (4) 2,193,797 
 (1) As of September 30, 2024, 160.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we repaid 160.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, and as of the date of this filing, no amount remains outstanding. (2) Total debt service on the 2024 Term Loan (as amended on October 2, 2024) includes the impact of the interest rate swap which swaps 1.95 billion of notional value accruing interest at Term SOFR plus 175 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 1.800 per annum through March 31, 2025 and the forward-starting interest rate swaps, which will swap 2.0 billion of notional value accruing interest at Term SOFR plus 175 basis points for a blended all-in fixed rate of 5.165 per annum beginning March 31, 2025 through April 11, 2028. (3) On October 11, 2024, we repaid the full amount of the 2014-2C Tower Securities with proceeds from the 2024-2C Tower Securities. (4) Our total debt service does not include any amounts for the 2024-1C and 2024-2C Tower Securities. Total debt service for the twelve months ended September 30, 2025 related to the 2024 Tower Securities is projected to be 98.9 million. 1.165 billion of the proceeds from the 2024-1C Tower Securities are being held in escrow, by the Trust, earning interest at the U.S. federal funds rate less 10 basis points until the repayment of the 2019-1C Tower Securities. Inflation The impact of inflation on our operations has not been material to date. However, the impact of rising interest rates, due to actions by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, our growth rate and future operating results. Increasing interest rates has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to incur capital expenditures at prior levels to expand their networks, which could adversely affect our future revenue growth rates. In addition, increased interest rates may adversely affect our costs to refinance our indebtedness at maturity. In addition, persistent high rates of inflation could adversely affect our future operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by long-term contracts with pre-determined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation other than our contracts in South America, South Africa, the Philippines, and Tanzania which have inflationary index based rent escalators.

Our current primary market risk exposure is (1) interest rate risk relating to our ability to refinance our debt at commercially reasonable rates, if at all, and (2) interest rate risk relating to the impact of interest rate movements on the variable portion of our 2024 Term Loan and any borrowings that we may incur under our Revolving Credit Facility, which are at floating rates. We manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our large percentage of fixed rate debt, including interest rate swaps. While we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 1 increase in our variable interest rates as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would have caused our interest expense to increase by approximately 1.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our operations in Brazil, Canada, Chile, Peru, Colombia, South Africa, the Philippines, Tanzania, and to a lesser extent, our markets in Central America. In each of these countries, we pay most of our selling, general, and administrative expenses and a portion of our operating expenses, such as taxes and utilities incurred in the country in local currency. In addition, in Brazil, Canada, Chile, South Africa, and the Philippines, we receive significantly all of our revenue and pay significantly all of our operating expenses in local currency. In Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, and Tanzania, we receive our revenue and pay our operating expenses in a mix of local currency and U.S. dollars. All transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period, and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 21.7 of our revenues and approximately 31.3 of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the Brazilian Real from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would have caused our revenues and operating income to decline by approximately 1.3 and 1.0 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had intercompany debt, which is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As settlement of this debt is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. A change of 10 in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt at September 30, 2024 would have

resulted in approximately 114.8 million of unrealized gains or losses that would have been included in Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
