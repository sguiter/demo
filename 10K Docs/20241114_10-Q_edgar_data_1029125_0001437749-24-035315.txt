Panbela Therapeutics, Inc. 
 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have incurred losses of million since our inception in 2011. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of million. We also incurred negative cash flows from operating activities of approximately million for this period. As we continue to pursue development activities and seek commercialization, we expect to incur substantial losses, which are likely to generate negative net cash flows from operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately , working capital deficit of million (working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities), and stockholders deficit of million. The Company s principal sources of cash have historically included the issuance of debt and equity securities. 

On August 19, 2024, our contract research organization CRO for the ASPIRE trial began the process of terminating our relationship as we were unable to pay invoiced amounts within a satisfactory timeframe. The trial continues and the Company has been working closely with regulatory authorities, the clinical sites, existing and new vendors to ensure that the trial will be completed as intended. As a result of the termination of the contract with this CRO, the Company will be responsible for making payments directly to clinical sites for costs incurred during the conduct of the trial and the Company has now accounted for these estimated costs incurred through September 30, 2024. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability or classification of assets or the amounts of liabilities that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Our current independent registered public accounting firm included a paragraph emphasizing this going concern uncertainty in their audit report regarding our 2023 financial statements dated March 26, 2024. Our ability to continue as a going concern, realize the carrying value of our assets and discharge our liabilities in the ordinary course of business is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to obtain additional financing, the success of our development efforts, our ability to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in the United States, Australia, the European Union or other markets and ultimately our ability to market and sell our product candidates. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue operations as a going concern. See Note 4 titled Liquidity and Business Plan. 

, and (ii) agreed to issue, on or before November 15, 2024, an interest-bearing Senior Convertible Promissory Tranche B Note (the Tranche B Note, and, together with the Tranche A Note, the Nant Capital Notes for the principal sum of , in each case in exchange for a cash purchase price by the Investor to the Company equal to the same principal amounts. A portion of the proceeds of the Tranche A Note were used by the Company to repay certain existing indebtedness, including the USWM Notes Payable and Schemel Note (defined below). The Nant Capital Agreement and Nant Capital Notes are described in more detail in Note 10 titled Subsequent Events. 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 the Company sold subordinated promissory notes to several investors totaling . 

On July 24, 2024, Panbela and its wholly-owned subsidiary, CPP, entered into a Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement with USWM, LLC USWM by executing and delivering to the Lender a Term Promissory Note (the USWM Term Note ). Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, Panbela and CPP obtained a term loan from USWM in the original principal amount of (the USWM Loan ). The Loan Agreement and USWM Term Note are described in more detail in Note 6 titled Notes Payable . 

On January 31, 2024, the Company completed a registered public offering of common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock which resulted in gross proceeds of approximately million. 

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed two registered offerings of common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. On June 21, 2023 and January 31, 2023, the Company completed registered public offerings for gross proceeds of approximately million and million, respectively. 

The Company provided inducement warrants to certain shareholders to exercise their warrants. On November 2, 2023 gross proceeds were approximately million and on December 21, 2023 the gross proceeds were approximately million from these transactions. 

During 2023, the Company also sold shares of common stock via an At the Market (ATM) facility with net proceeds of approximately million. 

We need to raise additional capital to support our current business plans. We may seek to raise additional funds through various sources, such as equity and debt financing, or through strategic collaborations and license agreements. We can give no assurances that we will be able to secure additional sources of funds to support our operations, or if such funds are available to us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs or on terms acceptable to us. This risk would increase if our clinical data were not positive or economic and market conditions deteriorate. 

Our future success is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing, the success of our development efforts, our ability to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates ivospemin, Flynpovi and eflornithine in the United States or other markets and ultimately our ability to market and sell product candidates. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when needed, if our clinical trials are not successful or if we are unable to obtain marketing approval, we would not be able to continue as a going concern and would be forced to cease operations and liquidate our company. 

There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The sale of additional convertible debt or equity securities would likely result in dilution to our current stockholders. 

We charge research and development costs, including clinical trial costs, to expense when incurred. Our human clinical trials are, and will be, performed at clinical trial sites and are administered jointly by us with assistance from CROs. Costs of setting up clinical trial sites are accrued upon execution of the study agreement. Expenses related to the performance of clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts and the achievement of agreed upon milestones, such as patient enrollment, patient follow-up, etc. We monitor levels of performance under each significant contract, including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with the clinical trial sites and CROs, and adjust the estimates, if required, on a quarterly basis so that clinical expenses reflect the actual effort expended at each clinical trial site as reported by each CRO or, in the absence of a CRO, as reported directly by the clinical trial sites. 

The cost to secure certain third-party drug product for the clinical trials, which is often paid for in advance of delivery, is charged to research and development when it is received and available to be shipped to clinical sites. 

All material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice, and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CROs and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. 

In response to the termination of the Clinical Research Services Agreement with the CRO for the ASPIRE trial during the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company is in discussions with the CRO to agree on the final reconciliation of amounts owed and how the existing deposits will be applied against such amounts owed. 

We expense costs associated with obtaining licenses for patented technologies when it is determined there is no alternative future use of the intellectual property subject to the license. 

Common stock issuable under common stock purchase warrants 

, the USWM Loan. The USWM Loan is scheduled to mature on the first to occur of: (i) the closing of a Qualifying Financing (as defined in the USWM Term Note); (ii) the closing of a Qualifying Transaction (as defined in the USWM Term Note) (the Transaction Maturity Date and (iii) December 31, 2024 (as applicable, the Financing Maturity Date ).

The USWM Term Note had an original principal amount of and bears interest and premium as follows: (i) interest and premium in the amount of due and payable on the Financing Maturity Date; plus (ii) interest and premium in an amount equal to ten percent of all proceeds generated by the Company pursuant to a Qualifying Transaction (the Qualifying Transaction Payment ), due and payable on the Transaction Maturity Date, provided, however, that the Qualifying Transaction Payment shall not exceed .

The Company, in anticipation of a potential prepayment of the USWM Term Note, recognized the full interest and premium amount of as interest expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

The USWM Loan proceeds could only be used by the Company for payment of fees and expenses owed to its CRO for the ASPIRE trial, for other working capital purposes, and to pay any fees or expenses in connection with the USWM Loan. To secure their obligations under the Loan Agreement and USWM Term Note, Panbela and CPP entered into a Security Agreement in favor of the USWM whereby each granted to USWM a first priority security interest in all of Panbela s and CPP s rights, title and interest in the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated July 17, 2023, by and among USWM, Panbela, and CPP. 

On October 25, 2024, the Company completed a Qualifying Financing when it received funds totaling pursuant to the sale of Tranche A Note. See Note 10 titled Subsequent Events .

Overview 

Panbela Therapeutics, Inc. Panbela and together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, we, us, our, and the Company is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing disruptive therapeutics for the treatment of patients with urgent unmet medical needs. 

The Company s lead assets are ivospemin (SBP-101), Flynpovi TM (eflornithine (CPP-1X) and sulindac), and eflornithine (CPP-1X), which provide a multi-targeted approach to reset dysregulated biology present in many types of diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity. Many tumors require greatly elevated levels of polyamines to support their growth and survival. These agents target the polyamine pathway at complementary junctions, which have been shown to be altered in disease. In particular, our lead assets have the potential to suppress and prevent tumor growth, enhance anti-tumor activity of other anti-cancer agents, and modulate the immune system. 

The Company has exclusively licensed the worldwide rights to ivospemin from the University of Florida Research Foundation, Inc. The Company also has an exclusive worldwide license to commercialize Flynpovi from the Arizona Board of Regents of the University of Arizona. 

As Panbela is focused on utilizing a polyamine platform to develop disruptive therapeutics for the treatment of patients with urgent unmet medical needs, we are engaged in two sponsored research agreements to evaluate the polyamines individually and combined for various diseases. At present, the collaboration with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine has been focused on mechanism of action and solid tumors while the MD Anderson Cancer Center has been focused on the hematologic malignancies. 

Ivospemin (SBP-101) 

In 2015, the FDA accepted our Investigational New Drug IND application for our ivospemin product candidate. In May of 2022 we were notified that the United States Adopted Names USAN had adopted ivospemin as a USAN for SBP-101. The USAN information on ivospemin was posted on the USAN Web site (www.ama-assn.org/go/usan). 

17

We have completed an initial clinical trial of ivospemin in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. This was a Phase I, first-in-human, dose-escalation, safety study. From January 2016 through September 2017, we enrolled twenty-nine patients into six cohorts, or groups, in the dose-escalation phase of the Phase I trial. No drug-related bone marrow toxicity or peripheral neuropathy was observed at any dose level. In addition to being evaluated for safety, 23 of the 29 patients were evaluable for preliminary signals of efficacy prior to or at the eight-week conclusion of their first cycle of treatment using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST ), the currently accepted standard for evaluating change in the size of tumors. 

In 2018, we began enrolling patients in our second clinical trial, a Phase Ia/Ib study of the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ivospemin administered in combination with two standard-of-care chemotherapy agents, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in four cohorts to evaluate the dosage level and schedule. An additional 25 subjects were enrolled in the expansion phase of the trial. Interim results were presented in January of 2022. Best response in evaluable subjects (cohorts 4 and Ib N=29) was a CR in 1 (3 ), PR in 13 (45 ), SD in 10 (34 and PD in 5 (17 . One subject did not have post baseline scans with RECIST tumor assessments. Median PFS, now final at 6.5 months, may have been negatively impacted by drug dosing interruptions to evaluate potential toxicity. Median overall survival in cohort 4 + Phase Ib was 12.0 months when data was presented in January 2022 and is now final at 14.6 months. Two patients from cohort 2 have demonstrated long term survival; one at 30.3 months (final data) and one at 33.0 months. Both such patients were still alive at database lock on March 18, 2022. Six additional subjects from cohort 4 and Phase Ib are still alive at database lock. 

In January of 2022, the Company announced the initiation of a new clinical trial. Referred to as ASPIRE, the trial is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, a standard pancreatic cancer treatment regimen in patients previously untreated for metastatic pancreatic cancer. The trial will be conducted globally at approximately 94 sites in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. The Company announced the first patient enrolled in the trial in Australia in August of 2022. In September 2022, the Company announced that they had obtained regulatory approval to open sites in Spain, France and Italy. On September 30, 2024, there were 89 sites open in 10 countries. 

The trial was originally designed as a Phase II/III with a smaller initial sample size. In response to European and FDA regulatory feedback, the study was amended to include the total trial sample size (600) and the design was modified to utilize overall survival (the primary endpoint) to be examined at interim analysis as well. All countries are open, and the full complement of sites are also open as of September 30, 2024. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has met three times for a prespecified safety analysis, most recently in June 2024, and recommended the trial continue without modification. On January 25, 2024, the Company announced that the trial had exceeded 50 enrollment and projects that full enrollment will be completed by the first quarter of 2025. The interim data analysis based on overall survival was originally projected to be available by the middle of 2024. The Company announced on April 22, 2024 that the interim analysis is now expected in the first quarter of 2025, as the patients are living longer than expected which may suggest a survival benefit. 

On August 19, 2024, our contract research organization CRO for the ASPIRE trial began the process of terminating our relationship as we were unable to pay the balance due within a satisfactory timeframe. The trial continues and the Company has been working closely with regulatory authorities, the clinical sites, existing and new vendors to ensure that the trial will be completed as intended. With the transition, enrollment is now anticipated to be complete by Q2 2025. The interim analysis is still expected in early 2025. 

In early April 2024, the Company announced a poster presentation highlighting the results for ivospemin as a polyamine metabolism modulator in ovarian cancer at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Conference. The poster concludes that the treatment of C57Bl/6 mice containing VDID8 + ovarian cancer with SBP-101 in combination with doxorubicin significantly prolonged survival and decreased overall tumor burden. The results suggest that SBP-101 in combination with doxorubicin may have a role in the clinical management of ovarian cancer, in particular the difficult to treat platinum-resistant population where few options exist, and the Company intends to continue pre-clinical and clinical studies in ovarian cancer. 

Additional clinical trials may be required for FDA or other country approvals. The cost and timing of additional clinical trials are highly dependent on the nature and size of the trials.

Flynpovi (eflornithine (CPP-1X) and sulindac) 

In 2009, the FDA accepted our IND application for the combination product, Flynpovi, product candidate. 

In a Phase III study, the efficacy and safety of the combination of eflornithine and sulindac known as Flynpovi, as compared with either drug eflornithine or sulindac alone, in adults with familial adenomatous polyposis FAP was conducted. A total of 171 patients underwent randomization. Disease progression occurred in 18 of 56 patients (32 in the Flynpovi group, 22 of 58 (38 in the sulindac group, and 23 of 57 (40 in the eflornithine group, with a hazard ratio of 0.71 (95 confidence interval CI ), 0.39 to 1.32) for Flynpovi as compared with sulindac p = 0.29) and 0.66 (95 CI, 0.36 to 1.23) for Flynpovi as compared with eflornithine. In a post-hoc analysis, none of the patients in the Flynpovi arm progressed to a need for lower gastrointestinal LGI surgery for up to 48 months compared with 7 (13.2 and 8 (15.7 patients in the sulindac and eflornithine (CPP-1X) arms. These data corresponded to risk reductions for the need for LGI surgery approaching 100 between Flynpovi and either monotherapy with HR = 0.00 (95 CI, 0.00 0.48; p = 0.005) for Flynpovi versus sulindac and HR = 0.00 (95 CI, 0.00 0.44; p = 0.003) for Flynpovi versus eflornithine. Given the statistical significance of the LGI group, a new drug application NDA was filed with the FDA. As the study failed to meet the primary endpoint, and the NDA was based on the results of an exploratory analysis, a complete response letter was issued. To address this deficiency concern, the Company must submit the results of one or more adequate and well-controlled clinical trials which demonstrate an effect on a clinical endpoint. 

In April of 2023, the Company regained the North American rights to develop and commercialize Flynpovi in patients with FAP, as a result of the termination of the licensing agreement between CPP and One-Two Therapeutics Assets Limited. The Company plans to seek FDA and EMA guidance on a registration path with a focus on the LGI patient population. 

We also have an ongoing double-blind placebo-controlled trial of Flynpovi to prevent recurrence of high-risk adenomas and second primary colorectal cancers in patients with stage 0-III colon or rectal cancer, Phase III Preventing Adenomas of the Colon with Eflornithine and Sulindac PACES ). The purpose of this study is to assess whether the combination of eflornithine and sulindac (compared to corresponding placebos) has efficacy against colorectal lesions with respect to high-grade dysplasia, adenomas with villous features, adenomas one cm or greater, multiple adenomas, any adenomas >/= 0.3 cm, total advanced colorectal events, or total colorectal events. The PACES trial is funded by the National Cancer Institute NCI in collaboration with Southwest Oncology Group SWOG ). The Company announced on June 28, 2023 that the PACES trial passed a pre-planned futility analysis. 

Eflornithine (CPP-1X)/eflornithine sachets (CPP-1X-S) 

In 2009 and 2018, the FDA accepted our IND applications for eflornithine. 

There is a trial evaluating eflornithine sachets in STK11 mutation patients with non-small cell lung cancer that is open and recruiting patients and we hope to have the first patient enrolled in the first half of this year. For eflornithine tablets, a Phase II trial in early onset Type I diabetes was opened on January 11, 2023 in collaboration with Indiana University and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation JDRF ). Two poster presentations were given discussing the Phase I Type One Diabetes T1D results, one at the Endocrine Society meeting and the other at the Immunology of Diabetes Society Meeting in June 2023. Additionally, eflornithine is being evaluated with high dose testosterone and enzalutamide in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in a phase II trial. 

On June 10, 2024, the Company announced the Oral Presentation at Digestive Disease Week (DDW): Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Eflornithine (Difluoromethylornithine, DFMO) in Patients with Gastric Premalignant Conditions in the High Incidence Areas of Latin America. The results of the study demonstrated that eflornithine reduced DNA damage long-term in patients after completing treatment, as measured by pH2AX immunostaining, a DNA damage marker was significantly lower at the 24 month vs. 18-month time point in the eflornithine group and unchanged in the placebo group. 

19

On July 17, 2023, the Company divested certain rights, titles and interests in its eflornithine pediatric neuroblastoma program. Included in these assets is an ongoing trial evaluating eflornithine sachets in relapsed refractory neuroblastoma supported by the Children s Oncology Group COG /NCI. Under the terms of the agreement with US World Meds , the Company is entitled to receive up to approximately 9.5 million in non-dilutive funding in exchange for the sale of these assets. An initial payment of 400,000 was received by the Company at the time of closing, remaining payments will be receivable if the acquiring company successfully completes certain milestones related to clinical development, regulatory approval and commercial sales. In April 2024, an additional upfront payment of 0.8 million was made to the Company in exchange for an amendment which reduced certain future milestones. After this amendment the Company is now entitled to receive up to approximately 7.6 million in addition to the funding already received. 

Financial Overview 

On January 18, 2024, we effected a reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-twenty (1:20) shares of the Company s common stock. On June 1, 2023, we effected a reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-forty (1:30) shares of the Company s common stock and on January 13, 2023, we effected a reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-forty (1:40) shares of the Company s common stock. All share and per share amounts of our common stock presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect these reverse stock splits. 

On March 5, 2024, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notified us that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had determined to delist our common stock and trading of our common stock was suspended on Nasdaq effective March 7, 2024. On April 17, 2024, our common stock became eligible for quotation on OTCQB. Also in April 2024, Nasdaq filed a Form 25 Notification of Removal from Listing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and the delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq became effective ten days later. 

We have incurred losses of 146.9 million since 2011. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 21.4 million. We also incurred negative cash flows from operating activities of approximately 12.5 million for this period. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses, which will generate negative net cash flows from operating activities, as we continue to pursue research and development activities and commercialize. 

Our cash was approximately 0.1 million and 2.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. A decrease of 2.5 million in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to 12.5 million negative cash flow from operations offset in part by 0.8 million of net investing activities and 9.3 million of net financing activities. Cash used in operations was significantly reduced during the second and third quarter as the Company s current liabilities were increased. Net financing activities included a registered public offering of common stock, pre-funded warrants, and warrants, with net proceeds of approximately 8.1 million, and the sale of promissory notes totaling 2.2 million. In the same period, the Company also recorded 1.0 million in loan repayments. 

We need to raise additional capital immediately to continue our operations and execute our business plan, including completing required future trials and pursuing regulatory approvals in the United States, the European Union, and other international markets. Historically we have financed our operations principally from the sale of equity securities and debt. While we have been successful in the past in obtaining the necessary capital to support our operations and we are likely to seek additional financing through similar means, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing under commercially reasonable terms and conditions, or at all. This risk would increase if our clinical data were not positive or if economic or market conditions deteriorate. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we would need to take further actions to scale back our operations, taking actions which may include, among other things, reducing use of outside professional service providers, reducing staff or staff compensation, significantly modifying, or delaying the development of our product candidates, licensing to third parties the rights to commercialize our product candidates, or ceasing operations. 

At a special meeting of stockholders held on May 28, 2024, we obtained approval from our stockholders proposed amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock at a reverse stock split ratio ranging from any whole number between 1-for-10 and 1-for-45, subject to and as determined by our Board of Directors. The primary reason we sought stockholder approval of the reverse stock split is to attempt to increase the per share market price of our common stock to exceed the minimum closing bid price of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has approved a reverse stock split ratio of 1-for-45, to be applied if and when the pending reverse stock split is effected.

Our G A expenses were flat to year ago at 1.1 million in the third quarter of 2024. 

21

Research and development expense 

Our R D expenses decreased 10.2 to 6.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 down from 6.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a small decrease in activity by our ASPIRE CRO associated with the transition and reduced preclinical research. 

Other income (expense), net 

Other expense, net, was approximately 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Other income for this period includes 0.8 million from the gain on sale of intellectual property and 0.2 million foreign currency exchange gain on the intercompany receivable balance. This income was reduced by interest expense on one promissory note. 

Other expense, net, was approximately 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense in the three months ended September 30, 2023, is related to interest expense offset by foreign currency exchange gain on the intercompany receivable balance. 

Income tax benefit 

No income tax benefit was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 which is down from 19,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our income tax benefit is derived primarily from refundable tax credits associated with our R D activities conducted in Australia. The ASPIRE trial is being conducted in several countries across the world, including four clinical sites in Australia as of September 30, 2024. Costs incurred to do research in Australia are available for this refundable credit. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

General and administrative expense 

Our G A expenses decreased 16.6 to 3.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 down from 4.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is due primarily to reduced legal and other professional services. 

Research and development expense 

Our R D expenses increased 28.1 to 18.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 up from 14.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. R D expenses increased 4.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 due to increased sites and subject enrollments in the ASPIRE trial. The ASPIRE trial will continue to drive increased costs versus the prior year as the enrollment continues to increase. 

Other income (expense), net 

Other income, net, was approximately 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Other income for this period is related to the gain on sale of intellectual property and a foreign currency exchange gain on the intercompany receivable balance partial offset by interest expense on the Company s debt. 

Other expense, net, was approximately 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was related to foreign currency exchange loss on the intercompany receivable balance and interest expense on two promissory notes.

Working Capital 

Our total cash and cash equivalents were 0.1 million and 2.6 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. We had 20.1 million in current liabilities and a working capital deficit of 19.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 12.3 million in current liabilities and working capital deficit of 9.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. 

Cash Flows 

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 12.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 22.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash used in each of these periods primarily reflects the net loss for these periods and is adjusted by the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in current liabilities amounted to an approximate 4.9 million favorable adjustment to cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in CRO deposits as the result of the termination of our contract with our CRO (a portion of the CRO deposit was used to offset the balance owed to the CRO) had a 4.5 million favorable impact on cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 21.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash provided for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents the 8.1 million proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants and 2.2 million from the sale of promissory notes, partially offset by the 1.0 million payment made on one promissory note. The cash provided for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 represents the 23.1 million proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants, partially offset by the 1.7 million payment and payoff of promissory notes. 

Capital Requirements 

As we continue to pursue our operations and execute our business plan, including the completion of the clinical development plan for our initial product candidate, ivospemin, in pancreatic cancer, and pursuing regulatory approvals in the United States, the European Union and other international markets, we expect to continue to incur substantial and increasing losses, which will continue to generate negative net cash flows from operating activities. 

Our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous current and future factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 

the progress of clinical trials required to support our applications for regulatory approvals, including the completion of our global, randomized registration trial (ASPIRE) initiated in January of 2022; 

the cost to implement development efforts for ivospemin in ovarian cancer and expand development efforts for assets acquired as the result of the acquisition of CPP; 

the cost, if any, to develop our product candidate, Flynpovi; 

the cost to develop eflornithine in various indications if early clinical trials underway now, and funded through third party collaborations, are successful; 

our ability to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates; 

our ability to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates in the United States, the European Union or other international markets; 

the cost and delays in product development that may result from changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our product candidates; 

the market acceptance and level of future sales of our product candidates; 

the rate of progress in establishing reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors; 

the effect of competing technological and market developments; and 

the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims. 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any existing credit facilities under which we could borrow funds. Historically we have financed our operations principally from the sale of equity securities and debt. While we have been successful in the past in obtaining the necessary capital to support our operations and we are likely to seek additional financing through similar means, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing under commercially reasonable terms and conditions, or at all.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The accounting estimates used in preparing our interim fiscal 2024 condensed consolidated financial statements are the same as those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 3. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide disclosure pursuant to this item. 

Item 4. 

Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. As of the date of this filing, management has not identified any material weaknesses. We believe that our internal control system provides reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Therefore, even effective internal controls over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time. 

26

As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, the Company s management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information relating to the Company required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We have not identified any change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 

Legal Proceedings. 

None. 

Item 1A. 

Risk Factors. 

In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Form 10-K ), which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. 

There have been no material changes in the risk factors disclosed in the Form 10-K, except the following risk associated with our common stock has been updated as follows: 

Failure to obtain or maintain a listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange could seriously harm the liquidity of our stock and our ability to raise capital. 

Nasdaq completed the delisting of our common stock by filing a Form 25 Notification of Delisting with the SEC on April 24, 2024. Our common stock became eligible for quotation on the OTCQB market starting on April 16, 2024, under the symbol PBLA. We have applied to relist our common stock on the Nasdaq. No assurances can be given that we will satisfy the listing criteria, our application will be approved, or that a trading market will develop or be maintained. Our share price on the OTCQB may not be indicative of the market price on Nasdaq if we become listed. 

If, for any reason, we were unable to obtain listing on Nasdaq or another reputable national securities exchange, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each of which could materially adversely affect our stockholders: 

the liquidity and marketability of our common stock; 

the market price of our common stock; 

our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations; 

27

the number of institutional and general investors that will consider investing in our common stock; 

the number of market makers in our common stock; 

the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock; and 

the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock. 

In addition, if we cannot obtain or maintain a listing on a national securities exchange, we may have to continue trading on a less recognized or accepted market, such as the OTCQB, our stock would continue to be traded as a penny stock , which would make transactions in our stock more difficult and cumbersome, and we may be unable to access capital on favorable terms or at all, as companies trading on alternative markets may be viewed as less attractive investments with higher associated risks, such that existing or prospective institutional investors may be less interested in, or prohibited from, investing in our common stock. This may also cause the market price of our common stock to decline further. 

The protection provided by the federal securities laws relating to forward-looking statements may not apply to us. The lack of this protection could harm us in the event of an adverse outcome in a legal proceeding relating to forward-looking statements made by us. 

Although federal securities laws provide a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by a public company that files reports under the federal securities laws, this safe harbor is not available to certain issuers, including penny stock issuers. If we are determined to have issued a penny stock, we will not have the benefit of this statutory safe harbor protection in the event of certain legal actions based upon forward-looking statements. The lack of this protection in a contested proceeding could harm our financial condition and, ultimately, the value of our common stock. 

Our common stock is eligible for quotation on the over-the-counter-market but not listed on any national securities exchange. 

Our shares of common stock are eligible for quotation on the OTCQB tier of the over-the-counter markets. Despite eligibility for quotation, no assurance can be given that any market for our common stock will be maintained for any period of time. Quotation on the over-the-counter markets is generally understood to be a less active, and therefore less liquid, trading market than other types of markets such as a national securities exchange. In comparison to a listing on a national securities exchange, quotation on the over-the-counter markets is expected to have an adverse effect on the liquidity of shares of our common stock, both in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in analyst and media coverage. This may result in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and ask prices for our common stock. 

Due to our reliance on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are unable to directly control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials, which could adversely affect our clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals. 

We rely on independent third-party CROs to conduct many of our clinical trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, program management and bio-analytical analysis. Many important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are out of our direct control. Due to recent cash constraints, we have been unable to stay current with payments to the CRO for the ASPIRE trial. In May 2024, we were notified by the CRO of their intent to terminate their relationship with us if we were unable to pay the balances due in a satisfactory timeframe. In exchange for a 1.5 million payment made on July 26, 2024, our CRO for the ASPIRE trial has provided an extension of their intent to terminate our relationship to August 19, 2024. The payment to that CRO was funded by proceeds from the USWM Loan. On August 19, 2024, the CRO began termination our contract with them, and the Company at that time assumed direct responsibility for the conduct of the trial. The Company is also in contract negotiation with a new CRO to assist with the completion of the study. The termination of the contract with the previous CRO and the associated transfer of all aspects of the trial, either directly to the Company or a new CRO, is expected to cause the completion of the ASPIRE trial to be delayed.

Junior Lender will not contest the enforceability, perfection or priority of Lender s now or in the future existing security interests and other liens, assignments, pledges, and other rights and interests granted in, arising out of, or with respect to, any of the Lender Collateral, or the validity, enforceability, or amount of the Debt. Each holder of Debt, either now existing or hereafter arising, shall be deemed to have acquired such Debt in reliance upon the provisions contained in this Agreement.

In the event Lender, in its sole discretion, undertakes, at any time or from time to time, to provide any such information to Junior Lender, Lender shall be under no obligation to undertake any investigation and shall be under no obligation to disclose any information which Lender wishes to maintain confidential.

To the extent of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Subordinated Note, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern. Any default by Junior Lender or any Obligor in the performance of its respective obligations under this Agreement or the Acknowledgment attached hereto shall constitute an event of default under all of the loan agreements between Borrower and Lender.
