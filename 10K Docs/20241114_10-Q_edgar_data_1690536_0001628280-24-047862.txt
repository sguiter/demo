of its Class T, Class S, Class D, Class M and Class I shares of common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"SEC"), consisting of up to in shares in its primary offering and up to in shares pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan. The Company is also conducting a private offering of its Class I common stock to certain accredited investors. 
 The Company has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2017. The Company intends to be an investment vehicle of indefinite duration focused on real estate debt investments and other real estate-related assets. The shares of common stock are generally intended to be sold and repurchased by the Company on a continuous basis. The Company intends to conduct its operations so that it is not required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). 
 The Company s primary investment objectives are to: provide current income in the form of regular, stable cash distributions to achieve an attractive dividend yield; preserve and protect invested capital; realize appreciation in net asset value ("NAV") from proactive investment management and asset management; and provide an investment alternative for stockholders seeking to allocate a portion of their long-term investment portfolios to commercial real estate debt with lower volatility than public real estate companies.

 Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due to it pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is determined to be impaired, the Company assigns the loan a risk rating of 5 and records the impairment as a specific CECL reserve. For determining a specific CECL reserve, financial instruments are assessed outside of the CECL model on an individual basis. For collateral dependent loans that the Company determines foreclosure of the collateral is probable, the Company assigns the loan a risk rating of 5 and measures the expected losses based on the differences between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. For these loans, the allowance for expected credit losses may be zero if the fair value of the collateral on the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of the loan. For collateral dependent loans where the Company determine foreclosure is not probable, a practical expedient to estimate expected losses is applied using the difference between the collateral s fair value (less costs to sell the asset if repayment is expected through the sale of the collateral) and the amortized cost basis of the loan. These valuations require significant judgments, which include assumptions regarding capitalization rates, leasing, creditworthiness of major tenants, occupancy rates, availability of financing, exit plan, loan sponsorship, actions of other lenders, and other factors deemed necessary by FS Real Estate Advisor and Rialto. Actual losses, if any, could ultimately differ from these estimates. 
 Separate provisions of ASC Topic 326 apply to the Mortgage-backed securities available-for-sale, which are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company is required to establish an initial credit loss allowance for those available-for-sale securities that are purchased with credit deterioration PCD by grossing up the amortized cost basis of each security and providing an offsetting credit loss allowance for the difference between expected cash flows and contractual cash flows, both on a present value basis. As of the January 1, 2023 effective date, no such credit loss allowance gross-up was required on available-for-sale debt securities with PCD. 
 The Company uses a discounted cash flow method to estimate and recognize a credit loss allowance on its available-for-sale securities. The credit loss allowance represents the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and the present value of expected cash flows. The credit loss allowance is limited to the difference between the security's fair value and its amortized cost. Changes in the credit loss allowance are recognized immediately in earnings as a component of Credit loss expense, net.

 Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

 property acquisition to date was acquired in 2022 and was accounted for as an asset acquisition. 
 Upon the acquisition of a property, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above-market and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The Company assesses and considers fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that it deems appropriate, as well as other available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on several factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends and market and economic conditions. The Company capitalizes acquisition-related costs associated with asset acquisitions. 
 The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The Company records acquired in-place lease values based on the Company s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. The Company will record acquired above-market and below-market leases at their fair values which represents the present value of the difference between contractual rents of acquired leases and market rents at the time of the acquisition for the remaining lease term, discounted for tenant credit risks. The Company also considers an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on its acquisition to date, the Company s allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has not been material. 
 Intangible assets and intangible liabilities are recorded as a component of other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The amortization of acquired above-market, below-market, and in-place leases is recorded as a component of depreciation and amortization, on the Company s unaudited consolidated statements of operations. 
 The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of the Company s properties and any acquisition-related costs, along with any subsequent improvements to such properties.

 The Company receives foreclosed properties in settlement of loans held for investment by taking legal title or physical possession of the properties. Foreclosed properties are generally recognized at the time the real estate is received at foreclosure sale or upon execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Foreclosed properties are initially measured at fair value. If the fair value of the property is lower than the carrying value of the loan, the difference is recognized within Credit loss expense and the cumulative reserve on the loan is charged off. A gain may be recognized if the fair value of the property exceeds the carrying value of the loan. 
 The Company s management reviews its real estate properties for impairment each quarter or when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impaired value. Since the impairment model considers real estate properties to be long-lived assets to be held and used, cash flows to determine whether an asset has been impaired are undiscounted. Accordingly, the Company s strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If the Company s strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material to the Company s results. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. During the periods presented, no such impairment occurred. 
 The Company reviews its real estate assets, from time to time, in order to determine whether to sell such assets. Real estate assets are classified as held for sale when the Company commits to a plan to sell the asset, when the asset is being actively marketed for sale

 Current Expected Credit Loss Reserve 
 The CECL reserve required under GAAP reflects the Company's current estimate of potential credit losses related to the loans included in its consolidated balance sheets. The general CECL reserve is measured on a collective basis wherever similar risk characteristics exist within a pool of similar assets. The Company has identified senior loans and mezzanine loans as pools within its loans receivable portfolio. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of the Company's CECL reserve.

 The dealer manager for the Company s continuous public offering is FS Investment Solutions, LLC, or FS Investment Solutions, which is an affiliate of FS Real Estate Advisor. Under the amended and restated dealer manager agreement dated as of August 17, 2018, or the dealer manager agreement, FS Investment Solutions is entitled to receive upfront selling commissions of up to , and upfront dealer manager fees of of the transaction price of each Class T share sold in the primary offering, however such amounts may vary at certain participating broker-dealers provided that the sum will not exceed of the transaction price (subject to reductions for certain categories of purchasers). FS Investment Solutions is entitled to receive upfront selling commissions of up to of the transaction price per Class S share sold in the primary offering (subject to reductions for certain categories of purchasers). The dealer manager anticipates that all of the selling commissions and dealer manager fees will be re-allowed to participating broker-dealers, unless a particular broker-dealer declines to accept some portion of the dealer manager fee they are otherwise eligible to receive. Pursuant to the dealer manager agreement, the Company also reimburses FS Investment Solutions or participating broker-dealers for bona fide due diligence expenses, provided that total organization and offering expenses shall not exceed of the gross proceeds in the Company's public offering.

 per annum; however, with respect to Class T shares sold through certain participating broker-dealers, the advisor stockholder servicing fee and the dealer stockholder servicing fee may be other amounts, provided that the sum of such fees will always equal per annum of the NAV of such shares; 
 with respect to the Company's outstanding Class S shares equal to per annum of the aggregate NAV of its outstanding Class S shares; 
 with respect to the Company's outstanding Class D shares equal to per annum of the aggregate NAV of its outstanding Class D shares; and 
 with respect to the Company's outstanding Class M shares equal to per annum of the aggregate NAV of its outstanding Class M shares. 
 The Company does not pay a stockholder servicing fee with respect to its Class I, Class F or Class Y shares. The dealer manager reallows some or all of the stockholder servicing fees to participating broker-dealers, servicing broker-dealers and financial institutions (including bank trust departments) for ongoing stockholder services performed by such broker-dealers, and waives (pays back to the Company) stockholder servicing fees to the extent a broker-dealer or financial institution is not eligible or otherwise declines to receive all or a portion of such fees.

These amounts are referred to as the sales charge cap. At the end of such month that the sales charge cap is reached, each Class D, Class M, Class S or Class T share in such account will convert into a number of Class I shares (including any fractional shares) with an equivalent aggregate NAV as such share. 
 In addition, the Company will cease paying stockholder servicing fees on each Class D share, Class M share, Class S share and Class T share held in a stockholder s account and each such share will convert to Class I shares on the earlier to occur of the following: (i) a listing of Class I shares on a national securities exchange; (ii) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s assets or the Company s merger or consolidation with or into another entity in a transaction in which holders of Class D, Class M, Class S or Class T shares receive cash and/or shares of stock that are listed on a national securities exchange; or (iii) the date following the completion of the Company s public offering on which, in the aggregate, underwriting compensation from all sources in connection with the Company s public offering, including selling commissions, dealer manager fees, stockholder servicing fees and other underwriting compensation, is equal to of the gross proceeds from its primary offering. 
 The Company accrues future stockholder servicing fees in an amount equal to its best estimate of fees payable to FS Investment Solutions at the time such shares are sold. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company accrued and , respectively, of stockholder servicing fees payable to FS Investment Solutions. FS Investment Solutions has entered into agreements with selected dealers distributing the Company's shares in the public offering, which provide, among other things, for the re-allowance of the full amount of the selling commissions and dealer manager fee and all or a portion of the stockholder servicing fees received by FS Investment Solutions to such selected dealers. 
 FS Investment Solutions also serves or served as the placement agent for the Company s private offerings of Class I, Class F and Class Y shares pursuant to placement agreements. FS Investment Solutions does not receive any compensation pursuant to these agreements.

The Company will repay FS Real Estate Advisor or Rialto on a quarterly basis any ordinary operating expenses previously waived or paid, but only if the reimbursement would not cause the then-current expense limitation, if any, to be exceeded. In addition, the reimbursement of expenses will be made only if payable not more than from the end of the fiscal quarter in which the expenses were paid or waived.

 (1) Stockholder servicing fees only apply to Class T, Class S, Class D and Class M shares. Under GAAP, the Company accrues future stockholder servicing fees in an amount equal to its best estimate of fees payable to FS Investment Solutions at the time such shares are sold. For purposes of NAV, the Company recognizes the stockholder servicing fee as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis. As a result, the estimated liability for the future stockholder servicing fees, which are accrued at the time each share is sold, will have no effect on the NAV of any class. 
 Share Repurchase Plan 
 The Company has adopted an amended and restated share repurchase plan, or share repurchase plan, whereby on a monthly basis, stockholders may request that the Company repurchase all or any portion of their shares. The repurchase of shares is limited to no more than of the Company's aggregate NAV per month of all classes of shares then participating in the share repurchase plan and no more than of the Company's aggregate NAV per calendar quarter of all classes of shares then participating in the share repurchase plan, which means that in any 12-month period, the Company limits repurchases to approximately of the total NAV

In August 2024 and September 2024, the Company received repurchase requests equal to and , respectively, of its aggregate NAV of all classes of shares then participating in its share repurchase plan as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar month. Further, the cumulative repurchase requests for the third quarter of 2024 equaled of the Company's aggregate NAV of all classes of shares then participating in its share repurchase plan as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar quarter. The Company's board of directors, including all of its independent directors, unanimously authorized repurchases in excess of its monthly repurchase limitation for August 2024 and September 2024 and its quarterly repurchase limitation for the third quarter of 2024 such that of share repurchase requests timely received in August 2024 and September 2024 and the third quarter of 2024 were satisfied. The Company had no unfulfilled repurchase requests during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, respectively. 
 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 Pursuant to the Company's distribution reinvestment plan, holders of shares of any class of the Company's common stock may elect to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of the Company's common stock. The purchase price for shares pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan will be equal to the transaction price for such shares at the time the distribution is payable. 
 Distributions 
 The Company generally intends to distribute substantially all of its taxable income, which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP , to its stockholders each year to comply with the REIT provisions of the Code. Dividends are paid first to the holders of the Company's Series A preferred stock at the rate of per annum plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, and then to the holders of the Company's common stock. All distributions will be made at the discretion of the Company's board of directors and will depend upon its taxable income, financial condition, maintenance of REIT status, applicable law, and other factors that the Company's board of directors deems relevant.

 CMBS, Fair Value Option 
 As discussed in the Fair Value of Financial Instruments section of Note 2 herein, the Company elected the fair value option for 
 certain CMBS mortgage loans in an effort to eliminate an accounting mismatch resulting from consolidation of the related mortgage loans held in securitization trusts. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value and unpaid principal balance of these CMBS, excluding the notional value of interest-only securities and before consolidation of the securitization mortgage loans, were and , respectively. As a result of the consolidation of the mortgage loans, the total fair value balance of represents the Company's economic interest in the asset. The vast majority of this fair value (all except at September 30, 2024) is eliminated in consolidation of the related mortgage obligations before arriving at the GAAP balance for the fair value option investment securities.

 Loans receivable, held-for-investment Interest receivable Other assets Mortgage loans held in securitization trusts, at fair value Total assets Liabilities Collateralized loan obligations, net Interest payable Other liabilities Mortgage obligations issued by securitization trusts, at fair value Total liabilities 
 The Company has financed a portion of its loans through CLOs, which are considered VIEs. The Company has a controlling financial interest in the CLOs and, therefore, consolidates them on its balance sheets because the Company has both (i) the power to direct activities of the CLOs that most significantly affect the CLOs' economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits of the CLOs that could potentially be significant to the CLOs. 
 Assets held by the CLOs are restricted and can be used only to settle obligations of the CLOs. The liabilities are non-recourse to the Company and can only be satisfied from the assets of the CLOs. 
 Investment Securities 
 Mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts consolidated in accordance with ASC 810 are structured as pass through entities that receive principal and interest on the underlying collateral and distribute those payments to the certificate holders. The assets and other instruments held by these securitization entities are restricted and can only be used to fulfill the obligations of the entity. Additionally, the obligations of the securitization entities do not have any recourse to the general credit of any other consolidated entities, nor to the Company as the primary beneficiary. The mortgage obligations initially represent investment securities on the balance sheet (pre-consolidation). Upon consolidation of the mortgage loans and obligations, the associated investment securities are eliminated, as is the interest income related to those securities. 
 The inclusion of the assets and liabilities of the mortgage loans and obligations in which the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary has no economic effect on the Company. Its exposure to the obligations of mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization is generally limited to its investment in these entities. The Company is not obligated to provide, nor has provided, any financial support for any of these consolidated structures. 
 Non-Consolidated Variable Interest Entities 
 The Company invested in subordinated positions of CMBS trusts which are considered mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of the mortgage loans and obligations because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the mortgage loans and obligations' economic performance, nor does it provide guarantees or recourse to the mortgage loans and obligations other than standard representations and warranties and, therefore, does not consolidate the mortgage loans and obligations on its balance sheets. The Company has classified its investment in the CMBS as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale debt securities that are included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and are

 Introduction 
 We were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on November 7, 2016 and formally commenced investment operations on September 13, 2017. We are managed by FS Real Estate Advisor pursuant to an advisory agreement between us and FS Real Estate Advisor. FS Real Estate Advisor is a subsidiary of our sponsor, FS Investments, a national sponsor of alternative investment funds designed for the individual investor. FS Real Estate Advisor has engaged Rialto to act as its sub-adviser. We are currently conducting a public offering of up to 2,750,000 of our Class T, Class S, Class D, Class M and Class I shares of common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 filed with the SEC consisting of up to 2,500,000 in shares in our primary offering and up to 250,000 in shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. We are also conducting a private offering of our Class I common stock to certain accredited investors. 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017. We intend to be an investment vehicle of indefinite duration focused on real estate debt investments and other real estate-related assets. The shares of common stock are generally intended to be sold and repurchased by us on a continuous basis. We intend to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register under the 1940 Act. 
 Our primary investment objectives are to: provide current income in the form of regular, stable cash distributions to achieve an attractive dividend yield; preserve and protect invested capital; realize appreciation in NAV from proactive management and asset management; and provide an investment alternative for stockholders seeking to allocate a portion of their long-term investment portfolios to commercial real estate debt with lower volatility than public real estate companies. 
 Our investment strategy is to originate, acquire and manage a portfolio of senior loans secured by commercial real estate primarily in the United States . We are focused on senior floating-rate mortgage loans, but we may also invest in other real estate-related assets, including: (i) other commercial real estate mortgage loans, including fixed-rate loans, subordinated loans, B-Notes, mezzanine loans and participations in commercial mortgage loans; and (ii) commercial real estate securities, including CMBS, unsecured debt of listed and non-listed REITs, collateralized debt obligations and equity or equity-linked securities. To a lesser extent we may invest in warehouse loans secured by commercial or residential mortgages, credit loans to commercial real estate companies, residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS, and portfolios of single-family home mortgages. 
 The success of our activities is affected by general economic and market conditions, including, among others, interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws and trade barriers. These factors could affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity of our investments. Volatility or illiquidity could impair our profitability or result in losses. These factors also could adversely affect the availability or cost of our leverage, which would result in lower returns. Future market disruptions and/or illiquidity would be expected to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unfavorable economic conditions also would be expected to increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events have limited and could continue to limit our investment originations, limit our ability to grow and have a material negative impact on our operating results and the fair values of our debt and equity investments.

 Macroeconomic Environment 
 Economic growth continued to be strong during the third quarter of 2024, driven by a stout U.S. consumer while inflationary pressures moderated to 2.4 as of September 2024. Treasury yields steadily declined throughout most of the quarter while the FOMC enacted its first rate cut in more than four years, which represented a seminal milestone in its fight against inflation. Activity and pricing within the CRE market continued to be subdued, but there are signs improvement may be near. Lower interest rates may help improve sentiment and promote higher transaction volumes while property values appear to have formed a trough during the quarter. We expect transaction and lending activity to pick up amid a lower-rate environment in the coming quarters but believe the outlook for property values may be less clear as base rates today are well above those from five and 10 years ago, a period that represents a normal investment holding period for a CRE property. Our borrowers could remain stressed by the combination of lower property values and elevated financing costs compared to those of several years ago.

 Results of Operations 
 The following table sets forth information regarding our unaudited consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net interest income Interest income 192,570 192,867 575,949 551,164 Less: Interest expense (118,066) (110,572) (340,422) (315,461) Interest income on mortgage loans held in securitization trusts 17,871 4,363 44,519 11,590 Less: Interest expense on mortgage obligations issued by securitization trusts (15,835) (3,425) (39,328) (9,283) Net interest income 76,540 83,233 240,718 238,010 Other expenses Management fee 9,614 9,092 28,526 25,514 Performance fee 4,190 6,354 16,141 17,742 General and administrative expenses 11,738 10,008 34,439 30,446 Real estate operating expenses 2,800 5,635 Depreciation and amortization 4,251 7,921 Interest expense on real estate 2,367 7,079 Less: Expense limitation (148) Add: Expense recoupment to sponsor 753 753 Net other expenses 34,960 26,207 99,741 74,307 Other income (loss) Credit loss expense, net 5,190 101 (54,507) (42,130) Real estate operating income 6,722 16,799 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on interest rate cap (1,761) (762) (3,509) (1,370) Net realized gain (loss) on mortgage-backed securities, fair value option 22 355 Net realized gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt 99 265 273 265 Net realized gain (loss) on real estate, net 357 357 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on mortgage-backed securities, fair value option (86) 45 355 325 Unrealized gain (loss) on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net 458 (213) 1,536 (742) Other income (loss), net (234) (1,931) Total other income (loss) 11,001 (798) (38,341) (45,583) Net income before income taxes 52,581 56,228 102,636 118,120 Income tax expense (478) (274) (1,748) (2,260) Net income 52,103 55,954 100,888 115,860 Preferred stock dividends (3) (3) (11) (11) Net income attributable to FS Credit Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. 52,100 55,951 100,877 115,849 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is generated on our interest-earning assets less related interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to debt investments acquired or originated in our portfolio and non-recurring prepayment fee income. The increase in interest expense was attributable to an increase in borrowings in order to support our investment activities. The increase in interest income on mortgage loans held in securitization trusts, and interest expense on mortgage obligations issued by securitization trusts was attributable to the consolidation of securitization vehicles. 
 Other Expenses 
 Other expenses include management and performance fees payable to FS Real Estate Advisor and general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses include administrative services expenses and fees, auditing and professional fees,

Table of Contents 

 independent director fees, transfer agent fees, loan servicing expenses and other costs associated with operating our business. The increase in other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 can primarily be attributed to the increase of our management fee and various general and administrative expenses related to the growth of our net assets. 
 Expense Limitation 
 We have entered into an expense limitation agreement with FS Real Estate Advisor and Rialto pursuant to which FS Real Estate Advisor and Rialto have agreed to waive reimbursement of or pay, on a quarterly basis, our annualized ordinary operating expenses for such quarter to the extent such expenses exceed 1.5 per annum of our average net assets attributable to each of our classes of common stock. Ordinary operating expenses for each class of common stock consist of all ordinary expenses attributable to such class, including administration fees, transfer agent fees, fees paid to our board of directors, loan servicing expenses, administrative services expenses and fees, and related costs associated with legal, regulatory compliance and investor relations, but excluding the following: (a) management fees and performance fees paid to FS Real Estate Advisor pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, (b) interest expense and other financing costs, (c) taxes, (d) distribution or shareholder servicing fees and (e) unusual, unexpected and/or nonrecurring expenses. We will repay FS Real Estate Advisor or Rialto on a quarterly basis any ordinary operating expenses previously waived or paid, but only if the reimbursement would not cause the then-current expense limitation, if any, to be exceeded. In addition, the reimbursement of expenses will be made only if payable not more than three years from the end of the fiscal quarter in which the expenses were paid or waived. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no expense recoupments were paid to FS Real Estate Advisor and Rialto. As of September 30, 2024, no expense recoupments were payable to FS Real Estate Advisor and Rialto. 
 Credit Loss Expense, Net 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our expected credit loss reserve increased by 54,507. Credit loss expenses relate to changes in the Company s general and specific current expected credit loss ("CECL") reserves for the Company s Loans receivable, held-for-investment and Mortgage-backed securities, held-to-maturity portfolios, and the credit loss allowance associated with the Company s Mortgage-backed securities available-for-sale. The increase in credit loss expense can primarily be attributed to specific CECL reserves on loans in our portfolio and new loans funded during the period. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
 We use Funds from Operations ("FFO"), a widely accepted non-GAAP financial metric, to evaluate our performance. FFO provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other REITs. Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") has promulgated a standard known as FFO, which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a REIT. As defined by NAREIT, FFO means net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of operating property, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. In addition, NAREIT has further clarified the FFO definition to add-back impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in unconsolidated entities that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate and to exclude the earnings impacts of cumulative effects of accounting changes. We have adopted the NAREIT definition for computing FFO. 
 Due to the unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives ("IPA"), an industry trade group, published a standardized non-GAAP financial measure known as Modified Funds from Operations ("MFFO"), which the IPA has promulgated as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which may be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT. 
 The IPA defines MFFO as FFO adjusted for acquisition fees and expenses, amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts on debt investments, non-recurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income, non-recurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 
 Because MFFO may be a recognized measure of operating performance within the non-listed REIT industry, MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it may be useful in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs. Like FFO, MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, as detailed in the table below, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we continue to acquire a significant amount of investments. 
 Our presentation of FFO and MFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs. We believe that the use of FFO and MFFO provides a more complete understanding of our operating performance to stockholders and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs. Neither FFO nor MFFO is intended to be an alternative to net income or to cash flows 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of our capacity to pay distributions. Management uses FFO and MFFO to compare our operating performance to that of other REITs and to assess our operating performance. 
 Neither the SEC, any other regulatory body nor NAREIT has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, another regulatory body or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO. 
 Our FFO and MFFO are calculated for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (GAAP) 52,103 55,954 100,888 115,860 Adjustments to arrive at funds from operations: Real estate depreciation and amortization 4,251 1,835 7,921 5,501 Funds from operations 56,354 57,789 108,809 121,361 Adjustments to arrive at modified funds from operations: Accretion of discount on mortgage-backed securities held-to-maturity (749) (679) (2,192) (6,055) Straight-line rental income (126) (547) (1,916) (2,877) Net change in unrealized (gain) loss on interest rate cap 1,761 762 3,509 1,370 Credit loss expense, net (5,190) (101) 54,507 42,130 Net change in unrealized (gain) loss on mortgage-backed securities fair value option 86 (45) (355) (325) Unrealized (gain) loss on mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts, net (458) 213 (1,536) 742 Modified funds from operations 51,678 57,392 160,826 156,346 
 
 NAV per Share 
 FS Real Estate Advisor calculates our NAV per share in accordance with the valuation guidelines approved by our board of directors for the purposes of establishing a price for shares sold in our public offering as well as establishing a repurchase price for shares repurchased pursuant to our share repurchase plan. 
 In general, our investments are valued by FS Real Estate Advisor based on market quotations, at amortized cost or at fair value determined in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with the valuation guidelines approved by our board of directors, FS Real Estate Advisor calculates our NAV per share for each class of our common stock as of the last calendar day of each month. For purposes of calculating our NAV, FS Real Estate Advisor uses the following valuation methods: 
 Commercial real estate debt classified as held-for-investment is valued at amortized cost, net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees, and origination costs. Mortgage-backed securities are classified as held-to-maturity when we intend to and can hold such securities until maturity and are valued at amortized cost, net of unamortized acquisition premium or discount. Our general CECL reserve is not considered impairment and is excluded from our NAV calculation consistent with other unrealized gains (losses) for investments expected to be held to maturity pursuant to our existing policy for calculating NAV. We recognize such potential credit losses in the NAV calculation if and when a loan is deemed impaired. Impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due to us pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is determined to be impaired, the loan is written down through a loan specific reserve. See Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our accounting for impaired loans, including significant judgments and assumptions included. At least quarterly, FS Real Estate Advisor, with assistance from our sub-adviser, evaluates for impairment each loan classified as held-for-investment. 
 Mortgage-backed securities that we do not classify as held-to-maturity are reported at fair value. On a monthly basis, FS Real Estate Advisor values such securities using quotations obtained from an independent third-party pricing service, which provides prevailing bid and ask prices that are screened for validity by the third-party pricing service on the valuation date. For securities for which there is no readily available market quotations, FS Real Estate Advisor values the security using current market data and a valuation provided by an independent third-party valuation firm. Each investment is valued by FS Real Estate Advisor no less frequently than quarterly. 
 Investments in real estate are initially valued at cost, which is expected to represent fair value at that time. FS Real Estate Advisor, with assistance from our sub-adviser, expects to receive an appraisal performed by an independent third-party appraisal firm on each property prior to or upon acquisition. Each property will then be valued monthly by the Adviser using current market data and a valuation provided by an independent third-party valuation firm. The independent third-party valuation firm will provide a monthly valuation for each property using the discounted cash flow methodology (income approach) as a primary methodology, although other industry standard methodologies may be used, including the sales 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 comparison and replacement cost approaches. Further, the independent third-party valuation firm will provide an annual valuation for each property, which will be consistent with its monthly valuation but will also reflect (i) property specific factors such as property income, cash flow forecasts, capital improvements and key performance indicators (e.g. occupancy rates) and (ii) market specific factors such as discount rates, capitalization rates and market sale transactions. 
 Liabilities include repurchase agreements payable, credit facility payable, collateralized loan obligations, mortgage obligations, fees payable to FS Real Estate Advisor and the dealer manager, accounts payable, accrued operating expenses, any portfolio-level credit facilities, and other liabilities. All liabilities are valued at amounts payable, net of unamortized premium or discount, and net of unamortized debt issuance costs. Liabilities related to stockholder servicing fees allocable to Class T, Class S, Class D and Class M shares are only included in the NAV calculation for those classes. Liabilities related to the base management fee is a class-specific expense for Class T, Class S, Class D, Class M and Class I shares, and the performance fee is a class-specific expense for Class T, Class S, Class D, Class M, Class I and Class Y shares. Class I PCRs will not be treated as a liability unless and until Class I shares are issuable pursuant to our advisory agreement and the Class I PCR agreement. 
 Commercial real estate debt and mortgage-backed securities held-to-maturity are valued at amortized cost, consistent with how they are recorded in accordance with GAAP, as these instruments are intended to be held-to-maturity. Liabilities are valued at amortized cost as these obligations are expected to be satisfied at their carrying value. See Note 9 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information including a comparison of our carrying value and an estimate of the fair value of our commercial real estate debt, mortgage-backed securities held-to-maturity, repurchase agreements payable, credit facility payable, and collateralized loan obligations.

 Discount rate and exit capitalization rate are the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation of our investment in real estate. A change in these assumptions would impact the calculation of the value of our real estate investment. For example, assuming all other factors remain unchanged, the changes listed below would result in the following effects on our investment values: 
 Input Hypothetical Change Office Investment Values Multifamily Investment Values Discount Rate 0.25 decrease 2.6 2.0 (weighted average) 0.25 increase (2.6) (2.0) Exit Capitalization Rate 0.25 decrease 8.4 3.3 (weighted average) 0.25 increase (7.7) (3.0)

 (11,662) Net asset value 2,991,582 _______________________ 
 (1) Stockholder servicing fees only apply to Class T, Class S, Class D and Class M shares. Under GAAP, we accrue future stockholder servicing fees in an amount equal to our best estimate of fees payable to FS Investment Solutions at the time such shares are sold. For purposes of NAV, we recognize the stockholder servicing fee as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis. As a result, the estimated liability for the future stockholder servicing fees, which are accrued at the time each share is sold, will have no effect on the NAV of any class. 
 (2) Our loans receivable and mortgage-backed securities held-for-investment balances include a general CECL reserve in our GAAP unaudited consolidated financial statements. For purposes of calculating our NAV, our general CECL reserve is excluded. We recognize a specific CECL reserve in the NAV calculation if and when a loan is deemed impaired, as described above. 
 (3) Our investment in real estate is presented at its depreciated cost basis in our GAAP unaudited consolidated financial statements. As such, any increases or decreases in the fair market value of our investment in real estate is not included in our GAAP results. For purposes of calculating our NAV, our investment in real estate is recorded at fair value. 
 (4) We depreciate our investment in real estate and amortize certain other assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. Such depreciation and amortization are not recorded for purposes of determining our NAV. 
 (5) Includes (i) straight-line rent receivables, which are recorded in accordance with GAAP but not recorded for purposes of determining our NAV, (ii) increases or decreases in the fair market value of our interest rate cap, which is recorded in accordance with GAAP but not recorded for purposes of determining our NAV. For purposes of calculating our NAV, the interest rate cap is amortized over its term, and (iii) other adjustments. 
 Limits on the Calculation of Our Per Share NAV 
 Although our primary goal in establishing our valuation guidelines is to produce a valuation that represents a fair and accurate estimate of the value of our investments, the methodologies used are based on judgments, assumptions and opinions about future events that may or may not prove to be correct, and if different judgments, assumptions or opinions were used, a different estimate would likely result. Furthermore, our published per share NAV may not fully reflect certain extraordinary events because we may not be able to immediately quantify the financial impact of such events on our portfolio. FS Real Estate Advisor monitors our portfolio between valuations to determine whether there have been any extraordinary events that may have materially changed the estimated market value of the portfolio, such as significant market events or disruptions or force majeure events . If required by applicable securities law, we will promptly disclose the occurrence of such event in a prospectus supplement and FS Real Estate Advisor will analyze the impact of such extraordinary event on our portfolio and determine, in coordination with third-party valuation services, the appropriate adjustment to be made to our NAV. We will not, however, retroactively adjust NAV. To the extent that the extraordinary 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 events may result in a material change in value of a specific investment, FS Real Estate Advisor will order a new valuation of the investment, which will be prepared by a third-party valuation service. It is not known whether any resulting disparity will benefit stockholders whose shares are or are not being repurchased or purchasers of our common stock. In calculating the number of shares outstanding used in calculating our NAV, we include the number of estimated Class I shares, if any, issuable to the adviser and the sub-adviser pursuant to the PCR Agreement based on the achievement of the Performance Conditions (as defined in the PCR Agreement), which estimate we will true up following the issuance of such Class I shares pursuant to the PCR Agreement. 
 We include no discounts to our NAV for the illiquid nature of our shares, including the limitations on the ability to sell shares under our share repurchase plan and our ability to suspend or terminate our share repurchase plan at any time. Our NAV generally does not consider exit costs that would likely be incurred if our assets and liabilities were liquidated or sold. While we may use market pricing concepts to value individual components of our NAV, our per share NAV is not derived from the market pricing information of open-end real estate funds listed on stock exchanges. 
 We do not represent, warranty or guarantee that: 
 a stockholder would be able to realize the NAV per share for the class of shares a stockholder owns if the stockholder attempts to sell its shares; 
 a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to per share NAV upon a liquidation of our assets and settlement of our liabilities or upon any other liquidity event; 
 shares of our common stock would trade at per share NAV on a national securities exchange; 
 a third party in an arm s-length transaction would offer to purchase all or substantially all of our shares of common stock at NAV; 
 NAV would equate to a market price for an open-end real estate fund; and 
 NAV would represent the fair value of our assets less liabilities under GAAP. 
 
 Review of our Policies 
 Our board of directors, including our independent directors, has reviewed our policies described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our registration statement and determined that they are in the best interests of our stockholders because: (i) they increase the likelihood that we will be able to originate, acquire and manage a diversified portfolio of senior loans secured by commercial real estate, thereby reducing risk in our portfolio; (ii) there are sufficient loan underwriting opportunities with the attributes that we seek; (iii) our executive officers, director, affiliates of our adviser and sub-adviser have expertise with the type of real estate investments we seek; and (iv) our borrowings will enable us to originate and acquire loan assets and earn revenue more quickly, thereby increasing our likelihood of generating income for our stockholders and preserving stockholder capital. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 219,894 in cash and cash equivalents, which we and our wholly owned subsidiaries held in custodial accounts. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had 2,155,066 in borrowings available under our financing arrangements, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded loan commitments of 259,911. We maintain sufficient cash on hand and available borrowings to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise. 
 We will obtain the funds required to purchase or originate investments and conduct our operations from the net proceeds of our public offering, the private placement of our Class I shares and any future offerings we may conduct, from secured and unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders, and from any undistributed funds from operations. Our principal demands for funds will be for asset acquisitions/originations, the payment of operating expenses and distributions, the payment of interest on any outstanding indebtedness and repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan. Generally, cash needs for items other than asset acquisitions/originations will be met from operations, and cash needs for asset acquisitions/originations will be funded by public offerings of our shares and debt financings. However, there may be a delay between the sale of our shares and our purchase/originations of assets, which could result in a delay in the benefits to our stockholders of returns generated from our investment operations. Our leverage may not exceed 300 of our total net assets (as defined in our charter) as of the date of any borrowing unless a majority of our independent directors vote to approve any borrowing in excess of this amount. Our board of directors will continue to review our ratio of leverage to total net assets on a quarterly basis, as required by our charter.

Table of Contents 

 If we are unable to continue to raise substantial funds in our public offering, we will make fewer investments resulting in less diversification in terms of the type, number and size of investments we make and the value of an investment in us will fluctuate with the performance of the specific assets we acquire. We have certain fixed operating expenses, including certain expenses as a publicly offered REIT, regardless of whether we are able to raise substantial funds in our public offering. Our inability to raise substantial funds would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income, reducing our net income and limiting our ability to make distributions. 
 Potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders or proceeds from the sale of assets or collection of loans receivable. 
 In addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, we expect to use our capital resources to make certain payments to FS Real Estate Advisor and FS Investment Solutions, the dealer manager for our public offering. During the offering stage of our public offering, these payments will include payments to FS Real Estate Advisor and its affiliates for reimbursement of certain organization and offering expenses. We will reimburse FS Real Estate Advisor for the organization and offering costs it or Rialto incurs on our behalf only to the extent that the reimbursement would not cause the selling commissions, dealer manager fees, accountable due diligence expenses, stockholder servicing fees and the other organization and offering expenses borne by us to exceed 15.0 of the gross offering proceeds from the primary offering as the amount of proceeds increases. FS Real Estate Advisor may be reimbursed for any organization and offering expenses that it or Rialto has incurred on our behalf, up to a cap of 0.75 of gross proceeds raised. FS Investments funded our offering costs in the amount of 27,279 for the period from November 7, 2016 (Inception) to September 30, 2024. Through September 30, 2024, we reimbursed 22,920 to FS Real Estate Advisor for offering expenses previously funded. As of September 30, 2024, 4,116 of offering expenses previously funded remained subject to reimbursement to FS Real Estate Advisor and Rialto. 
 Subject to the limitations in the advisory agreement and sub-advisory agreement, we expect to make payments to FS Real Estate Advisor in connection with the management of our assets and costs incurred by FS Real Estate Advisor and Rialto in providing services to us. The advisory agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of FS Real Estate Advisor and our board of directors. On August 1, 2024, our board of directors approved the renewal of the advisory agreement effective as of December 1, 2024 for an additional one-year term expiring December 1, 2025. For a discussion of the compensation to be paid to FS Real Estate Advisor and FS Investment Solutions, see Note 7 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table provides a breakdown of the net change in our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash flows from operating activities 182,382 201,619 Cash flows used in investing activities (175,916) (492,199) Cash flows from financing activities (42,573) 303,837 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (36,107) 13,257 
 Cash flows from operating activities decreased 19,237 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to the change in other assets and accrued expenses during the period. 
 Cash flows used in investing activities increased 316,283 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 com pared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to the net decrease of 262,149 in origination and fundings of loan receivables and an increase in principal collections from loans receivable of 159,101 . 
 Cash flows from financing activities decreased 346,410 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to a net increase in borrowings of 118,200 and the decrease in the issuance of common stock of 346,591. 
 We utilize our credit and repurchase facilities primarily to finance our loan originations on a short-term basis prior to loan securitizations, including through CLOs. The timing, size, and frequency of our securitizations impact the balances of these borrowings, and produce some fluctuations. The following table provides additional information regarding the balances of our borrowings:

Refer to the section of our Form 10-K entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for a full discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our accounting policies and significant accounting estimates. 
 
 Related Party Transactions 
 Compensation of FS Real Estate Advisor, Rialto and the Dealer Manager 
 Pursuant to the advisory agreement, FS Real Estate Advisor is entitled to an annual base management fee equal to 1.25 of the NAV for our Class T, Class S, Class D, Class M and Class I shares and a performance fee in an amount equal to 10.0 of the Core Earnings for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on average adjusted capital, equal to 1.625 per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 6.5 . We also reimburse FS Real Estate Advisor and Rialto for their actual cost incurred on providing administrative services to us, including the allocable portion of compensation and related expenses of certain personnel providing such administrative services. Further, origination fees of up to 1.0 of the loan amount for first lien, subordinated or mezzanine debt or preferred equity financing may be retained by Rialto or FS Real Estate Advisor. FS Real Estate Advisor has also received compensation for the structuring and negotiation of certain financing arrangements. Pursuant to the advisory agreement, we will reimburse FS Real Estate Advisor and its affiliates for expenses incurred relating to our organization and continuous public offering, including the allocable portion of compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments related thereto. FS Real Estate Advisor previously agreed to advance all of our organization and offering expenses until we raised 250,000 of gross proceeds from our public offering. In April 2020, FS Real Estate Advisor and Rialto agreed to defer the recoupment of any organization and offering expenses that may be reimbursable by us under the advisory agreement with respect to gross proceeds raised in the offering in excess of 250,000 until FS Real Estate Advisor, in its sole discretion, determined that we had achieved economies of scale sufficient to ensure that we could bear a reasonable level of expenses in relation to our income. We began reimbursing FS Real Estate Advisor in September 2020 and, as such, FS Real Estate Advisor may be reimbursed for any organization and offering expenses that it or Rialto has incurred on our behalf, up to a cap of 0.75 of gross proceeds raised after such time. 
 The dealer manager for our continuous public offering is FS Investment Solutions, which is an affiliate of FS Real Estate Advisor. Under the dealer manager agreement, FS Investment Solutions is entitled to receive upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees in connection with the sale of shares of common stock in our continuous public offering. FS Investment Solutions anticipates that all of the selling commissions and dealer manager fees will be reallowed to participating broker-dealers, unless a particular broker-dealer declines to accept some portion of the dealer manager fee they are otherwise eligible to receive. FS Investment Solutions is also entitled to receive stockholder servicing fees, which accrue daily and are paid on a monthly basis. FS Investment Solutions will reallow such stockholder servicing fees to participating broker-dealers, servicing broker-dealers and financial institutions (including bank trust departments) and will waive (pay back to us) stockholder servicing fees to the extent a broker-dealer or financial institution is not eligible or otherwise declines to receive all or a portion of such fees. 
 See Note 7 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our related party transactions and relationships, including a description of the fees and amounts due to FS Real Estate Advisor, compensation of FS Investment Solutions, capital contributions by FS Investments and Rialto, our expense limitation agreement with FS Investments and our purchase of a mortgage loan from an affiliate of Rialto. 
 FS Investment Solutions also serves or served as the placement agent for our private offerings pursuant to placement agreements. FS Investment Solutions does not receive any compensation pursuant to these agreements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 97 of the outstanding principal of our debt investments were floating-rate investments. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 higher interest rates applicable to any variable rate investments we may hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we may hold. However, many of our variable rate investments provide for an interest rate floor, which may prevent our interest income from increasing until benchmark interest rates increase beyond a threshold amount. To the extent that a substantial portion of our investments may be in variable rate investments, an increase in interest rates beyond this threshold would make it easier for us to meet or exceed our performance fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase in our net investment income and the amount of performance fees payable to FS Real Estate Advisor. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the FS Rialto 2019-FL1, 2021-FL2, 2021-FL3, 2022-FL4, 2022-FL5, 2022-FL6, 2022-FL7, the WF-1 Facility, the GS-1 Facility, the BB-1 Facility, the MS-1 Facility, the Barclays Revolving Credit Facility, the BMO-1 Facility, the Lucid Facility, the Mortgage loan, and the MM-1 Facility, borrowings are at a floating-rate based on SOFR, and the pricing rate for any specific transaction executed under the RBC Facility may be charged, pursuant to the terms agreed for that transaction, at a floating-rate based on SOFR. To the extent that any present or future credit facilities or other financing arrangements that we or any of our subsidiaries enter into are based on a floating interest rate, we will be subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates, when we have debt outstanding, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income, especially to the extent we hold fixed rate investments. 
 We may seek to limit the impact of rising interest rates on earnings and cash flows through the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates on loans secured by our assets. 
 The following table shows the effect over a twelve-month period of changes in interest rates on our interest income, interest expense, and net interest income, assuming no changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, including the accrual status of our investments, and our financing arrangements in effect as of September 30, 2024 : Basis Point Changes in Interest Rates Increase (Decrease) in Interest Income Increase (Decrease) in Interest Expense Increase (Decrease) in Net Interest Income Percentage Change in Net Interest Income Down 50 basis points (1)

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. 
 Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that we would meet our disclosure obligations. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors that appeared under Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented by our quarterly report on Form 10-Q. There are no material changes from the risk factors included within our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 We have adopted a share repurchase plan, whereby on a monthly basis, stockholders may request that we repurchase all or any portion of their shares. The repurchase of shares is limited to no more than 2 of our aggregate NAV per month of all classes of shares then participating in our share repurchase plan and no more than 5 of our aggregate NAV per calendar quarter of all classes of shares then participating in our share repurchase plan, which means that in any 12-month period, we limit repurchases to approximately 20 of the total NAV of all classes of shares then participating in the share repurchase plan. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased shares of our common stock in the following amounts, which represented all of the share repurchase requested received for the same period: 
 Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) 
 July 1 - July 31, 2024 1,571,927 24.52 1,571,927 August 1 - August 31, 2024 2,798,299 24.50 2,798,299 September 1 - September 30, 2024 2,951,806 24.40 2,951,806 Total 7,322,032 7,322,032 
 ____________________ 
 (1) Repurchases are limited as described above. 
 
 Sale of Unregistered Securities 
 On August 1, 2024, we received 150 relating to the sale of approximately 6,201 Class I shares to an accredited investor at the per share price of 24.1899. The sale of securities was made pursuant to a private placement exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder.
