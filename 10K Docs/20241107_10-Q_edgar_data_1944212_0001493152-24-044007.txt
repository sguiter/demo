Right will entitle the holder to receive one-seventh (1/7) ordinary share upon consummation of initial business combination. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of units (the Private Placement Units at a price of per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to DT Cloud Capital Corp. (the Sponsor ), generating
gross proceeds of to the Company. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one Private Placement Share and one right Private
Placement Right ). Each Private Placement Right will entitle the holder to receive one-seventh (1/7) ordinary share upon consummation
of the initial business combination. 

Transaction
costs amounted to , consisting of of underwriting commissions, of deferred underwriting commissions and
 of other offering costs. 

Trust
Account 

The
aggregate amount of per Public Unit) held in a trust account Trust Account established for the benefit
of the Company s public shareholders and maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, acting as trustee, will
be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in
U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment
Company Act ). Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company
to pay its taxes, if any, the funds in the Trust Account will not be released until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company s
initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend
the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to (A) modify the substance or timing of the Company s
obligation to redeem of its public shares if the Company does not complete its initial Business Combination within 9 months from
the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 21 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if the Company extends
the period of time to consummate a Business Combination) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights
or pre-business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of all of the Company s public shares if the Company is unable to
complete its initial Business Combination within nine months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 21 months from
the closing of the Initial Public Offering if the Company extends the period of time to consummate a Business Combination), subject to
applicable law. 

Business
Combination 

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering
and sale of the Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating
a Business Combination. Nasdaq rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have
a fair market value equal to at least of the balance in the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable
on interest earned) at the time of the signing of an agreement to enter into a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a
Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the
target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 

The
Company will provide its shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of a
Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means
of a tender offer. In connection with an initial Business Combination, the Company may seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination
at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against
a Business Combination. The Company shall not consummate such Business Combination unless the Company has net tangible assets of at least
 after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, either immediately prior to, or upon such consummation of, or any
greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to, such Business Combination. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the
tender offer rules, the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a public shareholder,
together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group 
(as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted
from seeking redemption rights with respect to or more of the public shares without the Company s prior written consent. 

If
a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the
Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender
offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the
same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. 

The
shareholders will be entitled to redeem their public shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially
 per public share, subject to increase of up to an additional per public share per month in the event that the Sponsor elects
to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination (see below), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in
the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to shareholders
who redeem their public shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as
discussed in Note 7). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s
rights. The ordinary shares will be recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial
Public Offering, in accordance with ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ). 

The
Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least upon such consummation
of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor
of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business
or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, offer such redemption
pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would
be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. 

The
Sponsor and any of the Company s officers or directors that may hold Founder Shares (as described in Note 5) (as defined the initial
shareholders are identical to the ordinary shares included in the units being sold in this offering except that the founder shares
are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below: the sponsor, officers and directors have entered into
a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares,
private placement shares and public shares in connection with the completion of the initial business combination, (ii) to waive their
redemption rights with respect to any founder shares, private placement shares and public shares held by them in connection with a shareholder
vote to approve an amendment to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing
of obligation to provide for the redemption of public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem of
public shares if the Company have not consummated the initial business combination within the timeframe set forth therein or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) to waive
their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their founder shares and private placement shares if
the Company fail to complete the initial business combination within nine months from the closing of this offering (or up to 21 months
from the closing of this offering if the Company extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more
detail in this prospectus) (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public
shares they hold if the Company fail to complete the initial business combination within the prescribed time frame). 

On
September 3, 2024, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent (the LOI with Shanghai Maius Pharmaceutical
Technology Co., LTD Shanghai Maius ). Shanghai Maius is a biopharmaceutical R D company focusing
on innovative formulations and targeted small-molecule chemical drugs. Its core products include small-molecule chemical drugs and peptide
drugs. Under the terms of the LOI, the Company would acquire of Shanghai Maius s outstanding equity and equity equivalents
or all of its business, with the deal structure to be determined later by the parties based on further due diligence findings and other
considerations. 

On October 22, 2024, the Company, Maius Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd., an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands Maius as said
below under Proposed Business Combination section, Maius Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., an exempted company limited by
shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands Pubco incorporated for the purpose of serving as the public listed
company whose shares shall be traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq ), Chelsea Merger Sub 1 Limited, a Cayman Islands
exempted company Merger Sub 1 ), Chelsea Merger Sub 2 Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company Merger Sub 2 ),
and XXW Investment Limited, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of British Virgin Islands as Maius representative
(the Shareholders Representative ), entered into a business combination agreement (the Business Combination
Agreement ). 

Subject to, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, (i) on the date
on which the closing actually occurs (the Closing Date ), Merger Sub 1 shall be merged with and into the Company (the
 SPAC Merger ), with the Company continuing as the surviving company of the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Pubco (the SPAC Merger Surviving Corporation and the separate existence of the Merger Sub 1 shall cease, and
(ii) on the Closing Date and immediately following the SPAC Merger, Merger Sub 2 shall be merged with and into Maius (the Acquisition
Merger , together with the SPAC Merger, the Mergers ), with Maius continuing as the surviving company of
the Acquisition Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Pubco (the Surviving Corporation and the separate existence
of the Merger Sub 2 shall cease. The Mergers and each of the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and
other Ancillary Documents (as defined below) are collectively referred to as the Transactions . 

The
Company will have until February 23, 2025 initially to consummate a Business Combination. However, if the Company anticipates that it
may not be able to consummate a Business Combination within nine months, the Company may extend the period of time to consummate a Business
Combination up to twelve times, each by an additional one month each time (for a total of 24 months to complete a Business Combination
(the Combination Period ), including automatic extension period). In order to extend the time available for the Company
to consummate a Business Combination, the Sponsor or its affiliate or designees must deposit into the Trust Account (approximately
 per public share), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each month extension. Any funds which may be provided
to extend the time frame will be in the form of a loan to the Company from the Sponsor. The terms of any such loan have not been definitely
negotiated, provided, however, any loan will be interest free and will be repayable only if the Company completes a Business Combination. 

Liquidation 

If
the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except
for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100 of
the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account,
including interest earned (net of taxes payable), which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders
(including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors,
proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations
to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. The underwriters have agreed to waive its rights to the deferred
underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination
Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the
redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available
for distribution will be less than . 

The
Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products
sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce
the amounts in the Trust Account to below per share (whether or not the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised
in full), except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and
except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Proposed Public Offering against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event
that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any
liability for such third party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust
Account due to claims of creditors by endeavouring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities
with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in
or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Going
Concern Consideration 

The
Company initially had 9 months from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering to consummate the initial Business Combination. If
the Company does not complete a Business Combination within nine months from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company
will trigger an automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles
of Association. As a result, this has the same effect as if the Company had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under
the Companies Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands. Accordingly, no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a
voluntary winding up, dissolution and liquidation. However, the Company may extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination
nine times (for a total of up to 21 months from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering to complete a Business Combination).
If the Company is unable to consummate the Company s initial Business Combination by May 22, 2025 (unless further extended), the
Company will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem of the Company s outstanding
public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the
funds held in the Trust Account and not necessary to pay taxes, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, the Company may not
be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of the Company s
public shareholders. In the event of dissolution and liquidation, the Company s rights will expire and will be worthless. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , management
has determined that if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time
from the closing of the IPO, the requirement that the Company cease all operations, redeem the public shares and thereafter liquidate
and dissolve raises substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ), which contemplate continuation
of the Company as a going concern.

Public Units, which includes Public Units upon the full exercise by
the underwriter of its over-allotment option, at a purchase price of per Public Unit. . 

All
of the public shares sold as part of the Public Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows
for the redemption of such public shares if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and
in connection with certain amendments to the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, or in connection
with the Company s liquidation. In accordance with the SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which
has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares subject
to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. 

The
Company s redeemable ordinary share is subject to SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has
been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either
accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the
instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption
value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting
period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. The accretion or remeasurement is treated as a deemed dividend
(i.e., a reduction to retained earnings, or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital).

Working
Capital Loans 

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of
the Company s directors and officers may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working Capital
Loans ). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds
of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the
Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust
Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans.

shares upon consummation of a Business Combination as the consideration related thereto has been included in the Unit purchase price
paid for by investors in the Initial Public Offering. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in
which the Company will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same
per share consideration the holders of the ordinary shares will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into ordinary share basis
and each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert its rights in order to receive 1/7 share underlying each right (without
paying additional consideration). The shares issuable upon exchange of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held
by affiliates of the Company).

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on July 7, 2022 as an exempted company with limited liability. We were formed
for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar
business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a target business. We are an emerging
growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. 

On
February 23, 2024, we consummated the initial public offering of 6,900,000 units, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters
of their over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 units on February 21, 2024. Each unit consists of one ordinary
share and one right. Each seven rights entitle the holder thereof to receive one ordinary share at the closing of a business combination.
The units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 69,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing
of our initial public offering on February 23, 2024, we consummated the private placement with DT Cloud Capital Corp., our sponsor, of
234,500 units at a price of 10.00 per private unit, generating total gross proceeds of 2,345,000. As of February 23, 2024, a total
of 69,345,000 of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement were deposited in a trust account established
for the benefit of our public stockholders at Morgan Stanley, with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, acting as trustee. 

Our
units started to be listed on The Nasdaq Global Market (the Nasdaq and began trading under the ticker symbol DYCQU 
on February 21, 2024. On April 10, 2024, we announced that the holders of the units may elect to separately trade the underlying component
securities of the units commencing on April 12, 2024. Those units not separated will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol DYCQU, 
and each of the ordinary shares and rights that are separated will trade on Nasdaq under the symbols DYCQ and DYCQR, 
respectively.

We
will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our
initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by
means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a
tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction
and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement.
The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be 10.05 per public share (subject to increase of up to an additional 0.03
per public share for each monthly extension in the event that the Sponsor elects to extend the period of time to consummate a business
combination). The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred
underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business
combination with respect to our rights. The Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to
which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and any public
shares they may acquire during or after our initial public offering in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 

As
we have entered into a definitive business combination agreement on October 22, 2024 (the Business Combination Agreement ),
which is within nine months after the closing of our initial public offering, we have been entitled to an automatic three-month
extension to the original nine months from the closing of our initial public offering to consummate our initial business combination.
As a result, we now have 12 months from the closing of our initial public offering to consummate our initial business combination, or
up to 24 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, which may be accomplished only if our insiders or their affiliates or designees deposit
additional funds into the Trust Account. If it is reasonably determined by us and Maius (as defined below) that we may not be able to
consummate the initial business combination by February 23, 2025, we will use our reasonable best efforts to cause the our board
of directors to approve that the date by which we must consummate a business combination is extended from February 23, 2025 to February
23, 2026 (such period by which we must consummate a business combination, as amended, and as may be extended in accordance with the provisions
of the Business Combination Agreement, the Combination Period ), provided that our insiders or their affiliates or designees deposit additional funds into the Trust Account. 

If
we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within the Combination Period, we will, (1) cease all operations except for
the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible, but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public
shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, divided by the number of the
then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including
the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption,
subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses
(2) and (3), to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable
law.

Proposed
Business Combination 

On
October 22, 2024, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement with Maius Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., an exempted company limited
by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands Maius ), Maius Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., an exempted
company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands Pubco incorporated for the purpose of serving
as the public listed company whose shares shall be traded on Nasdaq, Chelsea Merger Sub 1 Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company Merger Sub 1 ), Chelsea Merger Sub 2 Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company Merger Sub 2 ), and XXW Investment
Limited, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of British Virgin Islands as the Company shareholders representative
(the Shareholders Representative ). The mergers and each of the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination
Agreement or other ancillary documents are collectively referred to as the Business Combination. 

Termination 

The
Business Combination Agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances prior to the Closing (as defined in
the Business Combination Agreement), including, among others: (i) by mutual written consent of us and Maius; (ii) by us or Maius if the
Closing has not occurred on or before June 30, 2025 (the Outside Date (iii) by us or Maius if any law or governmental
order is in effect that has become final and non-appealable and has the effect of making the consummation of the Transactions illegal
or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Transactions (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement); (iv) by either
us or Maius if it is not in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder while the other party is in material breach of any of
its representations, warranties or obligations hereunder that renders or could reasonably be expected to render the conditions set forth
in the Business Combination Agreement incapable of being satisfied on the Outside Date, and such breach cannot or has not been cured;
(v) by us if we are not in material breach of any of our obligations hereunder and Maius fails to perform certain covenants set forth
in the Business Combination Agreement within the time period promulgated therein; and (vi) by either us or Maius, if we fail to obtain
the required shareholder approval upon vote taken thereon at a duly convened special meeting of shareholders. 

The
Business Combination Agreement and related agreements are further described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October
23, 2024. Other than as specifically discussed, this Quarterly Report does not assume the closing of the Business Combination or the
transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement. 

Form
of Sponsor Support and Lock-up Agreement 

Simultaneously
with the execution and delivery of the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor has executed and delivered to Maius a support and
lock-up agreement (the Sponsor Support and Lock-up Agreement ), pursuant to which, the Sponsor has agreed to, among other
things, (i) vote to adopt and approve the Business Combination Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Transactions contemplated
hereunder, and (ii) become subject to certain lock-up provisions with respect to certain Restricted Securities (as defined in the Sponsor
Support and Lock-up Agreement) held by it. 

The
foregoing description of the Sponsor Support and Lock-up Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
the terms and conditions of the Sponsor Support and Lock-up Agreement, a copy of which is filed with our Current Report on Form 8-K filed
with the SEC on October 23, 2024, 2024 which is incorporated by reference herein. 

Going
Concern Consideration 

The
Company initially had 9 months from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering to consummate the initial Business Combination. If
the Company does not complete a Business Combination within nine months from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company
will trigger an automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles
of Association. As a result, this has the same effect as if the Company had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under
the Companies Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands. Accordingly, no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a
voluntary winding up, dissolution and liquidation. However, the Company may extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination
nine times (for a total of up to 21 months from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering to complete a Business Combination).
If the Company is unable to consummate the Company s initial Business Combination by May 22, 2025 (unless further extended), the
Company will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100 of the Company s outstanding
public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the
funds held in the Trust Account and not necessary to pay taxes, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, the Company may not
be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of the Company s
public shareholders. In the event of dissolution and liquidation, the Company s rights will expire and will be worthless. 

5 

Our
management plans to address this uncertainty through the initial business combination as discussed above. There is no assurance that
our plans to consummate the initial business combination will be successful or successful by the deadline of completing an initial business
combination as described above. The unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

Risks
and Uncertainties 

We
are currently experiencing a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been significantly impacted by
geopolitical instability and economic uncertainties. For example, United States and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption
following the geopolitical instability resulting from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the recent escalation of the Israel-Hamas
conflict. In response to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO deployed additional
military forces to eastern Europe, and the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have announced various
sanctions and restrictive actions against Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities, including the removal of certain financial
institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system. Certain countries, including
the United States, have also provided and may continue to provide military aid or other assistance to Ukraine and to Israel, increasing
geopolitical tensions among a number of nations. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the escalation of the Israel Hamas conflict and the
resulting measures that have been taken, and could be taken in the future, by NATO, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European
Union, Israel and its neighboring states and other countries have created global security concerns that could have a lasting impact on
regional and global economies. Although the length and impact of the ongoing conflicts are highly unpredictable, they could lead to market
disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions
and increased cyber-attacks against U.S. companies. Additionally, any resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and
financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets. The political and economic intense between the United
States and China may also affect the business of the target of our Business Combination. 

Our
search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially
adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in geopolitical tensions
and economic uncertainties. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

On
February 23, 2024, we consummated the initial public offering of 6,900,000 units, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters
of their over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 units on February 21, 2024. The units were sold at an offering
price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 69,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering on
February 23, 2024, we consummated the private placement with DT Cloud Capital Corp., our sponsor, of 234,500 units at a price of 10.00
per private unit, generating total gross proceeds of 2,345,000. 

Following
our initial public offering and the private placement, a total of 69,345,000 of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and
the private placement were deposited in the trust account. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account,
including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and less taxes payable)
to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest from the trust account to pay our taxes. To the extent that our
equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held
in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions
and pursue our growth strategies. We intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily for identifying and evaluating
prospective acquisition candidates, performing business due diligence on prospective target businesses, traveling to and from the offices,
plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses, reviewing corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target
businesses, selecting the target business to acquire and structuring, negotiating and consummating the business combination.

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 671,186, primarily due to dividend income earned in
cash and investments held in trust account of 2,171,443, prepaid expenses of 29,495 and due to Sponsor related party of 147,614,
partially set-off by net income of 1,633,003 and change in accrued liabilities of 44,363. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash at bank of 167,526. 

On
August 5, 2022, we issued an unsecured promissory note to the sponsor, pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount
of 300,000 (the Promissory Note ). The Promissory Note is non-interest-bearing and payable on the consummation of the initial
business combination or converted upon consummation of the business combination into additional private units at a price of 10.00 per
unit. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the principal amount due and owing under the Promissory Note was 0 and 217,614,
respectively. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a temporary advance of 70,000 and 490,000 from the sponsor, respectively. The balance
is unsecured, interest-free and has no fixed terms of repayment. 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an initial business combination, our sponsor,
officers, directors, or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required Working Capital Loan ).
If we complete our initial business combination, we will repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds
from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 300,000 of such loans may be convertible upon consummation of our business
combination into private units at a price of 10.00 per unit. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no outstanding
balance of the principal amount due under the Working Capital Loan. 

Results
of Operations 

Our
entire activity since inception up to September 30, 2024 related to our formation, the preparation for the initial public offering, and
since the closing of the initial public offering, the search for a prospective initial business combination. We will not be generating
any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial business combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating
income in the form of interest income from the amount held in the Trust Account. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 760,262, which consisted of dividend income earned in investments
held in Trust Account of 917,865 and interest income of 7, partially set-off by formation and operating costs of 157,610.

to a registration rights agreement entered into on February 23, 2024, the holders of the insider shares, private placement units (including
securities contained therein), and units (including securities contained therein) that may be issued on conversion of working capital
loans or extension loans (and) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement signed on the effective

registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of initial business combination and rights
to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. We will bear the expenses incurred
in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

The
underwriters are to a cash underwriting discount of 2.5 of the gross proceeds of the initial public offering, or 1,725,000, upon the
closing of the initial business combination. On February 23, 2024 we issued 103,500 ordinary shares of 0.0001 par value each to Brookline
Capital Markets, a division of Arcadia Securities, at the closing of our initial public offering as part of representative compensation,
which have been received by Brookline. 

Administrative
Services Agreement 

On
February 20, 2024, we entered into an agreement with our sponsor, pursuant to which we agreed to pay our sponsor a total of 10,000 per
month for secretarial and administrative support services provided to us through the earlier of consummation of the initial business
combination and our liquidation. 

In
addition, our sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on
suitable business combinations. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in
connection with activities on our behalf. 

Business
Combination Agreement 

On
October 22, 2024, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement with Maius, Pubco, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and XXW Investment
Limited. The merger involves multiple steps and will result in the cancellation and conversion of various shares into Pubco s ordinary
shares. After the Closing of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, we will become a wholly owned subsidiary
of Pubco. The Closing is subject to various conditions, such as shareholder approvals and regulatory clearances (including the necessary
approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission). Additionally, related agreements such as the Key Company Shareholder Lock-Up
agreement, Key Company Shareholder Support agreement, and Sponsor Support and Lock-up Agreement (as defined in the Business Combination
Agreement) have been executed. See our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 23, 2024 for details. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from
those estimates. A critical accounting estimate to our unaudited financial statements includes the valuation of ordinary shares subject
to possible redemption. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates. 

8 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Our
management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have
a material effect on the Company s unaudited financial statements. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

JOBS
Act 

We
qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements
based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting
standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such
standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that
comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

As
an emerging growth company , we are not required to, among other things, (1) provide an auditor s attestation report
on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (2) provide all of the compensation disclosure that
may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (3) comply
with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s
report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (4) disclose
certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of
the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion
of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

This
item is not applicable as we are a smaller reporting company. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded that during the period covered by this Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
September 30, 2024, because of the identification of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating
to (1) inadequate segregation of duties within account processes due to limited personnel, and (2) insufficient written policies and
procedure for accounting, IT, financial reporting and record keeping. In light of these material weaknesses, we performed additional
analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, management
believes that the financial statements included in this Report present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results
of operations and cash flows for the periods presented . 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During
the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Except
as set forth below, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed
in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional
factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

The
Sponsor and our directors and officers have interests that are different from, or in addition to (and which may conflict with), the interests
of its shareholders, and therefore potential conflicts of interest exist in recommending that shareholders vote in favor of the Business
Combination. Such conflicts of interests include that the Sponsor as well as our directors and officers are expected to lose their entire
investment in the Company if the Business Combination is not completed. 

When
considering our board s recommendation to vote in favor of approving any proposals in connection with the Business Combination,
our shareholders should keep in mind that the Sponsor and our directors and officers have interests in such proposals that are different
from, or in addition to (and which may conflict with), those of our shareholders generally. 

These
interests include, among other things: 

The
 fact that immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination, the initial
 shareholders are expected to hold an aggregate of 1,993,000 Pubco ordinary shares on an as-converted
 basis, consisting of (i) 1,725,000 Pubco ordinary shares to be converted from our ordinary
 shares held by the initial shareholders, (ii) 234,500 Pubco ordinary shares to be converted
 from our ordinary shares underlying the private units held by the initial shareholders; and
 (iii) 33,500 Pubco ordinary shares to be converted from our ordinary shares underlying the
 private rights held by the initial shareholders, which in the aggregate, would represent
 approximately 5.7 ownership interest in the Pubco following the consummation of the Business
 Combination under the no redemption scenario,
 on an as-converted basis. 

The
 fact that the Sponsor acquired 234,500 units at a price of 10.00 per private unit through
 private placement simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering on February
 23, 2024. 

The
 fact that the initial shareholders paid an aggregate purchase price of 25,000, or approximately
 0.01 per share, for 1,725,000 insider shares prior to our initial public offering, which
 shall be surrendered to us to exchange for a share certificate representing the same number
 of Pubco ordinary shares at the SPAC Merger Effective Time pursuant to the Business Combination
 Agreement. All of the insider shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and could
 have a significantly higher value at the time of the Business Combination, which, if unrestricted
 and freely tradable, would be valued at approximately 17.9 million, based on the most
 recent closing price of our ordinary shares of 10.39 per share on November 5, 2024 

The
 fact that if the Business Combination or another business combination is not consummated
 by February 23, 2025 (or February 23, 2026 if we extend the Combination Period which
may be accomplished only if the Sponsor deposits additional funds into the Trust Account ), we will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, redeeming
 100 of our outstanding public shares for cash and, subject to the approval of its remaining
 shareholders and our board, liquidating and dissolving. In such event, the private units
 held by our initial shareholders would expire worthless. If the Business Combination is consummated,
 each of our outstanding ordinary share will be converted into one Pubco ordinary share. Given
 (i) the differential in the purchase price that the Sponsor paid for the insider shares,
 as compared to the price of the our ordinary shares, (ii) the differential in the purchase
 price that the Sponsor paid for the our private placement units as compared to the price
 of the public units, and (iii) the substantial number of Pubco ordinary shares that the Sponsor
 will receive upon conversion of the initial shares and/or our private placement units, the
 Sponsor may earn a positive return on their investment, even if public shareholders have
 a negative return on their investment. 

10 

The
 fact that the Sponsor has agreed that if we liquidate the Trust Account prior to the consummation
 of a business combination, it will be liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses
 or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted
 for or products sold to us in excess of the net proceeds of our initial public offering not
 held in the Trust Account, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that such debts or
 obligations do not reduce the amounts in the trust account and only if such parties have
 not executed a waiver agreement. 

The
 fact that our Sponsor, officers, directors, or their affiliates may, but are not obligated
 to, loan us funds as may be required Working Capital Loan to fund working
 capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an initial business
 combination. Up to 300,000 of such Working Capital Loan may be convertible upon consummation
 of our business combination into private units at a price of 10.00 per unit. 

The
 fact that the Business Combination Agreement provides for the continued indemnification of
 our current directors and officers and the continuation of directors and officers liability
 insurance covering our current directors and officers. 

The
 fact that Maius, the Sponsor and Pubco will enter into an amendment to the Registration Rights
 Agreement of our company on or prior to the Closing which provides for registration rights
 following consummation of the Business Combination. 

The
 fact that pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor shall promptly provide
 non-interest bearing loans to us (the Extension Loans for the sole purpose
 of extending the deadline for the consummation of our initial business combination, which
 shall immediately be repaid by us to the Sponsor and/or Maius (as the case may be) upon the
 earlier of the Closing or the expiry of the deadline for the consummation of our initial
 business combination. 

The
 fact that in addition to these interests of the Sponsor and our officers, directors and advisors,
 to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws and our memorandum and articles of association,
 waive certain applications of the doctrine of corporate opportunity in some circumstances
 where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual
 obligations they may have, and we will renounce any expectancy that any of our directors
 or officers will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware
 to us. We do not believe that the pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations
 of its officers and directors materially impacted its search for an acquisition target. Further,
 we do not believe that the waiver of the application of the corporate opportunity doctrine
 had any impact on its search for a potential business combination target. 

The
personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may have influenced their motivation in identifying and selecting Maius
as a business combination target, completing the Business Combination with Maius and influencing the operation of the business following
the Business Combination. 

There
is no assurance when or if the Business Combination will be completed. 

The
completion of the Business Combination is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Business
Combination Agreement, including, among others, (i) receipt of the required approval by our shareholders; (ii) receipt of the required
approval by the shareholders of Maius; (iii) effectiveness of the registration statement (which is to be prepared in connection with
the Business Combination and to call a special meeting of our shareholders requiring us to prepare and file with the SEC) declared by
the SEC; (iv) the approval for Pubco s initial listing application with Nasdaq; and (v) the absence of any law or governmental
order or legal injunction making illegal the consummation of the Business Combination, 

11 

No
assurance can be given that the required consents, orders and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to the completion
of the Business Combination will be satisfied. Even if all such consents, orders and approvals are obtained and such conditions are satisfied,
no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents, orders and approvals. We cannot provide assurance
that the Business Combination will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. 

Our
extraordinary shareholder meeting may take place before all of the required regulatory approvals have been obtained and before all conditions
to such approvals, if any, are known. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the proposal to conduct the Business Combination and the Transactions
are approved by our shareholders, we would not be required to seek further approval of our shareholders, even if the conditions imposed
in obtaining required regulatory approvals could have an adverse effect on us or Maius. 

The
approval of, or submission of filings with, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the CSRC ), may be required in connection
with the Business Combination. 

The
PRC government has expanded oversight over offerings that are conducted overseas by China-based issuers and foreign investment in China-based
issuers in recent years. On February 17, 2023, the CSRC released the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and
Listing by Domestic Companies (the Trial Measures ), and five supporting guidelines, which came into effect on March 31,
2023. According to the Trial Measures, domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas, both directly and indirectly,
should fulfill certain filing procedures and report relevant information to the CSRC. If the issuer meets both of the following conditions,
an overseas offering and listing will be determined as an indirect overseas offering and listing by a domestic company: (i) any of the
total assets, net assets, revenue or profits of the PRC-incorporated operating entities of the issuer in the most recent accounting year
accounts for more than 50 of the corresponding figure in the issuer s audited consolidated financial statements for the same period,
and (ii) the issuer s major operational activities are carried out in the PRC or its main places of business are located in the
PRC, or the senior managers in charge of operation and management of the issuer are mostly PRC citizens or are domiciled in the PRC.
The determination as to whether or not an overseas offering and listing by domestic companies is indirect, shall be made on a substance
over form basis. 

Pursuant
to covenants of Maius under the Business Combination Agreement, Maius shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill the filing
procedure with the CSRC and report relevant information in a timely manner per the requirements of the Trial Measures and the supporting
guidelines. Maius expects to submit the filing application documents according to the Trial Measures and relevant supporting guidelines
within three business days after filing the registration statement in connection with the Transactions with the SEC. It is uncertain
whether Maius will be able to, or how long it will take it to, obtain such approval or complete the filing procedures. Further, the CSRC
could rescind its approval after giving it. Any failure to obtain or delay in obtaining clearance of such approval or completing such
filing procedures for this Business Combination or the Pubco s proposed listing on Nasdaq, or a rescission of any such approval
obtained by Maius, would subject Maius to regulatory actions or other sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory authorities for failure
to obtain required governmental authorization. These governmental authorities may impose fines, restrictions and penalties on Maius,
which might make it advisable for Maius to suspend the Business Combination or the Pubco s proposed listing on Nasdaq. All of these
could have a material adverse effect on our and Maius ability to consummate the Business Combination, and could significantly
limit or completely hinder the Pubco s ability and the ability of any holder of the Pubco s securities to offer or continue
to offer such securities. 

There
is no assurance if any PIPE financing as contemplated in the Business Combination can be completed. 

Pursuant
to covenants under the Business Combination Agreement, we and Maius have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain executed
subscription agreements for an aggregate investment amount of no less than 10,000,000 from third party investors (such investors, collectively,
with any permitted assignees or transferees, the PIPE Investors ), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors make or commit to
make private equity investments in us, Maius or Pubco to purchase shares of us, Maius or Pubco in connection with a private placement,
and/or enter into backstop or other alternative financing arrangements with potential investors (a PIPE Investment ). We
may terminate the Business Combination Agreement at any time prior to the Closing if we are not in material breach of any of our obligations
in the Business Combination Agreement while Maius fails to perform such covenants in connection with the PIPE Investment within the time
period specified in the Business Combination Agreement. 

12 

Although
we will continue to work toward obtaining the PIPE Investment on market terms, no subscription agreements have been entered into as of
the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, there are substantial uncertainties with respect to the financing amount,
terms and timing of PIPE Investment, as well as the dilutive effect of such PIPE Investment to our non-redeeming shareholders. Furthermore,
there can be no assurances that such PIPE Investment can be secured at all. Lack of PIPE Investment may cause the Business Combination
to become less attractive to some investors, which may make it more difficult for us to complete the Business Combination. 

If
the Business Combination does not constitute an Exchange within the meaning of Section 351 of the Code, then the Business
Combination generally will be taxable to U.S. holders. 

Each
of us, Maius, Pubco, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 intend to take the position that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Transactions
constitute a single exchange transaction under Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Exchange ).
However, there is a lack of authority supporting the treatment of the Transactions as an Exchange, and accordingly there is significant
uncertainty that the Business Combination would so qualify. Neither us nor Maius intends to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the
U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination as part of an Exchange, and no assurance can be given that Business Combination
will qualify as part of an Exchange, that the IRS will not challenge this position or that a court will not sustain such a challenge
by the IRS. Further, the Closing is not conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion of counsel that the Transactions will constitute an
Exchange. 

If
the Transactions do not constitute an Exchange, then a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference
between the fair market value (as of the Closing Date of the Business Combination) of Pubco ordinary shares received in the Business
Combination, over such holder s aggregate adjusted tax basis in the corresponding public shares surrendered by such holder in the
Business Combination. Even if the Transactions otherwise constitutes an Exchange, U.S. Holders may be required to recognize gain (but
not loss) in the Business Combination under the PFIC rules. The tax consequences of the Business Combination are complex and will depend
on each U.S. holder s particular circumstances. 

We
may not have sufficient funds to consummate the Business Combination. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had US 167,526 of cash held outside the Trust Account. If we are required to seek additional capital, we may
need to borrow funds from the Sponsor, directors, officers, their affiliates or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate.
We believe that the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account, together with funds available from loans from Sponsor, its affiliates
or members of our management team will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the period ending on February 23, 2025 (or February
23, 2026 if we extend the Combination Period which
may be accomplished only if the Sponsor deposits additional funds into the Trust Account ). However, we cannot assure you that its estimate is accurate,
and the Sponsor, directors, officers and their affiliates are under no obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. 

Our
management concluded that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had US 71,516,443 of cash and investments held in the Trust Account to be used for a business combination or
to repurchase or redeem our ordinary shares in connection therewith. If we are unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity
needs and complete a business combination by February 23, 2025 (or February 23, 2026 if we extend the Combination Period which
may be accomplished only if the Sponsor deposits additional funds into the Trust Account ), we will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The liquidity condition and date for mandatory
liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
depend on a variety of U.S. and multi-national financial institutions to provide us with banking services. The default or failure of
one or more of the financial institutions that we rely on may adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

We
maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and our
deposits at certain of these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In
the event of the failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance
that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or delay in accessing these funds
could adversely affect our liquidity, business and financial condition.

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities 

In
August 2022, an aggregate of 1,725,000 insider shares were issued to our initial shareholders, for an aggregate purchase price of 25,000,
or approximately 0.01 per share. The insider shares held by our initial shareholders included an aggregate of up to 225,000 shares subject
to forfeiture by our sponsor to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment option was not exercised in full or in part, so
that our initial shareholders would collectively own 20.0 of our issued and outstanding shares after our initial public offering (excluding
the sale of the private units and the representative shares and assuming our initial shareholders did not purchase units in our initial
public offering). On February 21, 2024, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of our initial public offering on February 23, 2024, we consummated the private placement with DT Cloud Capital Corp.,
our sponsor, of 234,500 units at a price of 10.00 per private unit. This issuance was made pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act, as the transaction did not involve a public offering. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to the private
placement. 

Use
of Proceeds 

On
February 23, 2024, we consummated the initial public offering of 6,900,000 units, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters
of their over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 units on February 21, 2024. The units were sold at an offering
price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 69,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering on
February 23, 2024, we consummated the private placement with DT Cloud Capital Corp., our sponsor, of 234,500 units at a price of 10.00
per private unit, generating total gross proceeds of 2,345,000. 

As
of February 23, 2024, a total of 69,345,000 of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement were deposited
in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders at Morgan Stanley, with Continental Stock Transfer Trust
Company, acting as trustee. 

Brookline
Capital Markets, a division of Arcadia Securities, LLC served as the representative of the underwriters of our initial public offering. 

The
securities sold in our initial public offering were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form
S-1 (File No. 333-267184) (the Registration Statement ). The SEC declared the Registration Statement effective on February
14, 2024. 

There
has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement as described in
our final prospectus dated February 20, 2024 .
