 NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (dollar and share amounts in thousands, except per share data) 
 (unaudited) 
 
 Note 1. 
 
 Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The balance sheet as of April 27, 2024 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but it does not include all the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024, which are contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year. 
 Daktronics, Inc. operates on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, with our fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to April 30 of each year. When April 30 falls on a Wednesday, the fiscal year ends on the preceding Saturday. Within each fiscal year, each quarter is comprised of 13-week periods following the beginning of each fiscal year. In each 53-week fiscal year, an additional week is added to the first quarter, and each of the last three quarters is comprised of a 13-week period. The six months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023 contained operating results for 26 weeks. 
 There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies and estimates as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024. 
 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 Restricted cash Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows

 We determined both entities are variable interest entities, and based on management's analysis, we determined that Daktronics is not the primary beneficiary because the power criterion was not met. Therefore, as Daktronics does not have control, but is able to exercise significant influence, the investments in Miortech and XDC are accounted for under the equity method. Our proportional share of the respective affiliates' losses is included in the "Other expense and debt issuance costs write-off, net" line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the three and six months ended October 26, 2024, our share of the losses of our affiliates was and as compared to and for the three and six months ended October 28, 2023.

 Contract balances 
 Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed and include unbilled receivables. Unbilled receivables, which represent an unconditional right to payment subject only to the passage of time, are reclassified to accounts receivable when they are billed according to the contract terms. Contract liabilities represent amounts billed to customers in excess of revenue recognized to date.

 The changes in our contract assets and contract liabilities from April 27, 2024 to October 26, 2024 were due to the timing of billing schedules and revenue recognition, which can vary significantly depending on the contractual payment terms and the seasonality of the sports markets. We had significant impairments of contract assets for the six months ended October 26, 2024. 
 For service-type warranty contracts, we allocate revenue to this performance obligation, recognize the revenue over time, and recognize costs as incurred. Earned and unearned revenues for these contracts are included in the "Contract assets" and

 We have numerous customers worldwide for sales of our products and services, and no customer accounted for 10 percent or more of net sales; therefore, we are not economically dependent on a limited number of customers for the sale of our products and services. 
 We have numerous raw material and component suppliers, and no supplier accounts for 10 percent or more of our cost of sales; however, we have a complex global supply chain subject to geopolitical and transportation risks and a number of single-source suppliers that could limit our supply or cause delays in obtaining raw materials and components needed in manufacturing.

 Credit Agreements 
 On May 11, 2023, we closed on a senior credit facility (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Facility consists of a asset-based revolving credit facility (the "ABL") maturing on May 11, 2026, which is secured by a first priority lien on the Company's assets, and a delayed draw loan (the "Delayed Draw Loan") secured by a first priority mortgage on our Brookings, South Dakota real estate (the "Mortgage"). 
 Under the ABL, certain factors can impact our borrowing capacity. As of October 26, 2024, our borrowing capacity was , there were borrowings outstanding, and there was used to secure letters of credit outstanding. The interest rate on the ABL is set on a sliding scale based on the trailing 12-month fixed charge coverage and ranges from to percent over the standard overnight financing rate (SOFR). 
 The Delayed Draw Loan was funded on July 7, 2023. It amortizes over years and has monthly payments of . The Delayed Draw Loan is subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement dated as of May 11, 2023 (the "Credit Agreement") and matures on May 11, 2026. The interest rate on the Delayed Draw Loan is set on a sliding scale based on the trailing 12-month fixed charge coverage ratio and ranges between and percent over the Commercial Bank Floating Rate (CBFR). The interest rate as of October 26, 2024 for Delayed Draw Loan was percent. 
 Convertible Note 
 On May 11, 2023, we borrowed in aggregate principal amount evidenced by the secured Convertible Note due May 11, 2027. Alta Fox Opportunities Fund, LP, as the holder (the "Holder") of the Convertible Note, has a second priority lien on assets securing the ABL facility and a first priority lien on substantially all of the other assets of the Company, excluding all real property. 
 Conversion Features 
 The Convertible Note allows the Holder and any of the Holder s permitted transferees, donees, pledgees, assignees or successors-in-interest (collectively, the Selling Shareholders to convert all or any portion of the principal amount of the Convertible Note, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and any other unpaid amounts, including late charges, if any (together, the Conversion Amount ), into shares of the Company s common stock at an initial conversion price of per share, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Note (the Conversion Price ). 
 The Company also has a forced conversion right, which is exercisable on the occurrence of certain conditions set forth in the Convertible Note, pursuant to which it can cause all or any portion of the outstanding and unpaid Conversion Amount to be converted into shares of common stock at the Conversion Price. 
 Additionally, if the Company fails other than by reason of a failure by the Holder to comply with its obligations, the Holder is permitted to cash payments from the Company until such conversion failure is cured. 
 
 Redemption Features 
 
 If the Company were to have an "Event of Default", as defined by the Convertible Note, then the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of the Convertible Note.

 percent when interest is paid in cash or an annual rate of percent if interest is paid in kind. Upon an event of default under the Convertible Note, the annual interest rate will increase to percent. The annual rate of percent was used to calculate the interest accrued as of October 26, 2024, as interest will be paid in cash. 
 
 We elected the fair value option to account for the Convertible Note as described in "Note 10. Fair Value Measurement" of the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q. The financial liability was initially measured at its issue-date fair value and is subsequently remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. We have elected to present the fair value and the accrued interest component separately in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Therefore, interest will be recognized and accrued separately in interest expense, with changes in fair value of the Convertible Note presented in the "Change in fair value of convertible note" line item in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Redemption of convertible promissory note Fair value change recognized Balance as of October 26, 2024 
 
 The estimated fair value of the Convertible Note upon its issuance date of May 11, 2023 was computed using the binomial lattice model. Given the appreciation of the Company s stock price since inception of the Convertible Note combined with our intent and expectation of settlement as soon as is feasible through exercise of its forced conversion right, we determined that the Monte Carlo simulation ("MCS") model was appropriately suited to determine the fair value of the Convertible Note as of October 26, 2024. Both models incorporate significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. 
 
 Yield Volatility (Annual) Dividend Yield (Annual) 
 The Credit Agreement and the Convertible Note require a fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than and include other customary non-financial covenants. As of October 26, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the Credit Agreement and the Convertible Note. 
 Debt Issuance Costs 
 Debt issuance costs incurred and capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the associated debt agreement. If early principal payments or conversions occur, a proportional amount of unamortized debt issuance costs are expensed. As part of these financings, we capitalized in debt issuance costs. During the six months ended

 We elected to value the Convertible Note at fair value in accordance with ASC 825-10-15-4(a) because of the embedded derivatives contained in the Convertible Note. The fair value of the Convertible Note as of April 27, 2024 was estimated using the binomial lattice model. The fair value of the Convertible Note as of October 26, 2024 was estimated using the MCS. Both models allow for the examination of the value to a holder and understanding the investment decision that would occur at each node. 
 
 The fair value of the Convertible Note entered into during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was classified as Level 3 because certain inputs for the valuation were not readily determinable or observable.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This section entitled "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" MD A is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results. The MD A provides a narrative analysis explaining the reasons for material changes in the Company s (i) financial condition during the period from the most recent fiscal year-end, April 27, 2024, to and including October 26, 2024 and (ii) results of operations during the current fiscal period(s) as compared to the corresponding period(s) of the preceding fiscal year. 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the MD A, contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. The words "may," "would," "could," "should," "will," "expect," "estimate," "anticipate," "believe," "intend," "plan," "forecast," "project" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any and all forecasts and projections in this document are forward-looking statements and are based on management s current expectations or beliefs. From time to time, we may also provide oral and written forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public, such as press releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, or other communications by us. Any or all forward-looking statements in this report and in any public statements we make could be materially different from actual results. Accordingly, we wish to caution investors that any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in economic and market conditions, management of growth, timing and magnitude of future contracts and orders, fluctuations in margins, the introduction of new products and technology, the impact of adverse weather conditions, increased regulation, and the other risk factors described more fully in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024 filed with the SEC, as well as other publicly available information about the Company. 
 We also wish to caution investors that other factors might in the future prove to be important in affecting our results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time; it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. 
 We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Our MD A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024 (including the information presented therein under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of Part I), as well as other publicly available information about our Company. 
 The quarter-over-quarter comparisons in this MD A are as of and for the fiscal quarters ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023 unless otherwise stated. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 Contribution margin is a non-GAAP measure we use and consists of gross profit less selling expenses. Selling expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs, travel and entertainment expenses, marketing related expenses (show rooms, product demonstration, depreciation and maintenance, conventions and trade show expenses), the cost of customer relationship management/marketing systems, bad debt expenses, third-party commissions, and other expenses. In addition to gross profit, management uses contribution margin as another measure of assessing segment profitability and allocating

 selling resources to each segment. Management believes that contribution margin is useful to investors because it permits investors to view and evaluate our segment financial performance through the same lens as management. 
 Overview 
 Daktronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries are industry leaders in designing and manufacturing electronic scoreboards, programmable display systems and large screen video displays for sporting, commercial and transportation applications. We serve our customers by providing high quality standard display products as well as custom-designed and integrated systems. We offer a complete line of products, from small scoreboards and electronic displays to large multimillion-dollar video display systems as well as related control, timing, and sound systems. We are recognized as a technical leader with the capabilities to design, market, manufacture, install and service complete integrated systems displaying real-time data, graphics, animation and video. We engage in a full range of activities: marketing and sales, engineering and product design and development, manufacturing, technical contracting, professional services and customer service and support. 
 Daktronics, Inc. operates on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, with our fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to April 30 of each year. When April 30 falls on a Wednesday, the fiscal year ends on the preceding Saturday. Within each fiscal year, each quarter is comprised of 13-week periods following the beginning of each fiscal year. In each 53-week fiscal year, an additional week is added to the first quarter, and each of the last three quarters is comprised of a 13-week period. The six months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023 contained operating results for 26 weeks. 
 
 Known Trends and Uncertainties 
 During fiscal 2024, we converted pandemic related pent-up backlog into record levels of sales and gross profit. In fiscal 2025 and beyond, we are more dependent on the timing, size, and profitability profile of the orders we win to be able to generate sales and gross profit at similar levels. We are investing in capacity and resources to grow the business and penetrate markets. As a result, we currently expect that our order volume and operating expenses in fiscal 2025 will exceed that of fiscal 2024. While the expansion of use of digital display systems in the global market is expected, actual market increases are uncertain, and a number of factors can impact customers' timing to commit to a system. We carefully evaluate our capacity and resource levels; however, there can be periods during which sales and expenses can be misaligned and impact our profitability levels. 
 Global investments have been made in manufacturing capacity and the advancement in display and control technologies. A majority of digital displays are constructed using standard surface mount display technology. Chip on board technologies are advancing for narrow pixel pitch (NPP) applications. Micro-LED technologies (also referred to as NPP) are being used and advanced, especially for displays installed for short viewing distances. Advancements continue in technologies related to digital displays used in professional services, including the use of artificial intelligence and other software which improve content creation, user interfaces, digital display monitoring systems, and security. We rely on a complex supply chain for raw material and component imports and the global distribution of our products. Governmental regulation changes, including recent announcements from the new US presidential administration about increased and expansive import tariffs and other geopolitical reactions could impact our costs and change the competitive landscape. We continue to monitor the evolving plans. We are adopting our manufacturing, sourcing capabilities, and product development priorities for these evolving changes in market and technology trends. 
 
 Overall, we have a unique leadership position in our target markets, which are large, growing, and enjoy resilient demand driven by our customers desire to improve their audience experience in sports, commercial, and transportation environments. To capitalize on this position, we are focused on digital and business transformation, improving our cost structure, and further growing our markets. To accelerate these initiatives, we are projecting to spend between 8 and 10 million for transformation efforts in fiscal 2025. In addition, we formed a Business Transformation Office (BTO), which has undertaken a comprehensive review of the Company s business, strategy and operations and is developing a set of strategic initiatives, enabled in part by the Company s previously announced digital transformation, to provide even better outcomes for customers, deeper penetration of the Company's current and adjacent market verticals, above-market growth, and more efficient delivery, fulfillment, and service. The goal of these initiatives is to grow revenue faster than the Company s addressable market, expand operating margins, and generate returns on capital in the mid-to-high-teens and consistently above the Company s cost of capital. 
 We believe the audiovisual industry fundamentals of increased use of LED display systems across industries and our development of new technologies, services, and sales channels will drive long-term growth for our Company.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 COMPARISON OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 26, 2024 AND OCTOBER 28, 2023 
 Product Order Backlog 
 Backlog represents the dollar value of orders for integrated electronic display systems and related products and services which are expected to be recognized in net sales in the future. Orders are contractually binding purchase commitments from customers. Orders are included in backlog when we are in receipt of an executed contract and any required deposits or security and have not yet been recognized into net sales. Certain orders for which we have received binding letters of intent or contracts will not be included in backlog until all required contractual documents and deposits are received. Orders and backlog are not metrics defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), and our methodology for determining orders and backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies in determining their orders and backlog amounts. 
 Order and backlog levels provide management and investors additional details surrounding the results of our business activities in the marketplace and highlight fluctuations caused by seasonality and multi-million dollar projects. Management uses orders to evaluate market share and performance in the competitive environment. Management uses backlog information for capacity and resource planning. Order fulfillment timing is dependent on customer schedules, supply chain conditions, and our capacity availability. We believe order information is useful to investors because it provides an indication of our market share and future revenues. 
 Our product order backlog as of October 26, 2024 was 236.0 million as compared to 306.9 million as of October 28, 2023 and 316.9 million as of April 27, 2024. The decrease in backlog to more historical levels is a result of fulfilling orders at a greater pace as supply chain conditions have stabilized and production lead times have improved, we have been utilizing our increased capacity, and our order pace has returned to more normalized rates. 
 We expect to fulfill the backlog as of October 26, 2024 within the next 24 months. The timing of backlog fulfillment may be impacted by project delays resulting from customer site conditions, which are outside our control.

 (1) Amounts are calculated based on unrounded numbers and therefore may not recalculate using the rounded numbers provided. In addition, percentages may not add in total due to rounding. 
 Net Sales: The sales increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024 was the result of comparatively higher volumes in the Live Events and Transportation business units offset by lower sales levels in the International business unit. Sales in our Commercial and High School Park Recreation business units were relatively flat. This sales mix difference is the result of variability of orders described below and because during fiscal 2024, the operating environment and supply chain stabilized. We were able to capitalize on our capacity investments to fulfill the overbuilt

 backlog and return to more normalized lead times, especially in the High School Park and Recreation market. These more normalized conditions have continued since and through the fiscal second quarter of 2025. The amount of revenue recognized associated with performance obligations satisfied in prior years during the three months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023 was immaterial. 
 Order volume decline in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to an order decrease in the Live Events, Transportation, and International business units. Variability in orders comparatively is natural in these large project business areas and during the time of year for sports projects. These declines were offset by large project bookings in the Spectacular niche and increases in the Out-of-Home niche and High School Parks and Recreation business unit. Digital billboard orders increased as a result of marketing efforts to independent billboard operators and the timing of a bulk order from a national Out-of-Home advertising company. The increase in order bookings in the High School Parks and Recreation business unit is attributable to sales of more higher selling priced video products versus fixed digit scoreboards. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to 26.8 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 27.2 percent for the same period a year ago. Total warranty expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 1.7 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 2.2 percent for same period from a year ago. 
 Selling expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 remained relatively flat compared to the same period last year. 
 General and administrative expenses increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024 because of higher personnel related wages and benefits for increased staffing levels, increased professional fees, and increased expenses for technology resources related to digital transformation strategies. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company incurred 3.3 million of consultant related expenses associated with the previously announced strategic and digital transformation initiatives. 
 Product design and development expenses increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 primarily due to personnel-related expenses and for increased staffing levels. Our focus has been to advance product features aligned with customer needs and to reduce product costs. We focused these efforts on both standard product and control offerings and in new emerging areas, including micro-LED products and new control capabilities. 
 Interest (expense) income, net expenses increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 primarily due to interest income earned on cash balances. 
 Change in fair value of Convertible Note results from accounting for the convertible note (the "Convertible Note") dated May 11, 2023 we issued to Alta Fox Opportunities Fund, LP during fiscal 2024 under the fair value option. The fair value change was primarily caused by the decrease in value of the embedded features of the Convertible Note, as our stock price has decreased since July 27, 2024. 
 Other expense and debt issuance costs write-off, net were relatively flat compared to the same period last year. 
 Income tax expense: For the three months ended October 26, 2024, our effective tax rate was 15.0 percent compared to an effective tax rate of 64.8 percent for the three months ended October 28, 2023. The lower tax rate is due to the reduction of the Convertible Note fair value adjustment to expense in proportion to the period's increase in pre-tax income, whereas the tax rate was higher in the prior period due to an increase in the fair value adjustment in proportion to the pre-tax income during the quarter.

 In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, sales increased and gross profit percentage declined slightly due to the following: 
 Commercial: Sales were relatively flat during second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period one year ago. The slight increase was driven by fulfilling orders in our digital billboards niche. Spectacular LED video display projects and

Table of Contents 

 On-Premise digital signage sales were similar to last year. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased due to a shift in mix to products with higher margins. Selling expenses remained relatively flat in dollars but decreased as percent of sales primarily because of leveraging flat selling capacity over increased revenue. The increase in order bookings in our Spectacular niche was attributable to LED video display project orders with governmental and multi-use commercial and retail facilities during the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Digital billboard order bookings during the quarter increased as a result of marketing efforts to independent billboard operators and the timing of a bulk order from a national Out-of-Home advertising company. 
 Live Events: The increase in net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was driven by fulfilling order backlog for upgrades in sports-related facilities, primarily in colleges and universities. The decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales in the quarter is partially attributable to sales mix differences between periods. Selling expenses decreased as a percent of sales and decreased in dollar amounts primarily because of a reduction in bad debt expense. Order bookings vary because of large project booking timing. 
 High School Park and Recreation: Sales were relatively flat during second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period one year ago. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased due to the market shift to more video projects, in addition to a more cost-effective video offering. Selling expenses increased primarily because of personnel related wages and benefit costs for investments in staffing to support future growth. Order bookings increase is attributable to more sales of video scoreboards versus fixed digit scoreboards. 
 Transportation: Sales were relatively flat during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period one year ago. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased as a result of a change in product mix and the recognition of a 1.0 million project related insurance reimbursement. Selling expenses increased primarily because of personnel related wages and benefit costs for investments in staffing to support future growth. Order bookings vary because of the timing of large project bookings which have inherent volatility. 
 International: The decrease in net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was driven by lower backlog and lower orders. Global geopolitical events and related macroeconomic trends have driven down the amount of market activity for digital display systems and large-sized projects, causing the decrease in orders. Gross margin decreased primarily because of underutilized factory capacity. Order bookings vary because of large project booking timing and have been impacted by general economic conditions.

 (1) Amounts are calculated based on unrounded numbers and therefore may not recalculate using the rounded numbers provided. In addition, percentages may not add in total due to rounding. 
 Net Sales: The net sales increase in the first six months of fiscal 2025 was the result of comparatively higher volumes in the Live Events and Transportation business units offset by lower sales levels in the Commercial, High School Park and Recreation, and International business units. The amount of revenue recognized associated with performance obligations satisfied in prior years during the six months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023 was immaterial. 
 Order volume growth was driven by rebounding demand in the On-Premise, Spectacular and Out of Home markets in our Commercial business unit and solid growth in the High School Parks and Recreation business unit. These higher orders offset an order decrease in the Live Events, Transportation, and International business units. Variability in orders comparatively is natural in these large project business areas.

 Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased in the first six months of fiscal 2025 partially because of sales mix differences between periods. Total warranty expense as a percent of sales decreased to 1.9 percent for the first six months of fiscal 2025 as compared to 2.2 percent for same period from a year ago. 
 Selling expenses increased because of increases in personnel related wages and benefits expenses for increased staffing levels to support future growth; travel and entertainment; and marketing, conventions and advertising. 
 General and administrative expenses increased in the first six months of fiscal 2025 because of personnel related wages and benefits for increased staffing levels, increased professional fees, and increased expenses for technology resources for our digital transformation strategies. In addition, during the first six months of fiscal 2025, the Company incurred 4.3 million of consultant related expenses associated with the previously announced strategic and digital transformation initiatives. 
 Product design and development expenses increased in the first six months of fiscal 2025 primarily due to personnel-related expenses and for increased staffing levels. Our focus has been to advance product features aligned with customer needs and to reduce product costs. We focused these efforts on both standard product and control offerings and in new emerging areas, including micro-LED products and new control capabilities. 
 Interest (expense) income, net increased primarily due to interest income earned on cash balances. 
 Change in fair value of Convertible Note results from accounting for the Convertible Note we issued to Alta Fox Opportunities Fund, LP during fiscal 2024, under the fair value option. The fair value change was primarily caused by the increase in value of the embedded features of the Convertible Note, as our stock price has increased since April 27, 2024. 
 Other expense and debt issuance costs write-off, net: The change in Other expense and debt issuance costs write-off, net for the first six months of fiscal 2025 as compared to the same period one year ago was primarily due to losses recorded for our equity method affiliates and foreign currency volatility. In addition, during fiscal 2024, we expensed 3.4 million of debt issuance costs related to the Convertible Note issuance. 
 Income tax expense: For the six months ended October 26, 2024, we recorded an effective tax rate of 35.2 percent, as compared to 37.6 percent for the six months ended October 28, 2023. Both periods' income before taxes included the impacts of the change in Convertible Note fair value adjustment to expense which is not deductible and is the primary driver of the effective tax rate for both periods.

Table of Contents 

 Commercial: On-Premise digital signage sales and digital billboards for the first six months of fiscal 2025 were similar to the same period last year; however, we fulfilled fewer larger sized Spectacular LED video display projects in the first six months of fiscal 2025, causing a decline in sales. In the first six months of fiscal 2025, there were fewer large sized projects in the market as compared to prior years. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased due to the market shift to more surface mount technology message centers and Spectaculars. Selling expenses remained relatively flat in dollars; however, they increased as percent of sales. Order bookings increased in our Spectacular LED video display projects. Digital billboard order bookings increased as a result in our marketing efforts to independent billboard operators. 
 Live Events: The increase in net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was driven by fulfilling the order backlog for upgrades in sports-related facilities, primarily in colleges and universities. The decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales is partially attributable to the sales mix differences between periods. Selling expenses remained relatively flat in dollar amounts and decreased as a percent of sales. Order bookings decreased due to the variability of large project booking timing. 
 High School Park and Recreation: During fiscal 2024, we returned to normalized lead times, which led to higher sales in the first six months of fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2025's more normalized levels. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased due to the market shift to more video projects in addition to a more cost-effective video offering. Selling expenses increased primarily because of personnel related wages and benefit costs for investments in staffing to support future growth. Order bookings increased as a result of the trends for schools increasingly using video solutions which are larger dollar-sized transactions than traditional scoreboard projects. 
 Transportation: The increase in net sales during the first six months of fiscal 2025 was driven by fulfilling orders in backlog and continued order bookings, especially in large intelligent transportation system projects. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased as a result of a change in product mix and the recognition of 1.0 million project related insurance reimbursement. Selling expenses increased primarily because of personnel related wages and benefit costs for investments in staffing to support future growth. The timing of large projects is uncertain which causes variability in large project order bookings. 
 International: The decrease in net sales in the first six months of fiscal 2025 was driven by lower backlog and lower orders. Global geopolitical events and related macroeconomic trends have driven down the amount of market activity for digital display systems and large-sized projects, causing the decrease in orders. Gross margin decreased primarily because of underutilized factory capacity. Even with efforts to decrease selling and other operational costs, our International business unit operated at a negative 1.0 million contribution margin. Order bookings vary because of large project booking timing and have been impacted by general economic conditions. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Six Months Ended (in thousands) October 26, 2024 October 28, 2023 Dollar Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 62,820 44,311 18,509 Investing activities (12,383) (12,073) (310) Financing activities 2,033 15,919 (13,886) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 204 139 65 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 52,674 48,296 4,378 
 Net cash provided by operating activities: The 62.8 million of cash provided by operating activities during the first six months of fiscal 2025 was the result of changes in net operating asset and liabilities. During the first six months of fiscal 2025, cash increased due to accounts receivable collection, reduction in inventory, and decreases in contract assets.

Table of Contents 

 The changes in net operating assets and liabilities for the six months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023 consisted of the following: 
 Six Months Ended October 26, 2024 October 28, 2023 (Increase) decrease: Accounts receivable 6,123 (5,713) Long-term receivables (2,909) 553 Inventories 16,617 7,056 Contract assets 10,901 1,116 Prepaid expenses and other current assets (632) (570) Income tax receivables 306 326 Investment in affiliates and other assets (876) 256 Increase (decrease): Accounts payable (3,853) (14,734) Contract liabilities (1,106) (10,849) Accrued expenses 1,659 7,480 Warranty obligations (1,207) 1,151 Long-term warranty obligations 1,666 1,123 Income taxes payable (4,285) 649 Long-term marketing obligations and other payables 173 782 22,577 (11,374) 
 Net cash used in investing activities: During the first six months of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, purchases of property and equipment totaled 10.5 million and 9.2 million, respectively, and investments in affiliates were 2.0 million and 2.9 million, respectively. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities: During the first six months of fiscal 2025, financing cash inflow included the 4.2 million received for the exercise of stock options, partially offset by payments on notes payable. Cash inflow from the first six months of fiscal 2024 resulted from closing on the 25.0 million Convertible Note financing and the 15.0 million mortgage financing to add liquidity to the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. These inflows were offset by the payoff of our previous credit line of 18.1 million, expending 6.5 million of debt issuance costs, and principal payments made on the mortgage loan described below. 
 Debt and Cash 
 We maintain a 60.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility ("ABL") with a maturity date of May 11, 2026 subject to customary covenants and conditions. As of October 26, 2024, we had no borrowings against the ABL and 5.4 million used to secure letters of credit outstanding. We also have a loan of 13.1 million secured by a first priority mortgage lien on our Brookings, South Dakota real estate and 25.0 million evidenced by the Convertible Note secured by a second priority lien on the assets securing the ABL facility and a first priority lien on substantially all the other assets of the Company, excluding all real property. 
 
 On November 11, 2024, the Company issued notice to the holder ("Holder") to force the conversion of 7.0 million of the principal balance on December 3, 2024 of the Convertible Note at the conversion price of 6.31 per share into 1.1 million common shares. We will issue the shares upon the Holder s indicating the ability to take delivery of the shares under the maximum ownership provisions of the Convertible Note. In addition, on November 25, 2024, the Company received from the Holder a written notice to increase the Percentage Cap to 14.99 percent. This increase from the in-effect 3.00 percent maximum ownership takes effect 61 days after receipt of notice. The Company intends to convert the remainder of the Convertible Note over the next several months in tranches of up to 7.0 million in face value every 30 days, as practical and as provided for in the Convertible Note.

Table of Contents 

 As of October 26, 2024, we had 134.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and 40.8 million in borrowing capacity under our ABL. We believe cash flow from operations, existing line of credit, and access to debt and capital markets will be sufficient to meet our current liquidity needs, and we have committed liquidity and cash reserves in excess of our anticipated funding requirements. 
 Our cash and cash equivalent balances consist of high-quality, short-term money market instruments. 
 Working Capital 
 Working capital was 242.7 million and 209.7 million as of October 26, 2024 and April 27, 2024, respectively. The changes in working capital, particularly changes in inventory, accounts payable, accounts receivable, and contract assets and liabilities, are impacted by the sports market and construction seasonality. These changes can have a significant impact on the amount of net cash provided by or used in operating activities largely due to the timing of payments for inventory and subcontractors and receipts from our customers. On multimillion-dollar orders, the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to or exceed 12 months depending on the amount of custom work and a customer s delivery needs. We use cash to purchase inventory and services at the beginning of these orders and often receive down payments or progress payments on these orders to balance cash flows. 
 We had 8.7 million of retainage on long-term contracts included in receivables and contract assets as of October 26, 2024, which we expect to collect within one year. 
 Other Liquidity and Capital Uses 
 Our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth, maintain a reasonable liquidity and leverage ratio that reflects a prudent and compliant capital structure in light of the cyclically of business, reduce debt, and then, as allowed under any restrictive debt covenants, return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
 Our business growth and profitability improvement strategies depend on investments in capital expenditures and strategic investments. We are projecting to spend between 8 and 10 million for these transformation efforts and for our total capital expenditures to be approximately 27 million for fiscal 2025. Projected capital expenditures include purchasing manufacturing equipment for new or enhanced product production and expanded capacity and increased automation of processes; investments in quality and reliability equipment and demonstration and showroom assets; and continued information infrastructure investments. 
 In addition to capital expenditures, we plan to make additional investments in our general and administration expenses to execute our broad digital transformation strategies to modernize our service systems for field service automation, to advance our enterprise performance planning capabilities, and to improve and automate quoting and sales processes. 
 We also evaluate and may make strategic investments in new technologies or in our affiliates or acquire companies aligned with our business strategy. We are committed to invest an additional 0.5 million in fiscal 2025 in our current affiliates. We may make additional investments beyond our commitments. 
 We are sometimes required to obtain performance bonds for display installations, and we have an aggregate of 190.0 million bonding line available through surety companies. If we were unable to complete the installation work, and our customer would call upon the bond for payment, the surety company would subrogate its loss to Daktronics. As of October 26, 2024, we had 17.6 million of bonded work outstanding. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
 During the first six months of fiscal 2025, there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024 for additional information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments.
