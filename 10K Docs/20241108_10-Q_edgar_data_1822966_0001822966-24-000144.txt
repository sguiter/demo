All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-Q, including, without limitation, statements regarding our financial position and business strategy and the expectations, beliefs, intentions, plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as expect, believe, anticipate, intend, continue, could, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, will, would, estimate, seek and variations and similar words and expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report may include, for example, statements about: 
 our need for and ability to obtain additional equity financing or other sources of funding; 
 our financial and business performance, including financial projections and business metrics; 
 the ability to obtain regulatory approvals to deploy our SMRs in the United States and abroad; 
 forecasts regarding end-customer adoption rates and demand for our products in markets that are new and rapidly evolving;

 the potential for our business development efforts to maximize the potential value of our portfolio. 
 
 Such forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance, but reflect management s current beliefs, based on information currently available. Many factors could cause actual events, performance or results to differ materially from the events, performance and results discussed in the forward-looking statements, and there can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those we have anticipated. 
 
 Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, are described in the section titled Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K ). If one or more of those risks or uncertainties materialize, or if any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in those forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that we currently consider immaterial, or which are unknown. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. No person should take any statement regarding past trends or activities as a representation that the trends or activities will continue in the future.

 12. 
 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed significantly from the statutory rates, primarily due to the losses allocated to the NCI and the recognition of a valuation allowance as a result of the Company s new tax structure following the Transaction. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a minimal amount of foreign income tax expense, while incurring no such expense during the same periods in the prior year. However, during the third quarter, NuScale received a customer deposit from a Romanian entity subject to Romanian withholding tax in the amount of . This amount is included in Prepaid expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 and will be expensed as the revenue is recognized. No such amount was prepaid as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company has assessed the realizability of the net deferred tax assets and in that analysis has considered the relevant positive and negative evidence available to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets at NuScale Corp as of September 30, 2024, which will be maintained until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. 
 
 The Company s income tax filings will be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The Company will monitor the status of U.S. federal, state and local income tax returns that may be subject to audit in future periods. No U.S. federal, state and local income tax returns are currently under examination by the respective taxing authorities.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of NuScale Power Corporation should be read together with our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, together with related notes thereto. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. As used herein, NuScale, the Company, us, our or we refer to NuScale Power Corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 Overview 
 Our mission is to provide scalable advanced nuclear technology to produce electricity, heat and clean water to improve the quality of life for people around the world. We are changing the power that changes the world by creating an energy source that is smarter, cleaner, safer and cost competitive. 
 Our small modular reactor SMR ), known as the NuScale Power Module NPM ), provides a scalable power plant solution incorporating enhanced safety, improved affordability and extended flexibility for diverse electrical and process heat applications. Our scalable design provides carbon-free energy at a reduced cost when compared with gigawatt-sized nuclear facilities. 
 Since our founding in 2007, we have made significant progress towards commercializing the first SMR in the United States. In 2017, we submitted our Design Certification Application DCA to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC ). On August 28, 2020, the NRC issued its Final Safety Evaluation Report, representing the NRC s completion of its technical review. On September 11, 2020, the NRC issued its Standard Design Approval SDA of our NPM and scalable plant design. With this phase of NuScale s DCA now complete, customers may proceed with plans to develop NuScale power plants with the understanding that the NRC has approved the safety aspects of the NPM and plant design. We expect the Company will continue to experience operating losses and negative operating cash flow until the commercialization of the NPM. On January 19, 2023, the NRC published in the Federal Register a final rule that certifies NuScale s SMR design for use in the United States, which became effective 30 days after publication. 
 
 In January 2023, the Company submitted a SDA Application and the associated licensing topical reports to the NRC for NuScale s 6-unit 77 MWe NPM design. Once approved, customers in the United States will be able to reference the certified design and SDA for expedited construction and operating licensing of NuScale s SMR pursuant to 10 CFR Part 52. On July 31, 2023, the NRC formally announced that it has accepted the Company s SDA Application for formal review. Based on the NRC s published schedule for SDA Application review, we expect the NRC will complete its review and SDA approval will be received by July 31, 2025. 
 
 The Company currently has only one Class 1 customer: RoPower Nuclear S.A. RoPower ), which is a joint venture established by S.N. Nuclearelectrica S.A. Nuclearelectrica and Nova Power Gas S.A. In November 2023, we entered into the Release Agreement with CFPP LLC, the Company s first customer, pursuant to which the Company agreed to terminate the Development Cost Reimbursement Agreement DCRA ), as amended, and our Long Lead Material Reimbursement Agreement LLM Agreement ). CFPP LLC was receiving funding for approximately 79 of its qualified project costs, including the long-lead materials LLM ), under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Energy DOE ). Under the Release Agreement, we agreed to repay CFPP LLC s Net Development Costs. Upon final settlement of the LLM Agreement, and once DOE is compensated for its investment in the LLM (stemming from DOE s funding under its cost share agreement with CFPP LLC), NuScale will obtain all rights and obligations associated with the LLM. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 As we continue to transition from a R D company toward the commercialization of our SMR, we continue to expand our array of products and services. During the third fiscal quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a revenue generating agreement with a customer, structured as a fixed price contract with variable consideration. Under this fixed price contract, all amounts currently collected are deferred and included in Customer deposit on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, with revenue to be recognized as performance obligations are achieved.

 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Revenue and Cost of Sales 
 The decrease in revenue and cost of sales was attributable to the loss of the contract with CFPP LLC. 
 
 Research and Development 
 R D expenses decreased as a result of 2.1 million in lower compensation costs associated with our transition from a R D-based company to a commercial company, while we also had lower professional fees of 49.4 million which is comprised of a 34.5 million CFPP LLC contract termination fee, combined with various internal cost optimizing measures. 
 
 Sponsored Cost Share 
 Sponsored cost share decreased due to decreased DOE funding and the loss of the CFPP LLC contract. 
 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 The change resulted from an increase in the Company s warrant price during the three months ended September 30, 2024, while the price dropped during the same period in the previous fiscal year. 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Changes in Presentation 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, amounts totaling 1.9 million were reclassified out of Other expenses and into R D expenses to conform to the current year presentation. 
 
 Revenue and Cost of Sales 
 The decrease in revenue and cost of sales was attributable to the loss of the contract with CFPP LLC. 
 
 Research and Development 
 R D expenses decreased as a result of 6.0 million in lower compensation costs associated with our transition from a R D-based company to a commercial company, along with lower professional fees of 74.5 million, which includes a 34.5 million CFPP LLC contract termination fee, combined with various internal cost optimization measures. 
 18 

General and Administrative 
 G A expenses increased due to higher strategic marketing expenses in the amount of 7.4 million, partially offset by lower professional fees and management successfully executing their strategy for controlling costs related to nonessential items. 
 
 Other 
 Other expenses decreased as a result of lower equity-based compensation in the amount of 2.2 million along with savings on nonessential expenses management has identified and eliminated. 
 Sponsored Cost Share 
 Sponsored cost share decreased as a result of the loss of the contract with CFPP LLC and decreased DOE funding in the current year. 
 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 The change resulted from an increase in the Company s warrant price during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while the price decreased during the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the ATM Program generated gross proceeds of 32.0 million and net proceeds of 31.2 million, while for three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the ATM Program generated gross and net proceeds of 8.3 million and 7.9 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the ATM Program generated gross and net proceeds of 106.5 million and 103.8 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we have 2,601,042 shares of Class A common stock authorized and available under the ATM Program at an aggregate sales price of up to 33.1 million. 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company issued and sold 2,601,042 shares of Class A common stock under the ATM Program for the gross and net proceeds of 32.5 million and 31.6 million, respectively. 
 Since NuScale s inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and have an accumulated deficit of 302.1 million, with negative operating cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 111.6 million, short-term investments of 45.0 million and restricted cash of 5.1 million with no debt. Historically, our primary sources of cash included investment capital, DOE and other government sponsored cost share agreements to support the advancement of the Company s SMR technology both domestically and abroad. As we transition from a focus on research and development to commercialization of our technology, the Company is focusing on commercial contracts that generate revenue. While we believe we have sufficient funds to reach commercialization of our NPM, certain costs are not reasonably estimable at this time, and we may require additional funding, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our projections anticipate certain customer-sourced income that is not assured and DOE funds which are subject to Congressional appropriations and dependent on the President signing it into law. 
 
 On January 5, 2024, NuScale announced a plan to reduce the Company s workforce by 154 full time employees, or 28 , in order to continue our transition from a R D-based company to a commercial company. This resulted in a one-time charge of 3.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company executed a revenue generating agreement with Fluor, whereby NuScale will provide engineering and design services in support of Phase 2 Front-End Engineering and Design for a VOYGR TM -6 Nuclear Power Generation project. 
 
 As a result of the cost-optimization plans implemented by management, the utilization of our ATM Program and the execution of customer contracts, we believe we will have sufficient funds available to cover required R D activities and operating cash needs for the next twelve months. Further, management plans to prudently manage its expenses and cash reserves into the future, including beyond the next twelve months, recognizing the need to secure additional customer commitments to support long-term operations. For additional information regarding these risk factors, see the Company s 2023 Form 10-K.

 Under the Release Agreement, the Company is required to have credit support to fund the amount of its potential reimbursement of demobilization and wind down costs with CFPP LLC. This account is identified as Restricted cash in the amount of 5.1 million on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet and acts as collateral for the 5.0 million letter of credit outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 In connection with DOE and UAMPS Award 8935, DOE designated NuScale as a subrecipient to UAMPS for the production of NPM 1, while classifying NuScale as a contractor or subcontractor for NPMs 2-6. As part of DOE s classification of NuScale as a contractor or subcontractor for NPMs 2-6, DOE noted that should NuScale fail to initiate commercial operation of NPM 1, DOE has the right to demand repayment of the fees invoiced for NPMs 2-6. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09). ASU 2023-09 requires that an entity, on an annual basis, disclose additional income tax information, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The amendment in the ASU is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The ASU s amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. ASU 2023-07 requires annual and interim disclosures that are expected to improve reportable segment disclosures, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.

Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 In the regular course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims incidental to the normal course of business. Other than as disclosed immediately below, the Company does not believe that any legal claims are material to the Company. Management does not believe that resolution of any of these matters will materially affect the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 
 On September 19, 2022, thirteen purported members and/or option holders of NuScale LLC filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon against NuScale LLC, Fluor Enterprises, Japan NuScale Innovation, Inc., and Sargent Lundy Holdings, LLC. The plaintiffs purport to represent a class of individuals who held common units or options to purchase common units in NuScale LLC and seek declaratory relief and damages based on breach of contract and other common law claims. The claims in the complaint are based on amendments to the operating agreement of NuScale LLC in connection with NuScale LLC s combination with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. On November 21, 2022, NuScale LLC, along with the other defendants, filed motions to dismiss. Plaintiffs filed a response on January 17, 2023, and NuScale LLC and the other defendants filed a reply on February 14, 2023. A hearing on the motions to dismiss was held on May 17, 2023. On August 3, 2023, the Magistrate Judge issued a report and recommendation that recommended that NuScale LLC s motion to dismiss be denied. On August 17, 2023, NuScale LLC filed an objection to this report and recommendation. On November 13, 2023, the District Court Judge entered an order accepting the report and recommendation. On December 8, 2023, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint, and on June 23, 2024, the Court denied this motion. Discovery is now ongoing. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of this matter, the Company does not believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the Company has not recorded any liability as a result of these actions. 
 
 Multiple shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon against the Company and certain of its current or former officers, namely John Hopkins, Chris Colbert, Robert Hamady and Clayton Scott: (1) Sigman v. NuScale Power Corp., et al. (Case No. 23-1689, filed November 15, 2023), and (2) Ryckewaert v. NuScale Power Corp., et al. (Case No. 23-1956, filed December 26, 2023). These lawsuits assert virtually identical allegations and claims and were consolidated before the same judge on February 2, 2024. The lawsuits assert claims under the federal securities laws and allege that the Company and members of management made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company s business, operations and prospects, and specifically about certain of the Company s agreements with customers. The Court appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 18, 2024 that makes similar allegations as the original complaints. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on June 17, 2024, and plaintiff filed a brief in opposition on August 1, 2024. Shortly thereafter, plaintiffs indicated they intended to seek leave to file a Second Amended Complaint to add allegations relating to the Company s disclosure about the SEC inquiry disclosed in the next paragraph of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Defendants consented to plaintiffs request to amend, with the express caveat that defendants believed the proposed amendment to be futile and defendants would move to dismiss any Second Amended Complaint, including any new allegations. On September 20, 2024, plaintiffs filed the Second Amended Complaint, and on November 1, 2024, defendants moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs response to Defendants motion to dismiss is due December 17, 2024, and Defendants reply is due January 24, 2025. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of this matter, the Company does not believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the Company has not recorded any liability as a result of these actions. 
 
 In December 2023, the Company received a voluntary request from the SEC s Denver Regional Office for information relating to its employment, severance, and confidentiality agreements, which the Company understood to be a part of a broader inquiry involving multiple companies related to the SEC s whistleblower provisions. The Company responded in January 2024 and had no further communications with the SEC. On July 30, 2024, the Company contacted the SEC following publication of an article by Hunterbrook Media. On July 31, 2024, the SEC made follow up requests for additional information relating to the December 2023 request. The Company is in the process of responding to those requests and intends to fully cooperate with the SEC. The Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of the SEC s investigation at this time. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 We are and may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us. 
 
 We are currently named in a number of purported class action lawsuits (see Legal Proceedings ), and from time to time, we are and may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to other matters, including intellectual property, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings, such as the SEC s current request for information regarding our 
 22 

employment, severance, and confidentiality agreements. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management s attention and resources from the operation of our business and cause us to incur significant expenses or liability or require us to change our business practices. 
 
 One of the existing shareholder class action lawsuits claims in part that NuScale LLC breached its prior LLC operating agreement or breached a duty of good faith and fair dealing in amending the LLC operating agreement in the Transaction without obtaining the consent of former common unit holders of NuScale LLC as a separate class. This class action lawsuit claims in part that the conversion of preferred units to common units, which occurred in conjunction with the merger, was inequitable to common unit holders. Plaintiffs are now seeking to amend their complaint to add a claim that this conversion itself breached the operating agreement. 
 
 The other shareholder class action lawsuit claims that NuScale and members of management made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company s business, operations and prospects, and specifically about certain of the Company s agreements with customers. While two causes of action were filed, these lawsuits have been consolidated before the same judge in the federal district court in Oregon. 
 
 While we disagree with all of the plaintiffs claims included in the class action lawsuits, the risk of loss if plaintiffs prevail would be material to the Company. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation and investigations, we may, from time to time, settle disputes and other proceedings, even where we believe that we have meritorious claims or defenses. Because litigation and investigations are inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business.
