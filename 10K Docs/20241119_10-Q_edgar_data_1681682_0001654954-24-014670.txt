Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (Unaudited) Note 1 - Nature of the Business ENDRA Life Sciences Inc. ENDRA or the Company has developed and is continuing to develop technology for characterizing tissue non-invasively, at the point of patient care, to broaden patient access to the safe diagnosis and treatment of a number of significant medical conditions in circumstances where expensive X-ray computed tomography CT ), magnetic resonance imaging MRI or other technologies are unavailable or impractical. ENDRA was incorporated on July 18, 2007 as a Delaware corporation. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management makes estimates that affect certain accounts including deferred income tax assets, accrued expenses, fair value of equity instruments and reserves for any other commitments or contingencies. Any adjustments applied to estimates are recognized in the period in which such adjustments are determined. Principles of Consolidation The Company s consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and/or entities as of reporting period ending date(s) and for the reporting period(s) then ended. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The balance sheet at September 30, 2024 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s annual financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all cash on hand and in banks, including accounts in book overdraft positions, certificates of deposit, and other highly liquid investments with maturities of one year or less, when purchased, to be cash. Cash equivalents include investments in an institutional money market fund, which invests in U.S. Treasury bills, notes and bonds, and/or repurchase agreements, backed by such obligations. Carrying value approximates fair value. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and periodically evaluates the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and has determined the credit exposure to be negligible. The Company maintains cash deposits at multiple banks to mitigate the risk associated with a failure of any specific bank. Inventory The Company s inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, with cost primarily determined on a weighted-average cost basis on the first-in, first-out method. The Company periodically determines whether a reserve should be taken for devaluation or obsolescence of inventory. The Company assessed its inventory at September 30, 2024 and determined that certain challenges, including potential damage and a longer timeframe for initial sales, warranted the establishment of an inventory shrinkage reserve. As a result, the Company recognized an inventory reserve of 5 amounting to 142,733, which resulted in the net carrying value of inventory of 2,711,923. 8 Table of Contents Capitalization of Fixed Assets The Company capitalizes expenditures related to property and equipment, subject to a minimum rule, that have a useful life greater than one year for: (1) assets purchased; (2) existing assets that are replaced, improved or the useful lives have been extended; or (3) all land, regardless of cost. Acquisitions of new assets, additions, replacements and improvements (other than land) costing less than the minimum rule in addition to maintenance and repair costs, including any planned major maintenance activities, are expensed as incurred. Leases Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company recorded a right of use asset of 229,771 and 354,091, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company recorded a lease liability of 237,162 and 365,919, respectively. Revenue Recognition ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC Topic 606 provides a single set of guidelines for revenue recognition to be used across all industries and requires additional disclosures. The updated guidance introduces a five-step model to achieve its core principal of the entity recognizing revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under ASC Topic 606, in order to recognize revenue, the Company is required to identify an approved contract with commitments to perform respective obligations, identify rights of each party in the transaction regarding goods to be transferred, identify the payment terms for the goods transferred, verify that the contract has commercial substance and verify that collection of substantially all consideration is probable. The adoption of ASC Topic 606 did not have an impact on the Company s operations or cash flows. Research and Development Costs The Company follows FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 730-10, Research and Development . Research and development costs are charged to the statement of operations as incurred. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred 794,444 and 1,632,849 of expenses related to research and development costs, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred 2,552,336 and 4,424,345 of expenses related to research and development costs, respectively. Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share The Company computes earnings per share under ASC Subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share . Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to the common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding (the denominator) during the reporting periods. Diluted loss per share is computed by increasing the denominator by the weighted average number of additional shares that could have been outstanding from securities convertible into common stock (using the treasury stock method), unless their effect on net loss per share is anti-dilutive. There were 181,974 and 788 potentially dilutive shares, which include outstanding common stock options, and warrants, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Options to purchase common stock 279 290 Warrants to purchase common stock 181,694 493 Shares issuable upon conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock 1 5 Potential equivalent shares excluded 181,974 788 9 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements Disclosures about fair value of financial instruments require disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, where it is practicable to estimate that value. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, the Company measures certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. The carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, including cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of notes payable and convertible notes approximates their fair values since the current interest rates and terms on these obligations are the same as prevailing market rates. Share-based Compensation The Company s 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan permits the grant of stock options and other share-based awards to its employees, consultants and non-employee members of the board of directors. Each January 1 the pool of shares available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan automatically increases by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the number of shares necessary such that the aggregate number of shares available under the Omnibus Plan equals 25 of the number of fully-diluted outstanding shares on the increase date (assuming the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock and other outstanding convertible securities and exercise of all outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares) and (ii) if the board of directors takes action to set a lower amount, the amount determined by the board. Effective January 1, 2024, the pool of shares issuable under the Omnibus Plan automatically increased by 982 shares from 756 shares to 1,738 shares. The Company records share-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Share-based Compensation Topic of the FASB Codification. The guidance requires the use of option-pricing models that require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, and the resulting charge is expensed using the straight-line attribution method over the vesting period. Stock compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of share-based awards that were expected to vest during the period adjusted for estimated forfeitures. The estimated fair value of grants of stock options and warrants to non-employees of the Company is charged to expense, if applicable, in the financial statements. These options vest in the same manner as the employee options granted under the stock incentive plan as described above. 10 Table of Contents Going Concern The Company s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has limited commercial experience and had a cumulative net loss from inception to September 30, 2024 of 99,289,095. The Company had working capital of 4,148,262 as of September 30, 2024. The Company has not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern and will require additional financing to fund its future planned operations, including research and development and commercialization of its products. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as going concern. The accompanying financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, but the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it establishes a revenue stream and becomes profitable. Management s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through sales of equity securities and borrowing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. If the Company is not able to obtain the necessary additional financing on a timely basis, the Company will be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of the Company s research and development activities or commercialization efforts or perhaps even cease the operation of its business. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company considered recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC, did not or in management s opinion will not have a material impact on the Company s present or future consolidated financial statements.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements The Company s warrant liability for the Series A and Series B Warrants is based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model utilizing management judgement and pricing inputs from observable and unobservable markets. Significant deviations from these estimates and inputs could result in a material change in fair value. The fair value of the warrant liability is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because the Company uses observable inputs like market prices for its common stock and risk-free interest rate, but requires estimations for factors like the Company s own volatility, which is not directly quoted in active markets. Measurement The Company established the initial fair value for the warrant liability on August 20, 2024, the date the warrants were issued. Upon exercise, the instrument is marked to its fair value upon exercise, and the shares delivered are recorded at fair value in the Company s statement of stockholders equity.

As of September 30, 2024, there were no legal matters that management believes would have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. Note 12 Subsequent Events Reverse Stock Split At a Special Meeting of Stockholders of the Company held on October 28, 2024 (the Special Meeting ), the stockholders of the Company approved amendments to the Company s Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation effecting reverse stock splits of the Company s common stock, and authorized the Company s Board of Directors, in its discretion, to effect a reverse stock split of Common Stock , whereby each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock would be reclassified and converted into a fraction of a share between and 1/35 (the Ratios and each, a Ratio ), inclusive (the November 2024 Reverse Stock Split ). Following the Special Meeting, the Board approved a Ratio of 1/35. The November 2024 Reverse Stock Split resulted in a proportionate adjustment to the per share conversion or exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exercise of outstanding preferred stock, stock options and warrants, as well as the number of shares of common stock eligible for issuance under the Omnibus Plan. All per share amounts (including exercise prices) and numbers of shares in the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively restated to reflect the November 2024 Reverse Stock Split. No fractional shares were, or shall be, issued in connection with the November 2024 Reverse Stock Split. Issuance of Shares The company issued 2,007 shares on November 11, 2024 and an additional 38 shares on November 13, 2024, for a total of 2,045 shares, primarily due to the exercise of 988 warrants. 18 Table of Contents Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q ), unless the context otherwise requires, the terms we, us, our, ENDRA and the Company refer to ENDRA Life Sciences Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and related notes thereto in this Form 10-Q. This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by those sections. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as believe, expect, may, will, should, could, would, seek, intend, plan, estimate, anticipate or other comparable terms. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-Q, including those regarding our strategies, prospects, financial condition, operations, costs, plans and objectives, are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding expectations for revenues, cash flows and financial performance, the anticipated results of our development efforts and the timing for receipt of required regulatory approvals and product launches. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our limited commercial experience, limited cash and history of losses; our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund our business operations in the future; our ability to achieve profitability; our ability to develop a commercially feasible application based on our Thermo-Acoustic Enhanced Ultrasound TAEUS technology; market acceptance of our technology; uncertainties associated with any future pandemic, including possible effects on our operations; results of our human studies, which may be negative or inconclusive; our ability to find and maintain development partners; our reliance on collaborations and strategic alliances and licensing arrangements; the amount and nature of competition in our industry; our ability to protect our intellectual property; potential changes in the healthcare industry or third-party reimbursement practices; delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines including potential delays in submitting required regulatory applications for Food and Drug Administration FDA approval; our ability to obtain and maintain CE mark certification and secure required FDA and other governmental approvals for our TAEUS applications; our ability to regain compliance with the listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market and maintain the listing of our common stock on such exchange; our ability to comply with regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies and to maintain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals; and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024, and in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. Available Information From time to time, we use press releases, X (formerly) Twitter (@endralifesci) and LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/company/endra-inc) to distribute material information. Our press releases and financial and other material information are routinely posted to and accessible on the Investors section of our website, www.endrainc.com. Accordingly, investors should monitor these channels, in addition to our SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts. In addition, investors may automatically receive e-mail alerts and other information about the Company by enrolling their e-mail addresses by visiting the Email Alerts section of our website at investors.endrainc.com. Information that is contained in and can be accessed through our website, X posts and LinkedIn are not incorporated into, and do not form a part of, this Quarterly Report or any other report or document we file with the SEC. Overview We are leveraging experience with pre-clinical enhanced ultrasound devices to develop technology for increasing the capabilities of clinical diagnostic ultrasound and other types of capital equipment, to broaden patient access to the safe diagnosis and treatment of a number of significant medical conditions in circumstances where expensive X-ray CT and MRI technology, or other diagnostic technologies such as surgical biopsy, are unavailable or impractical. Building on our expertise in thermoacoustics, we have developed a next-generation technology platform-Thermo Acoustic Enhanced Ultrasound, or TAEUS-which is intended to enhance the capability of clinical ultrasound technology and support the diagnosis and treatment of a number of significant medical conditions that currently require the use of expensive CT or MRI imaging or where imaging is not practical using existing technology. The first-generation TAEUS application is a standalone ultrasound accessory designed to cost-effectively quantify fat in the liver and stage progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD ), which can otherwise only be achieved today with impractical surgical biopsies or MRI scans. Subsequent TAEUS offerings are expected to be implemented via a second-generation hardware platform that can run multiple clinical software applications that we will offer TAEUS users for a licensing fee-adding ongoing customer value to the TAEUS platform and a growing software revenue stream for our Company. Each of our TAEUS platform applications will require regulatory approvals before we are able to sell or license the application. Based on certain factors, such as the installed base of ultrasound systems, availability of other imaging technologies, such as CT and MRI, economic strength and applicable regulatory requirements, we intend to seek initial approval of our applications for sale in the European Union and the United States, followed by China. In March 2020, we received CE mark approval for our TAEUS FLIP Fatty Liver Imaging Probe System, enabling its marketing and sales in the European Union and other CE mark geographies, including the 27 EU member states. In June 2020, we submitted a 510(k) Application to the FDA for our TAEUS Fatty Liver Imaging Probe FLIP System. In February 2022, we announced that we would pursue FDA reclassification and clearance of our TAEUS FLIP System through the FDA s de novo process. We subsequently voluntarily withdrew our 510(k) Application submitted a de novo request for the TAEUS system to the FDA in the third quarter of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the FDA sent us an Additional Information AI request related to our de novo application. After we received the AI request, we have had several interactions with the FDA and have provided additional information. In order to fully respond to the FDA s questions, we will need to compile additional clinical data, provide additional device test data, and respond to cybersecurity related questions in a new de novo submission. We had an in-person pre-submission meeting with the FDA on May 16, 2024. We currently anticipate completing the necessary clinical studies by the fourth quarter of 2024 or first quarter of 2025 and submitting the new de novo request to the FDA in the first half of 2025. 19 Table of Contents Financial Operations Overview Revenue No revenue has been generated by our TAEUS technology, which we have not commercially sold as of September 30, 2024. Research and Development Expenses Our research and development expenses primarily include wages, fees and equipment for the development of our TAEUS technology platform and the proposed applications. Additionally, we incur certain costs associated with the protection of our products and inventions through a combination of patents, licenses, applications and disclosures. These costs and expenses include: employee-related expenses, such as salaries, bonuses and benefits, consultant-related expenses such as consultant fees and bonuses, stock-based compensation, overhead related expenses and travel-related expenses for our research and development personnel; expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations CROs ), contract manufacturing organizations CMOs as well as consultants that support the implementation of our clinical and non-clinical studies; manufacturing and packaging costs in connection with conducting clinical trials; formulation, research and development expenses related to our TAEUS technology; and costs for sponsored research. We plan to incur research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we expect to continue the development of TAEUS and pursue FDA approval of the NAFLD TAEUS system. At this time, due to the inherently unpredictable nature of clinical development and regulatory approvals, we are unable to estimate with certainty the costs we will incur and the timelines we will require in our continued development efforts. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of headcount and consulting costs, and marketing and tradeshow expenses. Currently, our marketing efforts are through our website and attendance of key industry meetings and conferences. During the second quarter, we restructured our European sales operations to better align with the Company s near-term sales prospects. We expect to add to our sales representation and support headcount for operations in the EU as demand and resources permit in the future, and plan to begin staffing our sales efforts in the United States once we have obtained FDA approval for the sale of the NAFLD TAEUS device in that region. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our management and personnel, and professional fees, such as for accounting, consulting and legal services. We anticipate continued costs associated with being a public company, including expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market and SEC requirements, directors and officers insurance, increased legal and accounting costs and investor relations costs. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Warrant Liability The Company accounts for the liability classified warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging. Such guidance provides criteria for instruments do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company s statement of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 20 Table of Contents Management makes estimates that affect certain accounts including deferred income tax assets, accrued expenses, fair value of equity instruments and reserves for any other commitments or contingencies. Any adjustments applied to estimates are recognized in the period in which such adjustments are determined. Share-based Compensation Our Omnibus Plan permits the grant of stock options and other stock awards to our employees, consultants and non-employee members of our board of directors. Each January 1 the pool of shares available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan automatically increases by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the number of shares necessary such that the aggregate number of shares available under the Omnibus Plan equals 25 of the number of fully-diluted outstanding shares on the increase date (assuming the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock and other outstanding convertible securities and exercise of all outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares) and (ii) if the board of directors takes action to set a lower amount, the amount determined by the board. On January 1, 2024, the pool of shares issuable under the Omnibus Plan automatically increased by 982 shares from 756 shares to 1,737 shares. As of September 30, 2024, there were 1,458 shares of common stock remaining available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan. We record share-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Share-based Compensation Topic of the FASB Codification. The guidance requires the use of option-pricing models that require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the common stock options, and future dividends, and the resulting charge is expensed using the straight-line attribution method over the vesting period.

As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 99,289,095 and had 4,745,187 in cash. To date we have funded our operations through private and public sales of our securities and will need to raise additional funds in order to execute on our business plan, fully commercialize our TAEUS technology, and generate revenues. We need additional capital to allow us to continue to execute our commercialization plans. We are considering potential financing options that may be available to us, such as sales of our common stock, including through our at-the-market sales program. Except for the at-the-market sales program, we have no commitments to obtain any additional funds, and there can be no assurance funds will be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms. In addition, the Company agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to effect any issuance of common stock or securities convertible into common stock involving a Variable Rate Transaction, as defined in the Placement Agreement and which includes sales of common stock under the at-the-market sales program, for a period commencing on the date of the Placement Agreement until 180 days following the closing of our June 2024 public offering. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional financing in a timely fashion and on terms acceptable to us, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and we may not be able to continue operations or execute our stated commercialization plan. The consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred net losses of 7,358,943 and used cash in operations of 5,884,842. In light of our cash balance as of September 30, 2024, we will need to raise additional capital in order to fund operations through the next twelve months, and prior to any ability to fund operations from revenue generated from the sale of our products. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Operating Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 5,884,842 of cash in operating activities primarily as a result of our net loss of 7,358,943, offset by share-based compensation of 467,240, amortization of right of use assets of 124,320, inventory reserve of 4,687, depreciation expense of 35,489, fixed assets write-off of 8,808, warrant expense of 7,323,685, change in fair value of warrant liability of (3,341,829), gain on settlement of warrant exercises of (3,071,252), and net in operating assets and liabilities of 77,047. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 7,374,197 of cash in operating activities primarily as a result of our net loss of 8,600,714, offset by share-based compensation of 745,873, depreciation expense of 101,839, amortization of right of use assets of 112,365, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 266,440. Investing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 16,000 in investing activities related to purchases of fixed assets, and received 3,204 in proceeds from sale of fixed assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 27,000 in investing activities related to purchases of fixed assets. Financing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our financing activities provided 1,148,470 in proceeds from issuances of common stock, 5,368,363 in proceeds from issuance of warrants, and 1,320,568 in proceeds from the issuance of cashless warrants. We also used 28,484 to repay a loan from TD Bank under the Canadian Emergency Business Account. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our financing activities provided 5,846,635 in proceeds from issuances of common stock and warrants. 23 Table of Contents Long-Term Liquidity We have not completed the commercialization of any of our TAEUS technology platform applications. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we: advance the engineering design and development of our TAEUS technology; acquire parts and build finished goods inventory of the TAEUS FLIP system; complete regulatory filings required for marketing approval of our NAFLD TAEUS application in the United States, including clinical studies to advance our de novo application with the FDA; seek to hire a small internal marketing team to engage and support channel partners and clinical customers for our NAFLD TAEUS application; expand marketing of our NAFLD TAEUS application; advance development of our other TAEUS applications; and add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development, planned commercialization efforts and our operation as a public company. It is possible that we will not achieve the progress that we expect because the actual costs and timing of completing the development and regulatory approvals for a new medical device are difficult to predict and are subject to substantial risks and delays. We have no committed external sources of funds except for the February 2024 ATM Agreement, the use of which may be limited due to registration statement rules relating to public float. We do not expect that our existing cash will be sufficient for us to complete the commercialization of our NAFLD TAEUS application or to complete the development of any other TAEUS application and we will need to raise substantial additional capital for those purposes. As a result, we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our TAEUS platform applications, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts or perhaps even cease the operation of our business. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or applications or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Off-Balance Sheet Transactions At September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item 3. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, management performed, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We identified the following material weakness as of September 30, 2024: insufficient personnel resources within the accounting function to segregate the duties over financial transaction processing and reporting. 24 Table of Contents To remediate the material weakness, management intends to implement the following measures during 2024, as the Company s resources and financial means allow: Add additional accounting personnel or outside consultants, such as a new controller, to properly segregate duties and to effect timely, accurate preparation of the financial statements; and Continue the development of adequate written accounting policies and procedures. The additional hiring is contingent upon our efforts to obtain additional funding and the results of our operations. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could affect these controls during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are not currently a party to any pending legal proceedings that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. We may, however, be subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business from time to time. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in this section and under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2024. These factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by any forward-looking statements contained in this report.
