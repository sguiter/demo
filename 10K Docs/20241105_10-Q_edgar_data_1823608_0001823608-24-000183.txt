CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to we, us, our and the Company refer to Amalgamated Financial Corp. and Amalgamated Bank. References to the Bank refer to Amalgamated Bank. 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical or current fact nor are they assurances of future performance and generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as may, approximately, will, anticipate, should, would, believe, contemplate, expect, estimate, continue, plan, possible, and intend, or the negative thereof as well as other similar words and expressions of the future. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements related to our projected growth, anticipated future financial performance, and management s long-term performance goals, as well as statements relating to the anticipated effects on results of operations and financial condition from expected developments or events, or business and growth strategies, including anticipated internal growth. 
 Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict as to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in or by such statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 uncertain conditions in the banking industry and in national, regional and local economies in our core markets, which may have an adverse impact on our business, operations and financial performance; 
 deterioration in the financial condition of borrowers resulting in significant increases in credit losses and provisions for those losses; 
 deposit outflows and subsequent declines in liquidity caused by factors that could include lack of confidence in the banking system, a deterioration in market conditions or the financial condition of depositors; 
 changes in our deposits, including an increase in uninsured deposits; 
 our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our deposit and debt obligations as they come due, which may require that we sell investment securities at a loss, negatively impacting our net income, earnings and capital; 
 unfavorable conditions in the capital markets, which may cause declines in our stock price and the value of our investments; 
 negative economic and political conditions that adversely affect the general economy, housing prices, the real estate market, the job market, consumer confidence, the financial condition of our borrowers and consumer spending habits, which may affect, among other things, the level of non-performing assets, charge-offs and provision expense; 
 fluctuations or unanticipated changes in the interest rate environment including changes in net interest margin or changes in the yield curve that affect investments, loans or deposits; 
 the general decline in the real estate and lending markets, particularly in commercial real estate in our market areas, and the effects of the enactment of or changes to rent-control and other similar regulations on multi-family housing; 
 changes in legislation, regulation, public policies, or administrative practices impacting the banking industry, including increased minimum capital requirements and other regulation in the aftermath of recent bank failures; 
 the outcome of legal or regulatory proceedings that may be instituted against us; 
 our inability to achieve organic loan and deposit growth and the composition of that growth; 
 the composition of our loan portfolio, including any concentration in industries or sectors that may experience unanticipated or anticipated adverse conditions greater than other industries or sectors in the national or local economies in which we operate; 
 inaccuracy of the assumptions and estimates we make and policies that we implement in establishing our allowance for credit losses, 
 changes in loan underwriting, credit review or loss reserve policies associated with economic conditions, examination conclusions, or regulatory developments; 
 any matter that would cause us to conclude that there was impairment of any asset, including intangible assets; 
 limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends; 
 the impact of competition with other financial institutions, including pricing pressures and the resulting impact on our results, including as a result of compression to net interest margin; 
 increased competition for experienced members of the workforce including executives in the banking industry; 
 a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches; 
 ii 

increased regulatory scrutiny and exposure from the use of big data techniques, machine learning, and artificial intelligence; 
 downgrade in our credit rating; 
 greenwashing claims against us and our Environmental, Social and Governance ESG products and increased scrutiny and political opposition to ESG and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion DEI practices; 
 any unanticipated or greater than anticipated adverse conditions (including the possibility of earthquakes, wildfires, floods, and other natural disasters) affecting the markets in which we operate; 
 physical and transitional risks related to climate change as they impact our business and the businesses that we finance; 
 future repurchase of our shares through our common stock repurchase program; and 
 descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing. 
 
 We caution readers that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive, is not necessarily in order of importance and readers should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included elsewhere in this report. Additional factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements may be found in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC and available at the SEC s website at https://sec.gov. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we do not intend to and, except as required by law, disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, unless required to do so under the federal securities laws.

 The Company controls and monitors inherent credit risk in its securities portfolio through due diligence, diversification, concentration limits, periodic securities reviews, and by investing in low risk securities. This includes high quality Non-Agency Securities, low loan-to-value ("LTV") PACE assessments and a significant portion of the securities portfolio in GSE obligations. GSEs include the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC ), the Federal National Mortgage Association FNMA ), the Government National Mortgage Association GNMA and the Small Business Administration SBA ). GNMA is a wholly owned U.S. Government corporation whereas FHLMC, FMNA, and SBA are private. Mortgage-related securities may include mortgage pass-through certificates, participation certificates and CMOs. At September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10 of stockholders' equity.

 As discussed in Note 1, upon adoption of the Current Expected Credit Losses ("CECL") standard, allowance for credit losses was recorded on available for sale securities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were charge-offs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company charged-off an unrealized loss position of million related to a corporate bond related to Silicon Valley Bank following credit concerns over the issuer, and the sale of the security resulted in an immaterial additional loss. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, available for sale securities were charged-off. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, none of the Company s available-for-sale debt securities were in an unrealized loss position due to credit quality and therefore no allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities was required. The temporary impairment of fixed income securities is primarily attributable to changes in overall market interest rates and/or changes in credit/liquidity spreads since the investments were acquired. In general, as market interest rates rise and/or credit/liquidity spreads widen, the fair value of fixed rate securities will decrease, as market interest rates fall and/or credit spreads tighten, the fair value of fixed rate securities will increase. 
 
 With respect to the Company s security investments that are temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2024, management does not intend to sell these investments and does not believe it will be necessary to do so before anticipated recovery. If either criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. The Company expects to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of these investments. Therefore, the Company does not hold an allowance for credit losses for available for sale securities at September 30, 2024.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
 Available for sale securities 
 The Company s available for sale securities are reported at fair value. Investments in fixed income securities are generally valued based on evaluations provided by an independent pricing service. These evaluations represent an exit price or their opinion as to what a buyer would pay for a security, typically in an institutional round lot position, in a current sale. The pricing service utilizes evaluated pricing techniques that vary by asset class and incorporate available market information and, because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, applies available information through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of available securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Model processes, such as option adjusted spread models, are used to value securities that have prepayment features. In those limited cases where pricing service evaluations are not available for a fixed income security, management will typically value those instruments using observable market inputs in a discounted cash flow analysis. 
 Derivatives 
 Derivatives represent interest rate option contracts and interest rate swaps and estimated fair values are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis 
 Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. That is, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. Financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include certain individually evaluated loans (or impaired loans prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13) reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.

 Standby letters of credit Total 
 
 Commitments to extend credit are contracts to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. These commitments have fixed expiration dates and other termination clauses and generally require the payment of nonrefundable fees. Since a portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contractual principal amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. These instruments represent ultimate exposure to credit risk only to the extent they are subsequently drawn upon by customers. 
 Standby letters of credit are conditional lending commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the financial performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The balance sheet carrying value of standby letters of credit approximates any nonrefundable fees received but not yet recorded as income. The Company considers this carrying value, which is not material, to approximate the estimated fair value of these financial instruments. 
 The Company reserves for the credit risk inherent in off balance sheet credit commitments. This allowance, which is included in other liabilities, amounted to approximately million as of September 30, 2024, compared to an allowance of million as of December 31, 2023. The recovery of credit losses related to off balance sheet credit commitments was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the provision for credit losses related to off balance sheet commitments was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Investment Obligations 
 
 The Company is a party to agreements with Pace Funding Group LLC, which operates Home Run Financing, for the purchase of PACE assessment securities until January 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had purchased million of these obligations and had an estimated remaining commitment of million. These investments are currently held in the Company's available for sale and held-to-maturity investment portfolio. The Company evaluates these obligations for credit risk and the recorded reserve is immaterial. A commercial PACE transaction was closed in the third quarter that still has periodic funding over the next year. 
 Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 In the ordinary course of business, there are various legal proceedings pending against the Company. Based on the opinion of counsel, management believes that the aggregate liabilities, if any, arising from such actions would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company. As part of the Company's ongoing investments in Variable Interest Entities projects, we also have commitments to provide financing, which are included in Note 13.

 Critical and Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Other than the addition of accounting policies related to derivatives, there have been no significant changes to our significant accounting policies, or the estimates made pursuant to those policies as described in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Management has identified accounting policies that, due to the estimates, assumptions and judgments inherent in those policies, are critical in understanding our financial statements. Management has presented the application of these policies to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
 
 Allowance for credit losses on loans 
 
 Methods and Assumptions Underlying the Estimate 
 
 On January 1, 2023, we adopted the CECL Standard, which requires that loans held for investment be accounted for under the current expected credit losses model. The allowance for credit losses is established and maintained through a provision for credit losses based on expected losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis, and additions to the allowance are charged to expense and subsequent changes (favorable and unfavorable) in expected credit losses are recognized immediately in net income as a credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed, expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. 
 
 Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In determining the allowance for credit losses for loans that share similar risk characteristics, the Company utilizes a model which compares the amortized cost basis of the loan to the net present value of expected cash flows to be collected. Expected credit losses are determined by aggregating the individual cash flows and calculating a loss percentage by loan segment for loans that share similar risk characteristics. For a loan that does not share risk characteristics with other loans, the Company will evaluate the loan on an individual basis. Within the model, assumptions are made in the determination of baseline loss rates, severity rates, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, and prepayment rates. 
 
 The Company assesses the sensitivity of key assumptions at least annually by stressing the assumptions to understand the impact on the model. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control which are inherently difficult to predict, the most significant being the macroeconomic forecasts. The Company's forecast of economic conditions considers baseline, favorable, and adverse scenarios. As economic conditions can change, the anticipated amount of estimated loan defaults and losses, and therefore the adequacy of the allowance, could change significantly. Economic conditions more favorable than forecasted could lead to reductions in the amount of the allowance, and conversely conditions more adverse than forecasted could require increases in the amount of the allowance. Changes in economic forecasts may not occur in the same direction or magnitude across all segments of our loan portfolio and deterioration in some quantitative inputs may offset improvement in others. The Company selects the economic forecast that is most reflective of expectations at that point in time, and changes could significantly impact the calculated estimated credit losses. 
 
 For segments that rely on a peer group to develop baseline loss rates, statistical regression is utilized to relate historical macro-economic variables to historical credit loss experience of a peer group of banks. These models are then utilized to forecast future expected credit losses based on expected future behavior of the same macro-economic variables. Adjustments to the quantitative results are made using qualitative factors. These factors include: (1) borrowers' financial condition; (2) borrowers' ability to pay; (3) nature and volume of financial assets; (4) value of the underlying collateral; (5) lending policies and procedures; (6) quality of 
 48 

the loan review system; (7) the experience, ability, and depth of staff; (8) regulatory and legal environment; (9) changes in market conditions; and (10) changes in economic conditions. 
 
 For loans that do not share risk characteristics, the Company evaluates these loans on an individual basis based on various factors. Factors that may be considered are borrowers delinquency trends and nonaccrual status, probability of foreclosure or note sale, changes in the borrowers' circumstances or cash collections, borrowers' industry, or other facts and circumstances of the loan or collateral. The expected credit loss is measured based on net realizable value, that is, the difference between the discounted value of the expected future cash flows, based on the original effective interest rate, and the amortized cost basis of the loan. For collateral dependent loans, expected credit loss is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and the fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell. 
 
 Uncertainties Regarding the Estimate 
 
 Estimating the timing and amounts of future losses is subject to significant management judgment as these projected cash flows rely upon the estimates discussed within the Allowance for Credit Losses policy and factors that are reflective of current or future expected conditions. These estimates depend on the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry, borrowers, or portfolio specific conditions. Volatility in certain credit metrics and differences between expected and actual outcomes are to be expected. 
 
 Customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. Bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan charge-offs. 
 
 Impact on Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover expected losses in the loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic, market or other conditions. Changes in estimates could result in a material change in the allowance through charges to earnings and could materially decrease our net income. 
 
 We may experience significant credit losses if borrowers' experience financial difficulties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 
 
 In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the examination process, periodically review the allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of the information available to them at the time of their examination.

Results of Operations 
 
 General 
 
 Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of interest income on loans, investment securities and other short-term investments and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of interest expense for deposits and borrowings. Our results of operations are also dependent on non-interest income, consisting primarily of income from Trust Department fees, service charges on deposit accounts, net gains on sales of investment securities and income from bank-owned life insurance BOLI ). Other factors contributing to our results of operations include our provisions for credit losses, income taxes, and non-interest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and depreciation expenses, professional fees, data processing fees and other miscellaneous operating costs. 
 
 Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 27.9 million , or 0.90 per diluted share, compared to 22.3 million , or 0.73 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. The 5.6 million increase was primarily due to a 6.5 million increase in interest income on securities, a 4.5 million increase in interest income on loans, a 2.2 million increase in non-interest income, and a 0.6 million increase in interest on interest-bearing deposits in banks, offset by a 3.2 million increase in interest expense primarily related to a 6.9 million increase in deposits offset by a 3.7 million decrease in borrowed funds, an increase in non-interest expense of 3.6 million, and a 1.4 million increase in income tax expense. 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 81.9 million, or 2.65 per diluted share, compared to 65.3 million, or 2.12 per diluted share, for the same period in 2023. The 16.6 million increase was primarily due to a 17.7 increase in interest income on loans, a 14.8 million increase in interest income on securities, a 8.5 million increase in non-interest income primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposit accounts, a 4.3 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, and a 4.2 million increase in interest income from interest-bearing deposits in banks, offset by a 21.3 million increase in interest expense, 6.4 million increase in income tax expense, and a 5.1 million increase in non-interest expense. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income, representing interest income less interest expense, is a significant contributor to our revenues and earnings. We generate interest income from interest, dividends and prepayment fees on interest-earning assets, including loans, investment securities and other short-term investments. We incur interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including interest-bearing deposits, subordinated debt, Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLBNY") advances, federal funds purchased and other borrowings. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (i) yields on our loans, investments, and other interest-earning assets, (ii) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, (iii) our net interest spread and (iv) our net interest margin. Net interest spread is equal to the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is equal to the annualized net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and stockholders equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing sources. 
 
 Changes in the market interest rates and interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income.

 (1) Includes FHLBNY stock in the average balance, and dividend income on FHLBNY stock in interest income. 
 (2) Includes prepayment penalty income in 3Q2024 and 3Q2023 of 0 and 0 thousand, respectively. 
 
 Net interest income was 72.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 63.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. The 8.4 million increase, or 13.2 increase from the third quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to higher yields on and average balances in interest-earning assets coupled with lower average balances in interest-bearing liabilities and higher average balances in demand and transaction deposits, partially offset by higher costs. 
 
 Net interest spread was 1.90 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.20 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 30 basis points. Our net interest margin was 3.51 for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 22 basis points from 3.29 in the third quarter of 2023. This was largely due to increases in yields and average balances on interest-bearing assets, offset by increases in cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities. 
 
 51 

The yield on average earning assets was 5.01 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.70 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 31 basis points. This increase was driven primarily by the current rate environment resulting in increased yields across securities and loan portfolios. 
 
 The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities was 3.11 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 61 basis points from the same period in 2023, which was primarily due to the rising rate environment that led to an increase in interest expense paid for deposits, particularly in savings, NOW, money market deposits and time deposits. Non-interest-bearing deposits represented 49.1 of average deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 42.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 (1) Includes FHLBNY stock in the average balance, and dividend income on FHLBNY stock in interest income. 
 (2) Includes prepayment penalty interest income in September YTD 2024 and September YTD 2023 of 18 and 0 thousand, respectively. 
 
 Net interest income was 209.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 194.0 million for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year increase of 15.3 million, or 7.9 , was primarily attributable to higher yields and average balances on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher costs. 
 
 Our net interest spread was 2.08 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.41 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 33 basis points. Our net interest margin was 3.48 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an 
 53 

increase of 8 basis points from 3.40 in the same period of 2023. This was largely due to increases in yields on interest-bearing assets, offset by increases in cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities. 
 
 The yield on average earning assets was 4.97 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.60 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 37 basis points. This increase was driven primarily by the current rate environment resulting in increased yields across securities and loan portfolios. 
 
 The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities was 2.89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 70 basis points from the same period in 2023, which was primarily due to the rising rate environment that led to an increase in interest expense paid for deposits. Non-interest-bearing deposits represented 46.2 of average deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 44.9 for the same period in 2023. 

Rate-Volume Analysis 
 Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in weighted average interest rates. The table below presents the effect of volume and rate changes on interest income and expense. Changes in volume are changes in the average balance multiplied by the previous period s average rate. Changes in rate are changes in the average rate multiplied by the average balance from the previous period. The net changes attributable to the combined impact of both rate and volume have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate:

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 On January 1, 2023, we adopted the CECL standard for calculating the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses. We establish an allowance for credit losses through a provision for credit losses charged as an expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. For further discussion of the methodology under the CECL standard, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 54 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Provision for credit losses totaled an expense of 1.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to an expense of 2.0 million for the same period in 2023. The provision for credit losses on loans totaled an expense of 4.9 million, the provision for credit losses on securities was a recovery of 18 thousand, and the provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was a recovery of 3.0 million. Overall, the provision expense on loans was primarily driven by charge-offs on our consumer solar and small business portfolios and updates to CECL model assumptions, offset by decreases in reserves for unfunded commitments. During the third quarter of 2024, the consumer solar loss rate assumption was refreshed given the level of continued losses, which increased the segment coverage ratio and resulted in higher required reserves. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Our provision for credit losses totaled an expense of 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an expense of 10.9 million for the same period in 2023. The provision for credit losses on loans totaled 7.6 million, the provision for credit losses on securities was a recovery of 31 thousand, and the provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was a recovery of 0.9 million. Overall, the provision expense on loans was primarily driven by increases in charge-offs on our consumer solar and small business portfolios, an increase in reserve for multifamily loans to reflect the current market repricing conditions, and updates to CECL model assumptions, offset by improvements in macro-economic forecasts used in the CECL model, and decreases in reserves for unfunded commitments. During the third quarter of 2024, the consumer solar loss rate assumption was refreshed given the level of continued losses, which increased the segment coverage ratio and resulted in higher required reserves. 
 For a further discussion of the allowance, see Allowance for Credit Losses below. 
 Non-Interest Income 
 Our non-interest income includes Trust Department fees, which consist of fees received in connection with investment advisory and custodial management services of investment accounts, service fees charged on deposit accounts, income on BOLI, gain or loss on sales of securities, gain or loss on sales of loans, changes in fair value on loans held-for-sale, income or losses from equity method investments, and other income. 
 The following table presents our non-interest income for the periods indicated:

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Non-interest income was 8.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 6.8 million for the third quarter in 2023. The increase of 2.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the corresponding quarter in 2023 was primarily due to a 9.4 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts primarily due to increases in ICS One-Way Sell income, partially offset by a 4.2 million increase in losses on sale of loans and changes in fair value on loans held-for-sale and a 1.5 million increase in losses on sale of securities, and a decrease in income from equity investments of 1.4 million. Our Trust Department fees were 3.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, and 3.7 million in the same period in 2023 .

 Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 41.0 million, an increase of 3.6 million from 37.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by a 2.4 million increase in compensation and benefits expense related to an expected increase in compensation due to increased headcount and corporate incentive payments, and a 0.5 million increase in data processing, a 0.4 million increase in other expenses, a 0.4 million increase in professional fees and a 0.2 million increase in advertising and promotion expense.

 Non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 118.6 million, an increase of 5.1 million from 113.5 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by a 4.6 million increase in compensation and benefits expense related to an expected increase in compensation due to increased headcount, corporate incentive payments, and temporary personnel costs, and a 1.3 million increase in data processing expense. This was partially offset by a 0.5 million decrease in occupancy and depreciation expense due to a gain from settlement of a lease termination, a 0.2 million decrease in office maintenance and depreciation expense, and a 0.1 million increase in professional fees.

Financial Condition 
 
 Balance Sheet 
 
 Our total assets were 8.41 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 7.97 billion at December 31, 2023. Notable changes within individual balance sheet line items include a 582.6 million increase in deposits, a 199.0 million increase in securities, a 58.6 million increase in cash, a 24.9 million increase in resell agreements, a 140.8 million increase in loans receivable, net, and a 236.5 million decrease in borrowings. 
 Investment Securities 
 
 The primary goal of our securities portfolio is to maintain an available source of liquidity and an efficient investment return on excess capital, while maintaining a low-risk profile. We also use our securities portfolio to manage interest rate risk, meet Community Reinvestment Act CRA goals, support the Company's mission, and to provide collateral for certain types of deposits or borrowings. An Investment Committee chaired by our Chief Financial Officer manages our investment securities portfolio according to written investment policies approved by our Board of Directors. Investments in our securities portfolio may change over time based on management s objectives and market conditions. 
 
 We seek to minimize credit risk in our securities portfolio through diversification, concentration limits, restrictions on high risk investments (such as subordinated positions), comprehensive pre-purchase analysis and stress testing, ongoing monitoring and by investing a significant portion of our securities portfolio in U.S. GSE obligations. GSEs include the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC ), the Federal National Mortgage Association FNMA ), the Government National Mortgage Association GNMA and the Small Business Administration SBA ). GNMA is a wholly-owned U.S. Government corporation whereas FHLMC and FNMA are private. Mortgage-related securities may include mortgage pass-through certificates, participation certificates and CMOs. We invest in non-GSE securities, including property assessed clean energy ("PACE") assessments, in order to generate higher returns, improve portfolio diversification and reduce interest rate and prepayment risk. With the exception of small legacy CRA investments, Trust Preferred securities, and certain corporate bonds, all of our non-GSE securities are senior positions that are the top of the capital structure. 
 
 Our investment securities portfolio consists of securities classified as available for sale and held-to-maturity. There were no trading securities in our investment portfolio at September 30, 2024 or at December 31, 2023. All available for sale securities are carried at fair value and may be used for liquidity purposes should management consider it to be in our best interest. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had available for sale securities of 1.77 billion and 1.48 billion, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024, our held-to-maturity securities portfolio primarily consisted of PACE assessments, tax-exempt municipal securities, GSE commercial and residential certificates and other debt. We carry these securities at amortized cost. We had held-to-maturity securities of 1.61 billion at September 30, 2024, and 1.70 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we purchased a total of 793.4 million securities consisting of both available for sale and held-to-maturity and sold available for sale securities resulting in proceeds of 271.0 million and a net realized loss of 8.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we purchased a total of 280.6 million securities consisting of both available for sale and held-to-maturity and sold available for sale securities resulting in proceeds of 250.0 million and a net realized loss of 5.1 million. 
 Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities on a collective basis by major security type. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity debt securities totaled 17.8 million at September 30, 2024 and 22.5 million at December 31, 2023, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses, as accrued interest receivable is reversed for securities placed on nonaccrual status. The allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity securities at September 30, 2024 was 0.7 million compared to 0.7 million at December 31, 2023. The provision for credit losses for held-to-maturity securities was a 
 57 

recovery of 18.0 thousand and 31.0 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an expense of 18 thousand and 83 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For debt securities available-for-sale that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that an expected credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as credit loss expense (or recovery). Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. 
 Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities totaled 14.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 12.6 million at December 31, 2023, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses, as accrued interest receivable is reversed for securities placed on nonaccrual status.

 Nonperforming Assets 
 Nonperforming assets include all loans categorized as nonaccrual, other real estate owned and other repossessed assets. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued, or the loan is placed on nonaccrual, when the full collection of principal and interest is in doubt. Interest on loans is generally recognized on the accrual basis. Interest is not accrued on loans that are more than 90 days delinquent on payments, and any interest that was accrued but unpaid on such loans is reversed from interest income at that time, or when deemed to be uncollectible. Interest subsequently received on such loans is recorded as interest income or alternatively as 
 65 

a reduction in the amortized cost of the loan if there is significant doubt as to the collectability of the unpaid principal balance. Loans are returned to accrual status when principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. 
 The following table sets forth our nonperforming assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 (In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Loans 90 days past due and accruing Nonaccrual loans held for sale 989 989 Nonaccrual loans - Commercial 17,108 23,189 Nonaccrual loans - Retail 10,542 9,994 Nonaccrual securities 8 31 Total nonperforming assets 28,647 34,203 Nonaccrual loans: Commercial and industrial 1,849 7,533 Multifamily Commercial real estate 4,146 4,490 Construction and land development 11,113 11,166 Total commercial portfolio 17,108 23,189 Residential real estate lending 7,578 7,218 Consumer solar 2,848 2,673 Consumer and other 116 103 Total retail portfolio 10,542 9,994 Total nonaccrual loans 27,650 33,183 Nonperforming assets to total assets 0.34 0.43 Nonaccrual assets to total assets 0.34 0.43 Nonaccrual loans to total loans 0.61 0.75 Allowance for credit losses on loans to nonaccrual loans 222.30 197.97 Allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans 1.35 1.49 Annualized net charge-offs to average loans 
 0.61 0.33 
 
 Nonperforming assets totaled 28.6 million, or 0.34 of period-end total assets at September 30, 2024, an decrease of 5.6 million, compared with 34.2 million, or 0.43 of period-end total assets at December 31, 2023. The decrease in non-performing assets at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 assets was primarily driven by a 6.1 million decrease in commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans offset by a 0.5 million increase in retail nonaccrual loans. 
 Potential problem loans are loans which management has doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms. Potential problem loans are performing loans and include our special mention and substandard-accruing commercial loans and/or retail loans 30-89 days past due. Potential problem loans are not included in the nonperforming assets table above and totaled 82.1 million, or 1.0 of total assets, at September 30, 2024, as follows: 71.7 million are commercial loans currently in workout that management expects will be rehabilitated; 5.4 million are residential real estate loans at 30-89 days delinquent, and 5.0 million are consumer loans at 30-89 days delinquent. 
 Resell Agreements 
 As of September 30, 2024, w e have entered into 74.9 million of short term investments of resell agreements backed by residential first-lien mortgage loans, with a weighted average interest rate of 6.34 . As of December 31, 2023 , w e have entered 
 66 

into 50.0 million of short term investments of resell agreements backed by residential first-lien mortgage loans, with a weighted interest rate of 6.34 . 
 
 Deferred Tax Asset 
 We had a deferred tax asset, net of deferred tax liabilities, of 38.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 56.6 million at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our deferred tax assets were fully realizable with no valuation allowance held against the balance. Our management concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the entire amount will be realized. 
 We will evaluate the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset on a periodic basis and record decreases (increases) as a deferred tax provision (benefit) in the Consolidated Statements of Income as appropriate. 
 
 Deposits 
 Deposits represent our primary source of funds. We are focused on growing our core deposits through relationship-based banking with our business and consumer clients. Total deposits were 7.59 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 7.01 billion at December 31, 2023. We believe that our strong deposit franchise is attributable to our mission-based strategy of developing and maintaining relationships with our clients who share similar values and through maintaining a high level of service. 
 We gather deposits through each of our three branch locations across New York City, our one branch in Washington, D.C., our one branch in San Francisco and through the efforts of our commercial banking team including our Boston group which focuses nationally on business growth. Through our branch network, online, mobile and direct banking channels, we offer a variety of deposit products including demand deposit accounts, money market deposits, NOW accounts, savings and certificates of deposit, Insured Cash Sweep accounts, Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service accounts, and brokered certificates of deposit. We bank politically active customers, such as campaigns, PACs ("political action committees"), and state and national party committees, which we refer to as political deposits. These deposits exhibit seasonality based on election cycles. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had approximately 1.96 billion and 1.19 billion, respectively, in political deposits on- and off-balance sheet which are primarily in demand deposits. 
 Additionally, we utilize a custodial deposit transference structure through the IntraFi ICS ("Insured Cash Sweep") network for certain deposit programs whereby we, acting as custodian of account holder funds, place a portion of such account holder funds that are not needed to support near term settlement at one or more third-party banks insured by the FDIC (each, a "Program Bank"). Accounts opened at Program Banks are established in our name as custodian, for the benefit of our account holders. We remain the issuer of all accounts under the applicable account holder agreements and have sole custodial control and transaction authority over the accounts opened at Program Banks. We maintain the records of each account holder's deposits maintained at Program Banks. These off-balance sheet deposits totaled 1.18 billion at September 30, 2024 and 303.1 million at December 31, 2023. In return for record keeping services at Program Banks, the Company receives a servicing fee. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized 8.1 million and 16.9 million in servicing fee income. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized 0.8 thousand and 0.8 thousand in servicing fee income, respectively. 
 Total estimated uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 4.52 billion and 4.04 billion, respectively. 
 Maturities of time certificates of deposit and other time deposits of 250,000 or more outstanding at September 30, 2024 are summarized as follows: 
 Maturities as of September 30, 2024 (In thousands) Within three months 22,269 After three but within six months 7,434 After six months but within twelve months 11,206 After twelve months 3,098 44,007

Evaluation of Interest Rate Risk 
 Our simulation models incorporate various assumptions, which we believe are reasonable but which may have a significant impact on results such as: (1) the timing of changes in interest rates, (2) shifts or rotations in the yield curve, (3) loan and securities prepayment speeds for different interest rate scenarios, (4) interest rates and balances of indeterminate-maturity deposits for different scenarios, and (5) new volume and yield assumptions for loans, securities and deposits. Because of limitations inherent in any approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on our results but rather to better plan and execute appropriate asset-liability management strategies and manage our interest rate risk. 
 In accordance with the Company's policies, the Company may enter into derivative transactions to hedge against interest rate risk. The impact of existing derivative contracts are included in the simulation analysis below. 
 Potential changes to our net interest income and economic value of equity in hypothetical rising and declining rate scenarios calculated as of September 30, 2024 are presented in the following table. The projections assume immediate, parallel shifts downward of the yield curve of 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points and immediate, parallel shifts upward of the yield curve of 100, 200 and 300 basis points. 
 The results of this simulation analysis are hypothetical and should not be relied on as indicative of expected operating results. A variety of factors might cause actual results to differ substantially from what is depicted. For example, if the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes differ from those projected, our net interest income might vary significantly. Non-parallel yield curve shifts such as a flattening or steepening of the yield curve or changes in interest rate spreads, would also cause our net interest income to be different from that depicted. An increasing interest rate environment could reduce projected net interest income if deposits and other short-term liabilities re-price faster than expected or faster than our assets re-price. Actual results could differ from those projected if we grow assets and liabilities faster or slower than estimated, if we experience a net outflow of deposit liabilities or if our mix of assets and liabilities otherwise changes. Actual results could also differ from those projected if we experience substantially different repayment speeds in our loan portfolio than those assumed in the simulation model. Finally, these simulation results do not contemplate all the actions that we may undertake in response to potential or actual changes in interest rates, such as changes to our loan, investment, deposit, funding or hedging strategies.

 Liquidity 
 Liquidity refers to our ability to maintain cash flow that is adequate to fund our operations, support asset growth, maintain reserve requirements and meet present and future obligations of deposit withdrawals, lending obligations and other contractual obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or by obtaining additional funding through liability management. Our liquidity risk management policy provides the framework that we use to maintain adequate liquidity and sources of available liquidity at levels that enable us to meet all reasonably foreseeable short-term, long-term and strategic liquidity demands. The Asset and Liability Management Committee is responsible for oversight of liquidity risk management activities in accordance with the provisions of our liquidity risk policy and applicable bank regulatory capital and liquidity laws and regulations. Our liquidity risk management process includes (i) ongoing analysis and monitoring of our funding requirements under various balance sheet and economic scenarios, (ii) review and monitoring of lenders, depositors, brokers and other liability holders to ensure appropriate diversification of funding sources and (iii) liquidity contingency planning to address liquidity needs in the event of unforeseen market disruption impacting a wide range of variables. We continuously monitor our liquidity position in 
 68 

order for our assets and liabilities to be managed in a manner that will meet our immediate and long-term funding requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our stockholders. We also monitor our liquidity requirements in light of interest rate trends, changes in the economy, and the scheduled maturity and interest rate sensitivity of our securities and loan portfolios and deposits. The complexity of liquidity management increases due to the varying levels of management control that can be exerted over different elements of the balance sheet. For example, the timing of maturities of our investment portfolio is fairly predictable and subject to a high degree of control when we make investment decisions. Net deposit inflows and outflows, however, are far less predictable and are not subject to the same degree of certainty. 
 In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, we monitor the parent company s liquidity. The parent company s routine funding requirements consist primarily of operating expenses, dividends paid to shareholders, debt service, repurchases of common stock and funds used for acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and the issuance of debt and capital securities. Dividend payments to the parent company by its subsidiary bank are subject to regulatory review and statutory limitations and, in some instances, regulatory approval. The Company maintains sufficient funding to meet expected capital and debt service obligations for 24 months without the support of dividends from subsidiaries and assuming access to the wholesale markets is maintained. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its capital and debt service obligations for 12 months under adverse conditions without the support of dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale markets. 
 Our liquidity position is supported by management of our liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily to fund on-going operations, including payment of interest on deposits and debt, extensions of credit to borrowers and capital expenditures. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through our deposits, FHLBNY advances and the principal and interest payments we receive on loans and investment securities. Cash, interest-bearing deposits in third-party banks, securities available for sale and maturing or prepaying balances in our investment and loan portfolios are our most liquid assets. Other sources of liquidity that are available to us include the sale of loans we hold for investment, securitization of loans or PACE assessments, the ability to acquire additional national market non-core deposits, borrowings through the Federal Reserve s discount window and the issuance of debt or equity securities. We believe that the sources of available liquidity are adequate to meet our current and reasonably foreseeable future liquidity needs. 
 At September 30, 2024, our cash and equivalents, which consist of cash and amounts due from banks and interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, amounted to 149.2 million, or 1.8 of total assets, compared to 90.6 million, or 1.1 of total assets at December 31, 2023. The 58.6 million, or 64.7 , increase is due to normal business activity, paydowns of borrowings, and strategic investment securities purchases, offset by investments in resell agreements. Our available for sale securities at September 30, 2024 were 1.77 billion, or 21.0 of total assets, compared to 1.48 billion, or 18.6 of total assets at December 31, 2023. Investment securities with an aggregate fair value of 1.21 billion at September 30, 2024 were pledged to secure outstanding advances, letters of credit, provide additional borrowing potential, and collateralize municipal deposits. Additionally, mortgage loans with an unpaid principal balance of 2.45 billion and 2.35 billion respectively, were pledged to the FHLBNY to secure outstanding advances, letters of credit and to provide additional borrowing potential. 
 The liability portion of the balance sheet serves as our primary source of liquidity. Over the long term, we plan to meet our future cash needs through the generation of deposits. Customer deposits have historically provided a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. We are also a member of the FHLBNY, from which we can borrow for leverage or liquidity purposes. The FHLBNY requires that securities and qualifying loans be pledged to secure any advances. At September 30, 2024, we had 4.8 million advances from the FHLBNY and a remaining credit availability of 2.11 billion. In addition, we maintain borrowing capacity of approximately 981.9 million with the Federal Reserve s discount window that is secured by certain securities from our portfolio which are not pledged for othe r purposes. 
 We also had 63.7 million in subordinated debt, net of issuance costs. Our cash, off-balance sheet deposits, and borrowing capacity totaled 4.42 billion of immediately available funds, in addition to unpledged securities with two-day availability of 423.0 million for total liquidity within two-days of 4.84 billion , which provided coverage for 107 of total uninsured deposits. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 Total stockholders equity at September 30, 2024 was 698.3 million, compared to 585.4 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 113.0 million. The increase was primarily driven by 81.9 million of net income and a 39.3 million improvement in 
 69 

accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the tax effected mark-to-market on our securities portfolio, offset by 10.6 million in dividends paid at 0.36 per outstanding share, and 0.3 million of common stock repurchases. 
 We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by federal banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. 
 
 Basel III rules impose minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The Basel III rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with consolidated assets of more than 3 billion. In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain the fully phased in capital conservation buffer of 2.5 on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation is equal to 2.5 of risk-weighted assets.

Investment Obligations 
 The Company is party to agreements with Pace Funding Group LLC, which operates Home Run Financing, for the purchase of PACE assessments until the end of January 2025. These investments are to be held in the Company's available for sale and held-to-maturity investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had purchased 812.4 million of these obligations and had an estimated remaining commitment of 60.9 million. The PACE assessments have equal-lien priority with property taxes and generally rank senior to first lien mortgages. The Company anticipates these commitments will be funded by means of normal cash flows, a reduction in cash and cash equivalents, or by pay-downs and maturities of loans and other investments.
