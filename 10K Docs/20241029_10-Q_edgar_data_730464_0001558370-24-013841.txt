Other : Other revenue consists of housing and other miscellaneous services. Other revenue is recognized over the period in which the applicable performance obligation is satisfied. Arrangements for payment are agreed to prior to registration of the student s first academic term. The majority of U.S. students obtain Title IV or other financial aid resulting in institutions receiving a significant amount of the transaction price at the beginning of the academic term. Students not utilizing Title IV or other financial aid funding may pay after the academic term is complete.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and the amount within noncurrent liabilities is million and million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The noncurrent contract liability associated with these material rights is expected to be earned over approximately the next four fiscal years. Upon withdrawal, a student may be eligible to receive a refund, or partial refund, the amount of which is dependent on the timing of the withdrawal during the academic term. If a student withdraws prior to completing an academic term, federal and state regulations and accreditation criteria permit Adtalem to retain a set percentage of the total tuition received from such student, which varies with, but generally equals or exceeds, the percentage of the academic term completed by such student. Payment amounts received by Adtalem in excess of such set percentages of tuition are refunded to the student or the appropriate funding source. For contracts with similar characteristics and historical data on refunds, the expected value method is applied in determining the variable consideration related to refunds. Estimates of Adtalem s expected refunds are determined at the outset of each academic term, based upon actual refunds in previous academic terms. Reserves related to refunds are presented as refund liabilities within accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All refunds are netted against revenue during the applicable academic term. Management reassesses collectability on a student-by-student basis throughout the period revenue is recognized. This reassessment is based upon new information and changes in facts and circumstances relevant to a student s ability to pay. Management also reassesses collectability when a student withdraws from the institution and has unpaid tuition charges. Such unpaid charges do not meet the threshold of reasonably collectible and are recognized as revenue on a cash basis. Contract Balances Students are billed at the beginning of each academic term and payment is due at that time. Adtalem s performance obligation is to provide educational services in the form of instruction during the academic term and to provide for any scholarships or discounts that are deemed a material right under ASC 606. As instruction is provided or the deferred value of material rights are redeemed, deferred revenue is reduced. A significant portion of student payments are from Title IV financial aid and other programs and are generally received during the first month of the respective academic term. For students utilizing Adtalem s credit extension programs (see Note 9 Accounts and Financing Receivables ), payments are generally received after the academic term, and the corresponding performance obligation, is complete. When payments are received, accounts and financing receivables are reduced. Deferred revenue within current liabilities is million and million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and deferred revenue within noncurrent liabilities is million and million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Revenue of million and million was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of fiscal year 2025 and 2024, respectively. The difference between the opening and closing balances of deferred revenue includes decreases from revenue recognized during the period, increases from charges related to the start of academic terms beginning during the period,

 and in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the prior year period primarily due to an increase in the percentage of earnings from operations in higher taxed jurisdictions and a limitation of tax benefits on certain executive compensation. The income tax provisions reflect the U.S. federal tax rate of adjusted for taxes related to global intangible low-taxed income GILTI ), limitation of tax benefits on certain executive compensation, the rate of tax applied by state and local jurisdictions, the rate of tax applied to earnings outside the U.S., tax incentives, tax credits related to research and development expenditures, changes in valuation allowance, liabilities for uncertain tax positions, and tax benefits on stock-based compensation.

June 30, 2024 Gross Allowance Net Accounts receivables, current ) Financing receivables, current ) Accounts and financing receivables, current ) Financing receivables, current ) Financing receivables, noncurrent ) Total financing receivables ) Our financing receivables relate to credit extension programs available to students at Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM. These credit extension programs are designed to assist students who are unable to completely cover educational costs consisting of tuition, fees, and books, and are available only after all other student financial assistance has been applied toward those purposes. In addition, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM allow students to finance their living expenses. Repayment plans for financing agreements are developed to address the financial circumstances of the particular student. Interest charges at rates from to per annum accrue each month on the unpaid balance once a student withdraws or graduates from a program. Most students are required to begin repaying their loans while they are still in school with a minimum payment level designed to demonstrate their capability to repay. Payments may increase upon completing or departing school. After a student leaves school, the student typically will have a monthly installment repayment plan. Credit Quality The primary credit quality indicator for our financing receivables is delinquency. Balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become past due. We write-off financing receivable balances when they are at least 181 days past due. Payments are applied first to outstanding interest and then to the unpaid principal balance. 31-60 days past due 61-90 days past due 91-120 days past due 121-150 days past due Greater than 150 days past due Total past due Current Financing receivables, gross Gross write-offs

In evaluating the collectability of our accounts and financing receivable balances, we utilize historical events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. For our accounts receivables, we primarily use historical loss rates based on an aging schedule and a student s status to determine the allowance for credit losses. As these accounts receivables are short-term in nature, management believes a student s status provides the best credit loss estimate, while also factoring in delinquency. Students still attending classes, recently graduated, or current on payments are more likely to pay than those who are inactive due to being on a leave of absence, withdrawing from school, or not current on payments. For our financing receivables, we primarily use historical loss rates based on an aging schedule. As these financing receivables are based on long-term financing agreements offered by Adtalem, management believes that delinquency provides the best credit loss estimate. As the financing receivable balances become further past due, it is less likely we will receive payment, causing our estimate of credit losses to increase.

 Buildings and improvements - Leasehold improvements Shorter of asset useful life or lease term Furniture and equipment - Software - Construction in progress - Property and equipment, gross Accumulated depreciation ) ) Property and equipment, net During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, management committed to a plan to sell a building owned by Adtalem located in Naperville, Illinois, and the building met criteria to be classified as assets held for sale. As a result, the building s carrying value of million was adjusted to its estimated fair value less cost to sell of million, and the resulting million charge was recognized within student services and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended December 31, 2023. In addition, the building is presented as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. for a fee or the leases for an additional period. The lease term includes the noncancelable period of the lease, as well as any periods for which we are reasonably certain to exercise extension options. We elected to account for lease and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance costs) as a single lease component for all operating leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have not entered into any financing leases. Operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the lease term. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease assets are adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease payments, lease incentives, initial direct costs, and impairments. Our incremental borrowing rate is utilized in determining the present value of the lease payments based upon the information available at the commencement date. Our incremental borrowing rate is determined using a secured borrowing rate for the same currency and term as the associated lease. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As of September 30, 2024, we entered into additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. The first lease is expected to commence during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, has a lease term, and will result in an additional operating lease asset and operating lease liability of approximately million. The second lease is also expected to commence during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, has a lease term, and will result in an additional operating lease asset and operating lease liability of approximately million.

Student relationships was fully amortized as of June 30, 2024. Indefinite-lived intangible assets related to trade names and Title IV eligibility and accreditations are not amortized, as there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, economic, or other factors that limit the useful life of these intangible assets to the reporting entity. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is May 31. Adtalem has reporting units that contain goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. These reporting units constitute components for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. We have the option to assess goodwill for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is determined that the reporting unit fair value is more likely than not less than its carrying value, or if we do not elect the option to perform an initial qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment of the reporting unit s fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit containing the goodwill exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and its fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. We also have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by determining whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If it is determined that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not impaired, or if we do not elect the option to perform an initial qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds fair value. After analyzing the results of operations and business conditions of all reporting units, we determined that no triggering event had occurred that would indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit had exceeded its fair value as of September 30, 2024. These interim triggering event conclusions were based on the fact that the annual impairment review of Adtalem s reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in impairments as of the end of fiscal year 2024, and that no interim events or deviations from planned operating results occurred as of September 30, 2024 that would cause management to reassess these conclusions. If economic conditions deteriorate or operating performance of our reporting units do not meet expectations such that we revise our long-term forecasts, we may recognize impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods.

Excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets, litigation reserve, and debt modification costs, student services and administrative expense increased 11.2 , or 18.6 million, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in marketing expense and investments to support growth initiatives. As a percentage of revenue, student services and administrative expense was 38.1 and 45.0 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease in the percentage was primarily the result of a decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets and litigation reserve. Restructuring Expense Restructuring expense was 2.1 million and 0.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and 2024, respectively. This increase was primarily driven by workforce reductions, costs to exit certain course offerings, and prior real estate consolidations at Adtalem s home office in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. We continue to incur restructuring charges or reversals related to exited leased space from previous restructuring activities. Business Integration Expense Business integration expense was 5.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. We did not incur business integration expense during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. In the prior year, we incurred costs associated with integrating Walden into Adtalem. In addition, we initiated transformation initiatives to accelerate growth and organizational agility, and certain costs relating to the transformation were included in business integration expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The operating income increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was primarily driven by an increase in revenue and decreases in business integration expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and litigation reserve, partially offset by increases in labor and other costs to support increased enrollment, marketing expense, investments to support growth initiatives, and provision for bad debts. The decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets is driven by the decrease in amortization relating to the Walden student relationships intangible asset, which was fully amortized as of June 30, 2024. Consolidated adjusted operating income increased 19.8 , or 12.5 million, to 75.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the prior year period. The adjusted operating income increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was primarily driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by increases in labor and other costs to support increased enrollment, marketing expense, investments to support growth initiatives, and provision for bad debts.

 Chamberlain Chamberlain operating income increased 6.8 , or 1.7 million, to 26.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the prior year period. Segment adjusted operating income increased 14.4 , or 3.5 million, to 27.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the prior year period. The adjusted operating income increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was primarily driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by increases in labor and other costs to support increased enrollment, investments to support growth initiatives, and marketing expense. Walden Walden operating income increased 1,955.6 , or 37.9 million, to 39.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the prior year period. Segment adjusted operating income increased 37.0 , or 11.5 million, to 42.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the prior year period. The adjusted operating income increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was primarily driven by the increase in revenue, partially offset by increases in labor and other costs to support increased enrollment and investments to support growth initiatives. Medical and Veterinary Medical and Veterinary operating income increased 2.1 , or 0.3 million, to 14.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the prior year period. Segment adjusted operating income increased 1.7 , or 0.3 million, to 14.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the prior year period. The adjusted operating income increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was primarily driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by investments to support initiatives to drive future growth and provision for bad debts. Interest Expense Interest expense was 14.5 million and 15.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and 2024, respectively. This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest expense on our Term Loan B due to decreased borrowings and a lower interest rate, partially offset by an increase in letter of credit fees (as discussed in Note 13 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Other Income, Net Other income, net was 2.6 million and 2.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and 2024, respectively. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in investment gains, partially offset by a decrease in interest income. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate ETR from continuing operations can differ from the 21 U.S. federal statutory rate due to several factors, including tax on global intangible low-taxed income GILTI ), limitation of tax benefits on certain executive compensation, the rate of tax applied by state and local jurisdictions, the rate of tax applied to earnings outside the U.S., tax incentives, tax credits related to research and development expenditures, changes in valuation allowance, liabilities for uncertain tax positions, and tax benefits on stock-based compensation awards. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 20.8 and 18.9 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 increased compared to the prior year period primarily due to an increase in the percentage of earnings from operations in higher taxed jurisdictions and a limitation of tax benefits on certain executive compensation. Discontinued Operations Loss from discontinued operations was 0.1 million and 1.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and 2024, respectively. We continue to incur costs associated with ongoing litigation and settlements related to the DeVry University and Carrington College divestitures, which were completed during fiscal year 2019, and are classified as expense within discontinued operations.

 Financial Aid Like other higher education institutions, Adtalem s institutions are dependent upon the timely receipt of federal financial aid funds. All public financial aid programs are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations. Adtalem s institutions and their students participate in a wide range of financial aid programs, including U.S. federal financial aid, state financial aid, Canadian financial aid, private loan programs, tax-favored programs, Adtalem-provided financial assistance, and employer-provided financial assistance. In the U.S., the Higher Education Act (as reauthorized, the HEA guides the federal government s support of postsecondary education. If there are changes to financial aid programs that restrict student eligibility or reduce funding levels, Adtalem s financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 for a discussion of student financial aid related risks. Legislative and Regulatory Requirements Government-funded financial assistance programs are governed by extensive and complex regulations in the U.S. Like any other educational institution, Adtalem s institutions administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by regulatory agencies and is subject to audit or investigation by other authorities. Any violation could be the basis for penalties or other disciplinary action, including initiation of a suspension, limitation, or termination proceeding. Financial Responsibility Institutions must pass a U.S. Department of Education ED financial responsibility test, also known as a composite score, to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV aid programs. For Adtalem s institutions, this test is calculated at the consolidated Adtalem level. Applying various financial elements from annual audited financial statements, the score is a composite of three ratios: an equity ratio that measures the institution s capital resources; a primary reserve ratio that measures an institution s ability to fund its operations from current resources; and a net income ratio that measures an institution s ability to operate profitably. A score greater than or equal to 1.5 indicates the institution is considered financially responsible. A score of less than 1.5 but greater than or equal to 1.0 is considered financially responsible but require additional oversight. For example, an institution with a score in this range is subject to heightened cash monitoring and other participation requirements. An institution with a score of less than 1.0 is not considered financially responsible but may continue to participate in the Title IV programs under provisional certification. In addition, this lower score typically requires that the institution be subject to heightened cash monitoring requirements and post a letter of credit (equal to a minimum of 10 of the Title IV aid it received in the institution's most recent fiscal year). For the past several years, Adtalem s composite score was greater than 1.5. However, on September 25, 2023, ED notified Adtalem that its fiscal year 2022 composite score had declined to 0.2. As previously disclosed, this was expected due to the acquisition of Walden and other transactions. ED advised that Adtalem s five institutions will be permitted to continue to participate in Title IV under provisional certifications with heightened cash monitoring and continued reporting. A letter of credit in the amount of 157.9 million, representing 10 of the consolidated Title IV funds Adtalem s institutions received during fiscal year 2022, was delivered to ED on November 1, 2023. Management does not believe these conditions will have a material adverse effect on Adtalem s operations. The financial responsibility rules include other mandatory or discretionary triggers that could require an institution to post a letter of credit. ED recently amended the financial responsibility regulation and the changes took effect July 1, 2024. The changes include additional triggers which could require additional letters of credit. Program Participation Agreement PPA All institutions must apply periodically to ED for continued certification to participate in Title IV programs. Such recertification generally is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change in control. ED may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances, such as when an institution is certified for the first time or undergoes a change in control. During the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in the institution s PPA. In addition, ED may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location, add an

 educational program, acquire another institution, or make any other significant change. Students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive Title IV program funds. If ED determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its PPA, it may seek to revoke the institution s certification to participate in Title IV programs without advance notice or opportunity for the institution to challenge the action. Chamberlain was most recently recertified and issued an unrestricted PPA in September 2020, with a reapplication date of June 30, 2024. The lengthy PPA recertification process is such that ED allows unhampered continued access to Title IV funding after PPA expiration, so long as materially complete applications are submitted at least 90 days in advance of expiration. A complete application for Chamberlain s PPA recertification has been timely submitted to ED. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, ED approved Walden s change in ownership application and issued Walden a provisional PPA through June 30, 2025. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, ED provisionally recertified AUC and RUSM s Title IV PPAs through March 31, 2025. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, ED provisionally recertified RUSVM s Title IV PPA through March 31, 2027. The provisional nature of the PPAs stemmed from Adtalem s composite score declining and failing to meet ED s standards of financial responsibility as described above. Walden, AUC, and RUSM s provisional PPAs included financial requirements, such as letter of credit, heightened cash monitoring, and additional reporting. We do not believe these requirements will have a material effect on Adtalem s financial position or results of operations. Walden also is subject to customary restrictions following an acquisition limiting changes to its educational programs, including a prohibition on the addition of new programs or locations that had not been approved by ED prior to the change in ownership for a period established by ED. With the approval of its change in ownership, Walden has the ability to request ED approval for new programs. ED has recently allowed reductions totaling 90.8 million in our letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, Adtalem had 227.3 million of letters of credit outstanding in favor of ED. See Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements in Note 13 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Gainful Employment The HEA requires certificate programs at all Title IV institutions and degree programs at proprietary Title IV institutions to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. In October 2023, ED released new Financial Value Transparency FVT and Gainful Employment GE rules effective July 1, 2024. GE programs must meet a debt-to-earnings test in which graduates annual debt payments must not exceed 8 of their annual earnings or 20 of their discretionary earnings. GE programs must also meet an earnings premium test in which graduates earnings must exceed those of a typical high school graduate. Under the regulation, programs that fail either metric must provide warnings to students and prospective students that the program is at risk of losing Title IV eligibility, and programs that fail the same measure in two out of three consecutive years lose Title IV eligibility. The GE regulation also includes a transparency framework in which debt-to-earnings, earnings premium, and a wide range of other program outcomes for all Title IV programs are disclosed on a website hosted by ED. Because there are many factors and unknowns, including the earnings of program graduates, Adtalem is reviewing the regulation to determine what impact, if any, the regulation will have on its programs. In addition, multiple parties are seeking to block enforcement of the FVT/GE rule under the Administrative Procedure Act and other legal theories. The 90/10 Rule An ED regulation known as the 90/10 Rule affects only proprietary institutions participating in Title IV programs, including each of Adtalem s institutions. An institution that does not meet the 90 threshold for two consecutive fiscal years loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Previously, an institution could not derive more than 90 of its revenue on a cash basis from Title IV financial aid funds. In March 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act amended the 90/10 calculation to require no more than 90 of revenue at proprietary institutions be derived from any federal education assistance funds, including but not limited to previously excluded U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs benefits and Department of Defense tuition assistance funds. This change was subject to negotiated rulemaking with the final rule

Table of Contents 
 published by ED in October 2022. The amended rule applies to an institution s fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. For Adtalem s institutions, the updated 90/10 rule is therefore effective with the calculation for fiscal year 2024. The following table shows the 90/10 rates for each Adtalem institution for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 based on the old 90/10 rules still in effect for those periods. Final rates for fiscal year 2024 are not yet available. We are including Walden s amounts for the full fiscal year 2022 even though Walden was under Adtalem s ownership for only a portion of that fiscal year. We are also providing a consolidated rate for Adtalem even though it is not subject to 90/10 requirements. 

Fiscal Year 2023 2022 Chamberlain University 65 65 Walden University 78 73 American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine 81 81 Ross University School of Medicine 87 85 Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine 79 81 Consolidated 75 72 Liquidity and Capital Resources Adtalem s primary source of liquidity is the cash received from payments for student tuition, fees, books, and other educational materials. These payments include funds originating as financial aid from various federal and state loan and grant programs, student and family educational loans, employer educational reimbursements, scholarships, and student and family financial resources. Adtalem continues to provide financing options for its students, including Adtalem s credit extension programs. The pattern of cash receipts during the year is seasonal. Adtalem s cash collections on accounts receivable peak at the start of each institution s term. Accounts receivable reach their lowest level at the end of each institution s term. Adtalem s consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 264.8 million and 219.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, included cash and cash equivalents held at Adtalem s international operations of 4.6 million and 4.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, which is available to Adtalem for general corporate purposes. Cash Flow Summary Operating Activities The following table provides a summary of cash flows from operating activities (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Income from continuing operations 46,245 11,959 Non-cash items 59,790 50,266 Changes in assets and liabilities (16,468) 23,889 Net cash provided by operating activities-continuing operations 89,567 86,114 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 89.6 million compared to 86.1 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven by income from continuing operations and non-cash items, partially offset by changes in working capital. The increase of 9.5 million in non-cash items between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in deferred income taxes partially offset by a decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets. The decrease of 40.4 million in cash generated from changes in assets and liabilities between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to timing differences in accounts and financing receivables, prepaid assets, cloud computing implementation assets, accounts payable, accrued payroll and benefits, accrued liabilities, accrued interest, and deferred revenue.

 Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 9.5 million and 10.3 million, respectively, and was primarily driven by capital expenditures of 10.4 million and 10.4 million, respectively. The capital expenditures in fiscal year 2025 primarily consisted of spending for information technology investments and Chamberlain s campus development. For the remainder of fiscal year 2025, we expect capital spending on information technology, new campus development at Chamberlain, and facility improvements at the medical and veterinary schools. Management anticipates full fiscal year 2025 capital spending to be in the 55 to 75 million range. The source of funds for this capital spending will be from operations or the Credit Facility (as defined and discussed in Note 13 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Financing Activities The following table provides a summary of cash flows from financing activities (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Repurchases of common stock for treasury (33,190) (90,477) Other (921) (4,911) Net cash used in financing activities (34,111) (95,388) On March 1, 2022, we announced that the Board authorized Adtalem s thirteenth share repurchase program, which allowed Adtalem to repurchase up to 300.0 million of its common stock through February 25, 2025. On January 16, 2024, Adtalem completed its thirteenth share repurchase program. On January 19, 2024, we announced that the Board authorized Adtalem s fourteenth share repurchase program, which allows Adtalem to repurchase up to 300.0 million of its common stock through January 16, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, 177.7 million of authorized share repurchases were remaining under the fourteenth share repurchase program. The timing and amount of any future repurchases will be determined based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. See Note 14 Share Repurchases to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our share repurchase programs. On March 1, 2021, we issued 800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50 Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the Notes ), which mature on March 1, 2028. On August 12, 2021, Adtalem entered into its new credit agreement (the Credit Agreement that provides for (1) a 850.0 million senior secured term loan Term Loan B with a maturity date of August 12, 2028 and (2) a 400.0 million senior secured revolving loan facility Revolver with a maturity date of August 12, 2026. We refer to the Term Loan B and Revolver collectively as the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balance of the Notes and Term Loan B was 405.0 million and 253.3 million, respectively. See Note 13 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Notes and our Credit Agreement. In the event of unexpected market conditions or negative economic changes that could negatively affect Adtalem s earnings and/or operating cash flow, Adtalem maintains a 400.0 million revolving credit facility with availability of 242.1 million as of September 30, 2024. Material Cash Requirements Long-Term Debt As of September 30, 2024, we have principal balances of 405.0 million of Notes and 253.3 million of Term Loan B, which requires interest payments. With previous Term Loan B prepayments, we are no longer required to make quarterly principal installment payments on the Term Loan B. See Note 13 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Notes and our Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, Adtalem had 227.3 million of letters of credit outstanding in favor of ED. See Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements in Note 13 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Many states require private-sector postsecondary education institutions to post surety bonds for licensure. In the U.S., Adtalem has posted 58.3 million of surety bonds as of September 30, 2024 with regulatory authorities on behalf of Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM.

 Operating Lease Obligations We have operating lease obligations for the minimum payments required under various lease agreements which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we sublease certain space to third parties, which partially offsets the lease obligations at these facilities. See Note 11 Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our lease agreements. Critical Accounting Estimates There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cautionary Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact, which includes statements regarding Adtalem s future growth. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as future, believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, plan, intend, may, will, would, could, can, continue, preliminary, range, and similar terms. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include the risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 and that might be contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to us as of the date any such statements are made, and Adtalem assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized, except as required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations We believe that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of Adtalem s ongoing operations as seen through the eyes of management and are useful for period-over-period comparisons. We use these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally in our assessment of performance and budgeting process. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following are non-GAAP financial measures used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q: Adjusted net income (most comparable GAAP measure: net income) Measure of Adtalem s net income adjusted for restructuring expense, business integration expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, litigation reserve, debt modification costs, and loss from discontinued operations. Adjusted earnings per share (most comparable GAAP measure: diluted earnings per share) Measure of Adtalem s diluted earnings per share adjusted for restructuring expense, business integration expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, litigation reserve, debt modification costs, and loss from discontinued operations. Adjusted operating income (most comparable GAAP measure: operating income) Measure of Adtalem s operating income adjusted for restructuring expense, business integration expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, litigation reserve, and debt modification costs. This measure is applied on a consolidated and segment basis, depending on the context of the discussion. Adjusted EBITDA (most comparable GAAP measure: net income) Measure of Adtalem s net income adjusted for loss from discontinued operations, interest expense, other income, net, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization

 of acquired intangible assets, amortization of cloud computing implementation assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring expense, business integration expense, litigation reserve, and debt modification costs. This measure is applied on a consolidated and segment basis, depending on the context of the discussion. Provision for income taxes, interest expense, and other income, net is not recorded at the reportable segments, and therefore, the segment adjusted EBITDA reconciliations begin with operating income. A description of special items in our non-GAAP financial measures described above are as follows: Restructuring expense primarily related to workforce reductions, costs to exit certain course offerings, and prior real estate consolidations at Adtalem s home office. We do not include normal, recurring, cash operating expenses in our restructuring expense. Business integration expense include expenses related to the Walden acquisition and certain costs related to growth transformation initiatives. We do not include normal, recurring, cash operating expenses in our business integration expense. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of cloud computing implementation assets. Reserves related to significant litigation and debt modification costs related to refinancing our Term Loan B loan. Loss from discontinued operations includes expense from ongoing litigation costs and settlements related to the DeVry University and Carrington College divestitures. The following tables provide a reconciliation from the most directly comparable GAAP measure to these non-GAAP financial measures.
