, Nexstar acquired a ownership interest in The CW. Pursuant to the operating agreement governing The CW, Nexstar has a call right to acquire the noncontrolling ownership interests in The CW beginning in August 2024 and each noncontrolling owner has a put right to sell its ownership interest in The CW to Nexstar beginning in June 2026, subject to Nexstar s one year deferral right, for cash. The amount at which the noncontrolling interests can be redeemed under either the call right or the put rights is the greater of the capital contributed by the minority owners or a multiple of The CW s earnings. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented as mezzanine equity (outside of liability and stockholders equity) in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as their redemption is outside of our control. We accrete the changes in the redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests over the period from issuance to the earliest redemption date using the effective interest method. The accretion is recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings, or in the absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital. The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is measured at the greater of accreted redemption value at the end of each reporting period or the carrying value adjusted for the noncontrolling interests contributions and share in income and losses. During the third quarter of 2024, Nexstar recorded an adjustment to establish a million carrying amount of noncontrolling interests to redeemable noncontrolling interests and reduced retained earnings by million to accrete redeemable noncontrolling interests. The noncontrolling interests were previously accounted for as a component of stockholders equity when it should have been mezzanine equity since acquisition of The CW as described above. See the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests for additional information. The inclusion of accretion in the calculation of earnings per share and the impact of out-of-period accretion adjustment to earnings per share are disclosed in Note 13. We evaluated the impact of the out-of-period adjustment under the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Materiality , SAB 99 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, SAB 108 from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives and determined that it was not material to the previously reported annual and interim financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and is not expected to be material to the current annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Nexstar s outstanding term loans are governed by Nexstar s credit agreement and Mission s outstanding term loans and revolving loans are governed by Mission s credit agreement. Each credit agreement is also herein referred to as a senior secured credit facility. Nexstar s senior unsecured notes are governed by the indentures. 2024 Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid scheduled principal maturities of million and prepaid million of Term Loan B, funded by cash on hand. Also, Nexstar borrowed million under its revolving credit facility for working capital purposes, which it repaid in full during the same period. Unused Commitments and Borrowing Availability Nexstar and Mission had million (net of outstanding standby letters of credit of million) and million, respectively, of unused revolving loan commitments under their senior secured credit facilities, all of which were available for borrowing, based on the covenant calculations as of September 30, 2024. The Company s ability to access funds under the senior secured credit facilities depends, in part, on its compliance with certain financial covenants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants. Collateralization and Guarantees of Debt The Company s senior secured credit facilities described above are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all the combined assets, excluding FCC licenses, the other assets of consolidated VIEs unavailable to creditors of Nexstar (see Note 2) and the assets of The CW. Nexstar (excluding The CW) guarantees full payment of all obligations incurred under the Mission senior secured credit facility in the event of Mission s default. Mission is a guarantor of Nexstar s senior secured credit facility, Nexstar s Notes, due July 2027 and Nexstar s Notes, due November 2028. In consideration of Nexstar s guarantee of the Mission senior secured credit facility, Mission has granted Nexstar purchase options to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission station, subject to FCC consent. These option agreements, which expire on various dates between 2024 and 2033, are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by Mission. The Company expects these option agreements to be renewed upon expiration.

to 1.00. The financial covenant, which is formally calculated on a quarterly basis, is based on the combined results of the Company, excluding the operating results of The CW, which Nexstar designated as an unrestricted subsidiary under its credit agreements and indentures. The Mission amended credit agreement does not contain financial covenant ratio requirements but does provide for default in the event Nexstar does not comply with all covenants contained in its credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024 , Nexstar was in compliance with its financial covenants.

Indemnification Obligations In connection with certain agreements that the Company enters into in the normal course of its business, including local service agreements, business acquisitions and borrowing arrangements, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which the Company agrees to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from losses, claims and damages incurred by the indemnified party for certain events as defined within the particular contract. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses and the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification arrangements may be unlimited. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been insignificant and the Company has not incurred significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. Litigation From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation that arises from the ordinary operations of business, such as contractual or employment disputes or other general actions. In the event of an adverse outcome of these proceedings, the Company believes the resulting liabilities would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

; Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on . Before the Court ruled on that motion, the Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Consolidated Complaint on . This complaint added additional defendants and allegations. The Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss and Strike on . The Court denied that motion on November 6, 2020. On March 16, 2022, the Plaintiffs filed their Third Amended Complaint. The Third Amended Complaint adds two additional plaintiffs and an additional defendant, but does not make material changes to the allegations. The parties are in the discovery phase of litigation. The Court has not yet set a trial date. Nexstar and Tribune deny all allegations against them and will defend their advertising practices. Tribune Related Contingencies In connection with Nexstar s acquisition of Tribune on September 19, 2019, Nexstar assumed contingencies from certain legal proceedings, as follows: Chicago Cubs Transactions On August 21, 2009, Tribune and Chicago Entertainment Ventures, LLC (formerly Chicago Baseball Holdings, LLC) CEV LLC ), and its subsidiaries (collectively, New Cubs LLC ), among other parties, entered into an agreement (the Cubs Formation Agreement governing the contribution of certain assets and liabilities related to the businesses of the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball franchise then owned by Tribune and its subsidiaries to New Cubs LLC. The transactions contemplated by the Cubs Formation Agreement and the related agreements thereto (the Chicago Cubs Transactions closed on October 27, 2009. As a result of these transactions, Northside Entertainment Holdings LLC (f/k/a Ricketts Acquisition LLC) NEH owned and Tribune owned of the membership interests in CEV LLC. The fair market value of the contributed assets exceeded the tax basis and did not result in an immediate taxable gain as the transaction was structured to comply with the partnership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. On June 28, 2016, the Internal Revenue Service IRS issued Tribune a Notice of Deficiency which presented the IRS s position that the gain with respect to the Chicago Cubs Transactions should have been included in Tribune s 2009 taxable income. Accordingly, the IRS proposed a million tax and a million gross valuation misstatement penalty. During the third quarter of 2016, Tribune filed a petition in U.S. Tax Court to contest the IRS s determination. After-tax interest on the aforementioned proposed tax and penalty through September 30, 2024 would be approximately million. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its position, under the tax rules for determining tax basis upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company would be required to reduce its tax basis in certain assets. The reduction in tax basis would be required to reflect the reduction in the amount of the Company s guarantee of the New Cubs partnership debt which was included in the reported tax basis previously determined upon emergence from bankruptcy and subject to Tribune s 2014 and 2015 federal income tax audits (described below). On September 19, 2019, Tribune became a wholly owned subsidiary of Nexstar following Nexstar s merger with Tribune. Nexstar disagrees with the IRS s position that the Chicago Cubs Transactions generated taxable gain in 2009, the proposed penalty and the IRS s calculation of the gain. If the IRS prevails in its position, the gain on the Chicago Cubs Transactions would be deemed to be taxable in 2009. Nexstar estimates that the federal and state income taxes would be approximately million before interest and penalties. Any tax, interest and penalty due will be offset by tax payments made relating to this transaction subsequent to 2009. Tribune made approximately million of tax payments prior to its merger with Nexstar.

million increase in its federal and state taxes payable and a million increase in deferred income tax liability as of September 30, 2024. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, the Company has reflected million for certain contested issues in its liability for uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Regulatory Matters On March 21, 2024, the FCC issued a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture NAL to Nexstar and to Mission, a consolidated VIE, for alleged violations of the Communications Act and FCC rules relating to Mission television station WPIX, New York, New York. The NAL alleges that Nexstar and Mission engaged in an unauthorized transfer of control of WPIX and that Nexstar violated the national television ownership limit by acquiring undisclosed attributable interests in the station. The NAL proposes forfeitures to Nexstar and Mission for the alleged violations and additionally requires that within 12 months of a forfeiture order or payment of the forfeitures, either (i) Mission divest WPIX to an unrelated third party or (ii) Mission sell WPIX to Nexstar, with Nexstar divesting a sufficient number of other stations to reduce its national reach below the FCC national ownership limit. Nexstar and Mission have filed responses vigorously disputing the NAL. Nexstar is unable to reasonably estimate the possible financial statement impact, if any, relating to the NAL. WADL-TV On May 22, 2024, Mission terminated its proposed acquisition of WADL-TV serving the Detroit, Michigan market from Adell Broadcasting Corporation. There were no fees that resulted from the termination. 

million. On July 26, 2024, Nexstar s board of directors announced the increase of its share repurchase authorization by billion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Nexstar repurchased a total of shares of its common stock for million, funded by cash on hand. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining available amount under the share repurchase authorization was billion. Share repurchases are executed from time to time in open market transactions, block trades or private transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. There is no minimum number of shares that Nexstar is required to repurchase. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. On , Nexstar s board of directors approved a increase in its quarterly cash dividend to per share of outstanding common stock beginning with the first quarter of 2024.

million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to million for the same period in 2023. The effective tax rates were and for each of the respective periods. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other permanent differences, including a reduction in losses related to the minority interest in The CW, resulted in a decrease to the effective tax rate. State taxes were impacted by decreased permanent differences resulting in a decrease to the effective rate. This was partially offset by changes in the valuation allowance which resulted in a increase to the effective tax rate. A decrease in the excess benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting in compared to 2023 resulted in a increase in the rate. The effective rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is normalized compared to the same period in 2023 which reflected a significantly lower pre-tax net income. The rate changes discussed reflect that normalization impact. Income tax expense was million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to million for the same period in 2023. The effective tax rates were and for each of the respective periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, changes in the valuation allowance resulted in a decrease to the effective tax rate. Other permanent differences, including a reduction in losses related to the minority interest in The CW, resulted in a decrease to the effective tax rate. This is partially offset by a decrease in the excess benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting in compared to 2023 which resulted in a increase in the rate. The Company calculates its year-to-date provision for income taxes by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax income or loss and adjusts the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the period. Future changes in the forecasted annual income projections could result in significant adjustments to quarterly income tax expense in future periods.

Our primary sources of revenue include: (i) distribution, comprised primarily of retransmission revenue, carriage fees, affiliation fees and spectrum leasing revenue and (ii) advertising, comprised of non-political and political advertising. Distribution revenue, our largest category of revenue, primarily results from compensation from cable, satellite and other multichannel video distributors MVPDs and online video distributors, or virtual multichannel video distributors, vMVPDs in return for our consent to the retransmission of the signals of our television stations and the carriage of NewsNation, typically based on the number of subscribers the MVPDs and vMVPDs have. We also generate distribution revenues from affiliation fees paid by affiliates of The CW and from programmers who lease the use of our spectrum in selected local markets to air their content on our multicast streams. Distribution revenue is recognized at the point in time the broadcast signal or cable network feed is delivered to the distributors in the case of retransmission and carriage fee revenue or, in the case of affiliation fees and spectrum leasing revenue, as network programming and spectrum capacity are delivered to our affiliates and customers. Advertising revenue primarily results from the sale to local, regional and national businesses, political candidates and other political advertisers of commercial airtime by our stations and networks and the sale of advertising on our owned or third-party websites, and through mobile and OTT applications and other digital advertising solutions. Advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to, and including, the holiday season. Advertising revenue is generally higher during even-numbered years when congressional and/or presidential elections occur and advertising is aired during the Olympic Games. Advertising revenue is recognized at the time the advertisement airs or is delivered on our websites or mobile or OTT applications or the advertising solution is delivered.

Overview of Operations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned, operated, programmed or provided sales and other services to 200 full power television stations and one AM radio station, including those owned by VIEs, in 116 markets in 40 states and the District of Columbia. The stations are affiliates of ABC, NBC, FOX, CBS, The CW, MyNetworkTV and other broadcast television networks. Through various local service agreements, we provided sales, programming and other services to 37 full power television stations owned by independent third parties, of which 35 full power television stations are VIEs that are consolidated into our financial statements. We also own a 75.0 interest in The CW, the fifth major broadcast network in the U.S., NewsNation, a national cable news network, two digital multicast networks, Antenna TV and REWIND TV, multicast network services provided to third parties, and a 31.3 ownership stake in TV Food Network. Our digital assets include 138 local websites, 121 mobile applications, 91 weather applications and 17 lifestyle and sports applications across local stations, NewsNation and The Hill. The portfolio also includes seven connected television applications and three free ad-supported television channels from The CW and The Hill. 
 
 We (excluding The CW) guarantee full payment of all obligations incurred under Mission Broadcasting, Inc. s Mission senior secured credit facility in the event of its default. Mission is a guarantor of our senior secured credit facility, our 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and our 4.75 Notes, due November 2028. In consideration of our guarantee of Mission s senior secured credit facility, Mission has granted us purchase options to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission station, subject to FCC consent. These option agreements (which expire on various dates between 2024 and 2033) are freely exercisable or assignable by us without consent or approval by Mission or its shareholders. We expect these option agreements to be renewed upon expiration. 
 We do not own the consolidated VIEs or their television stations. However, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have controlling financial interests for financial reporting purposes in these entities because of (i) the local service agreements we have with their stations, (ii) our (excluding The CW) guarantee of the obligations incurred under Mission s senior secured credit facility, (iii) our power over significant activities affecting the consolidated VIEs economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, certain advertising sales and, in some cases, hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (iv) purchase options granted by each consolidated VIE which permit us to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each of these VIEs stations at any time, subject to FCC consent. In compliance with FCC regulations for all the parties, each of the consolidated VIEs maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances and personnel for its stations. 
 See Note 2, Variable Interest Entities to our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information on VIEs, including a discussion of the local service agreements we have with these independent third parties. 
 Seasonality 
 In even-numbered years we generate substantial advertising revenue from the political advertising we sell to candidates and non-candidate entities such as political action committees and political parties. Advertising revenue is also positively affected by certain events such as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl. Advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to, and including, the holiday season. As 2024 is an election year, we expect an increase in political advertising revenue, a component of our advertising revenue, to be reported in 2024 compared to 2023.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Same Period in 2023 
 
 The Company s revenues increased 20.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher revenues from distribution and political advertising, partially offset by lower revenue from non-political advertising. 
 Distribution revenue increased by 121 million primarily due to the comparison with the three months ended September 30, 2023 when a dispute with an MVPD caused Nexstar stations to be dark for 76 days during the quarter, the benefit of distribution contract renewals in 2023 on terms favorable to the Company, annual rate escalators, growth in vMVPD subscribers, the addition of CW affiliations on certain of our stations, and the return of partner stations on one MVPD in January, which more than offset MVPD subscriber attrition.. 
 Advertising revenue increased by 113 million, primarily due to an increase in political advertising of 135 million as 2024 is an election year, offset in part by a decrease in non-political revenue of 22 million due to ongoing advertising market softness. 
 Direct operating expenses, consisting primarily of programming, news and technical expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 23 million primarily due to increased news expenses related to expansion of news programming, programming expenses primarily due to lower variable programming expenses in 2023 as a result of the period when Nexstar stations were dark and stock-based compensation expense from new restricted stock grants and the timing of restricted stock grants, partially offset by lower expense from various administrative expenses. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by 30 million, as follows: 
 Amortization of broadcast rights was 70 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 98 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 28 million, primarily due to lower amortization of broadcast rights at The CW of 26 million to 54 million from 80 million. 

Depreciation of property and equipment was 46 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 44 million for the same period in 2023 (no significant change). 

Amortization of intangible assets was 74 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 78 million for the same period in 2023 (no significant change). 

Income from equity method investments, net decreased by 7 million primarily due to a decrease in net income of TV Food Network, our largest equity method investment. TV Food Network s net income decreased primarily due to a decrease in its advertising revenue. For additional information on our investment in TV Food Network, refer to Note 5 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The Company s effective tax rates were 26.2 and 42.9 for each of the respective periods. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other permanent differences, including a reduction in losses related to the minority interest in The CW, resulted in a 32.7 decrease to the effective tax rate. State taxes were impacted by decreased permanent differences resulting in a 3.8 decrease to the effective rate. This was partially offset by changes in the valuation allowance which resulted in a 9.2 increase to the effective tax rate. A decrease in the excess benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting in 2024 compared to 2023 resulted in a 3.5 increase in the rate. The effective rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is normalized compared to the same period in 2023 which reflected a significantly lower pre-tax net income. The rate changes discussed reflect that normalization impact. 
 The Company calculates its year-to-date provision for income taxes by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax income or loss and adjusts the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the period. Future changes in the forecasted annual income projections could result in significant adjustments to quarterly income tax expense in future periods.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Same Period in 2023 
 
 The Company s revenues increased 8.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher revenues from distribution and political advertising, partially offset by lower revenue from non-political advertising. 
 Distribution revenue increased by 192 million primarily due to the comparison with the three months ended September 30, 2023 when a dispute with an MVPD caused Nexstar stations to be dark for 76 days during the quarter, the benefit of distribution contract renewals in 2023 on terms favorable to the Company, annual rate escalators, growth in vMVPD subscribers, the addition of CW affiliations on certain of our stations, and the return of partner stations on one MVPD in January, which more than offset MVPD subscriber attrition. 
 Advertising revenue increased by 121 million primarily due to an increase of 202 million in political advertising as 2024 is an election year, offset in part by a decrease in non-political revenue of 81 million due to ongoing advertising market softness. 
 Direct operating expenses, consisting primarily of programming, news and technical expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 60 million primarily due to increased news expenses related to expansion of news programming, programming expenses primarily due to lower variable programming expenses in 2023 as a result of the period when Nexstar stations were dark, stock-based compensation expense from new restricted stock grants and the timing of restricted stock grants, and direct digital operating expenses, partially offset by lower expense from various administrative expenses. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 143 million, as follows: 
 Amortization of broadcast rights was 226 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 367 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 141 million, primarily due to lower amortization of broadcast rights at The CW of 130 million to 177 million from 307 million. 

Depreciation of property and equipment was 137 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 131 million for the same period in 2023 (no significant change). 

Amortization of intangible assets was 225 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 233 million for the same period in 2023 (no significant change). 

Income from equity method investments, net decreased by 30 million primarily due to a decrease in net income of TV Food Network, our largest equity method investment. TV Food Network s net income decreased primarily due to a decrease in its advertising revenue. For additional information on our investment in TV Food Network, refer to Note 5 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Interest expense, net increased by 8 million, primarily due to increases in interest rates in the Company s outstanding loans under its senior secured credit facilities, partially offset by decreases in interest expense from debt repayments. 
 In February 2024, Nexstar received 40 million in cash proceeds, and recorded a gain on disposal of an investment for the same amount, in connection with BMI s sale to New Mountain Capital. 
 The Company s effective tax rates were 27.2 and 32.7 for each of the respective periods. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, changes in the valuation allowance resulted in a 3.4 decrease to the effective tax rate. Other permanent differences, including a reduction in losses related to the minority interest in The CW, resulted in a 3.6 decrease to the effective tax rate. This is partially offset by a decrease in the excess benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting in 2024 compared to 2023 which resulted in a 1.4 increase in the rate. 
 The Company calculates its year-to-date provision for income taxes by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax income or loss and adjusts the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the period. Future changes in the forecasted annual income projections could result in significant adjustments to quarterly income tax expense in future periods.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company is leveraged, which makes it vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions. The Company s ability to repay or refinance its debt will depend on, among other things, financial, business, market, competitive and other conditions, many of which are beyond the Company s control. The Company s primary sources of liquidity include cash on hand, borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities (with a maturity date of June 2027) and cash generated from operations. The Company believes these sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet its business operating requirements, its capital expenditures and to continue to service its debt for at least the next 12 months as of the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the amended credit agreements governing its senior secured credit facilities. 
 Any future adverse economic conditions, including those resulting from heightened and sustained inflation and higher interest rates, could adversely affect the Company s future operating results, cash flows and financial condition.

Cash Flows Operating Activities 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased by 22 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This was primarily due to an increase in sources of cash from (i) an increase in operating income (excluding non-cash transactions of) of 246 million and (ii) a decrease in payments for broadcast rights of 82 million, partially offset by (i) timing of receipts and payables of 139 million, including prepaying fees associated with our TBA of KAZT-TV, (ii) a decrease in distribution from our equity investment in TV Food Network of 116 million and (iii) higher income taxes paid of 45 million. 
 Cash Flows Investing Activities 
 Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by 69 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This was primarily due to the proceeds received from the disposal of an investment in connection with BMI s sale to New Mountain Capital of 40 million and a decrease in uses of cash from payment of acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 38 million. 
 Cash Flows Financing Activities 
 Net cash flows used in financing activities increased by 1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This was primarily due to the prepayment of Term Loan B of 54 million, a 28 million decrease in contributions from noncontrolling interests and a 22 million increase in common stock dividends paid, offset in part by a decrease in stock buybacks of 86 million and lower cash paid for shares withheld for taxes of 16 million. 
 
 30 

Subsequent Investing and Financing Activities 
 From October 1, 2024 to November 7, 2024, we repurchased 458,261 shares of our common stock for 78 million, funded by cash on hand. As of the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the remaining available amount under the share repurchase authorization was 1.7 billion. 
 On November 1, 2024, Nexstar s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 1.69 per share of its common stock. The dividend is payable on November 29, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 15, 2024. 
 Our senior secured credit facility may limit the amount of dividends we may pay to stockholders over the term of the agreement. 
 Long-term debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total outstanding debt of 6.7 billion, net of unamortized financing costs, discounts and premium, which represented 75.1 of the Company s combined capitalization. The Company s high level of debt requires that a substantial portion of cash flow be dedicated to pay principal and interest on debt, which reduces the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.

We (excluding The CW) guarantee full payment of all obligations incurred under Mission s senior secured credit facility in the event of its default. Mission is a guarantor of our senior secured credit facility, our 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and our 4.75 Notes, due November 2028. In consideration of our guarantee of Mission s senior secured credit facility, Mission has granted us purchase options to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission station, subject to FCC consent. These option agreements (which expire on various dates between 2024 and 2033) are freely exercisable or assignable by us without consent or approval by Mission or its shareholders. We expect these option agreements to be renewed upon expiration. 
 
 We make semiannual interest payments on the 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 on January 15 and July 15 of each year. We make semiannual interest payments on our 4.75 Notes, due November 2028 on May 1 and November 1 of each year. Interest payments on our and Mission s senior secured credit facilities are generally paid every one to three months and are payable based on the type of interest rate selected. 
 
 31 

The terms of our and Mission s senior secured credit facilities, as well as the indentures governing our 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and 4.75 Notes, due November 2028, limit, but do not prohibit us or Mission, from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt in the future. The Company s senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our existing notes may limit the amount of dividends we may pay to stockholders and share repurchases we may make over the term of the agreement. 
 The Company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its debt. However, a downgrade in the Company s credit rating could adversely affect its ability to renew the existing credit facilities, obtain access to new credit facilities or otherwise issue debt in the future and could increase the cost of such debt. 
 The Company s ability to access funds under its senior secured credit facilities depends, in part, on its compliance with certain financial covenants. Any additional drawings under the senior secured credit facilities will reduce the Company s future borrowing capacity and the amount of total unused revolving loan commitments. Any future adverse economic conditions, including those resulting from heightened and sustained inflation and higher interest rates, could adversely affect our future operating results and cash flows and may cause us to seek alternative sources of funding, including accessing capital markets, subject to market conditions. Such alternative sources of funding may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 Our credit agreement contains a covenant which requires us to comply with a maximum consolidated first lien net leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.00. The financial covenant, which is formally calculated on a quarterly basis, is based on the Company s combined results, excluding the operating results of The CW, which Nexstar designated as an unrestricted subsidiary under its credit agreement and indentures. The Mission amended credit agreement does not contain financial covenant ratio requirements but does provide for default in the event we do not comply with all covenants contained in our credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenant. We believe the Company will be able to maintain compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreements governing its senior secured facilities and the indentures governing Nexstar s 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and Nexstar s 4.75 Notes, due November 2028 for a period of at least the next 12 months as of the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or VIEs, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. All of our arrangements with our VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary are on-balance sheet arrangements. Our variable interests in other entities are obtained through local service agreements, which have valid business purposes and transfer certain station activities from the station owners to us. We are, therefore, not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding standby letters of credit with various financial institutions amounting to 19 million. The outstanding balance of standby letters of credit is deducted against our unused revolving loan commitment under our senior secured credit facility and would not be available for withdrawal. 
 Issuer and Guarantor Summarized Financial Information 
 Nexstar Media Inc. (the Issuer is the issuer of 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and 4.75 Notes, due November 2028. These notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Nexstar Media Group, Inc. Parent ), Mission (a consolidated VIE) and the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined below). The Issuer, Subsidiary Guarantors, Parent and Mission are collectively referred to as the Obligor Group for the 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and 4.75 Notes, due November 2028. Subsidiary Guarantors refers to certain of the Issuer s restricted subsidiaries (excluding The CW) that guarantee these notes. The guarantees of the notes are subject to release in limited circumstances upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions set forth in the indentures governing the 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and the 4.75 Notes, due November 2028. The 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and 4.75 Notes, due November 2028 are not registered with the SEC.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and any such differences could be material to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Information with respect to the Company s critical accounting estimates which it believes could have the most significant effect on the Company s reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management believes that as of September 30, 2024, there has been no material change to this information. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 2 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including our expected date of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial position. 
 33 

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long-term debt obligations. 
 The term loan borrowings under the Company s senior secured credit facilities bear interest at rates ranging from 6.35 to 7.35 as of September 30, 2024, which represent (i) the base rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus (ii) a credit spread adjustment, and (iii) the applicable margin, as defined. Interest is payable in accordance with the credit agreements. 
 Based on the outstanding balances of the Company s senior secured credit facilities (term loans and revolving loans) as of September 30, 2024, an increase in SOFR by 100 basis points would increase our annual interest expense and decrease our cash flow from operations by 40 million (excluding tax effects). A decrease in SOFR by 100 basis points would decrease our annual interest expense and increase our cash flow from operations by 40 million (excluding tax effects). Our 5.625 Notes, due July 2027 and 4.75 Notes, due November 2028 are fixed rate debt obligations and therefore are not exposed to market interest rate changes. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has no financial instruments in place to hedge against changes in the benchmark interest rates on its senior secured credit facilities. 
 I TEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Nexstar s management, with the participation of its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer along with its Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Nexstar s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. 
 Based upon that evaluation, Nexstar s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, Nexstar s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to Nexstar s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 As of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in Nexstar s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
