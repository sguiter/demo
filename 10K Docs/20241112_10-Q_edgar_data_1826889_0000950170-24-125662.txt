 Summary of Changes in Significant Accounting Estimates indefinite-lived intangible assets. Due to the sustained decline in the Company s market capitalization in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the impact of the Pivot, which was approved by the Board of Directors (the Board of the Company in late September 2024, the Company performed an interim test for impairment of its goodwill as of September 30, 2024. In performing the interim impairment test for goodwill, the Company elected to bypass the optional qualitative test and proceeded to perform a quantitative test by comparing the carrying value of its RU to its estimated fair value. The Company previously tested its RU for impairment as of December 31, 2023. The results of the Company s interim test for impairment at September 30, 2024 concluded that the fair value of its RU exceeded its carrying value, resulting in impairment.

Total revenue 

(1) 
 The Company determined that, in addition to the preceding table, the disaggregation of revenue by revenue type as presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations achieves the disclosure requirement to disaggregate revenue into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue is recorded for nonrefundable cash payments received for the Company s performance obligation to transfer, or stand ready to transfer, goods or services in the future. Deferred revenue consists of subscription fees billed that have not been recognized and physical products sold that have not yet been delivered. The Company expects to recognize approximately of the remaining performance obligations as revenue in the next months, and the remainder thereafter. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million and million , respectively, of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized million and million , respectively, of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 .

The Company s Private Placement Warrants (as defined below), Term Loan Warrants (as defined below) and Common Stock Warrants (as defined below), and the Company's Public Warrants (as defined below) after they ceased trading on an active market, are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because their fair values are based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market. Private Placement Warrants The Company determined the fair value of the outstanding warrants for the purchase of shares of the Company's Class A common stock at an exercise price of per share (the "Private Placement Warrants") using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the quoted price of the Company s Class A common stock. Volatility was based on the implied volatility derived from the Company s historical volatility. The expected life was based on the remaining contractual term of the Private Placement Warrants, and the risk-free interest rate was based on the implied yield available on U.S. treasury securities with a maturity equivalent to the Private Placement Warrants expected life. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Private Placement Warrants is the implied volatility. Significant changes in the implied volatility would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement, respectively.

Volatility was based on the implied volatility derived from the Company's historical volatility. The expected life was based on the remaining contractual term of the Public Warrants, and the risk-free interest rate was based on the implied yield available on U.S. treasury securities with a maturity equivalent to the Public Warrants expected life.

On September 30, 2024, the Company announced the Pivot, which resulted in certain computer software and web development and computer equipment with a net book value of approximately million that will no longer be used by the Company after December 31, 2024. The impact of the Pivot related to these long-lived assets was considered by management to be a triggering event that caused the Company to perform a recoverability test for its long-lived assets as of September 30, 2024. See Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , for additional information on the Company's recoverability test for its long-lived assets. The Company decreased the average remaining useful lives for the long-lived assets that were impacted by the Pivot from prior to the Pivot to after the Pivot. This resulted in accelerated depreciation expense for these assets being recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of million and is expected to result in accelerated depreciation expense of million being recorded in the quarter ending December 31, 2024.

Such claims typically involve its products, intellectual property, and relationships with suppliers, customers, distributors, employees, and others. Contingent liabilities are recorded when it is both probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonable estimated. Although it is not possible to predict how litigation and other claims will be resolved, the Company does not believe that any currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. On May 22, 2023, Jessica Lyons, an individual, and a group of other plaintiffs filed a class action complaint with the Los Angeles County Superior Court alleging that the Company misclassified its Partners as contractors rather than as employees and committed other violations of the California Labor Code. The Company understands that the plaintiffs in this matter intend on filing additional claims under the Private Attorney General Act of 2004. The Company and certain executive officers are listed as defendants in the complaint. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages. The Company filed a motion to compel arbitration in the case. The firm representing Ms. Lyons has also filed 13 arbitration actions in Los Angeles County in anticipation that the Company's motion to compel arbitration will be upheld. All arbitration proceedings have been stayed pending the outcome of the mediation and follow-up discussions. This matter is pending as of the date of this quarterly report. We deny the allegations in the complaint, believe they are without merit, and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this action. On September 6, 2023 Dish Technologies LLC and SLING TV LLC (the "DISH Entities") filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company infringed on the DISH Entities' patents and used technology belonging to the DISH Entities without their permission. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In an effort to avoid any further unnecessary litigation costs, the parties entered into a Confidential Standstill and Tolling Agreement as of April 16, 2024 which included a dismissal of the case by the DISH Entities without prejudice and an agreement by the DISH Entities not to institute any litigation proceedings against the Company under the patents any earlier than December 31, 2026 in exchange for a one-time immaterial payment to the DISH Entities by the Company.

We deny the allegations in the complaint, believe they are without merit, and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this action. Some of our legal proceedings, such as the above referenced complaints, may be based on complex claims involving substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, it is not possible to determine the probability of loss or estimate damages for any of the above matters, and therefore the Company has not established reserves for any of these proceedings. When the Company determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability, and, if the liability is material, discloses the amount of the liability reserved. Given that such proceedings are subject to uncertainty, there can be no assurance that such legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Recent Developments 
 Pivot Restructuring 
 On September 30, 2024, the Company announced the Pivot which will convert the Company s MLM model to a single level affiliate model and will reduce the Company's headcount by approximately 170 employees (33 of the Company s workforce on that date) in the fourth quarter of 2024. The actions associated with the Pivot are expected to result in approximately 18.4 million in costs, with approximately 9.2 million recorded in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations in the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024 with approximately 9.2 million expected to be recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2024. 
 The following table details the costs incurred and benefits realized associated with the Pivot in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024:

Total Restructuring Costs 

9,159 

(1) Termination and retention benefits which are included in restructuring expense in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations of approximately 5.1 million were recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company expects to record an additional 1.1 million in restructuring expense in the three months ended December 31, 2024. 
 (2) Due to the Pivot, certain long-lived assets with a net book value of approximately 12.7 million will not be used by the Company after December 31, 2024. The Company performed an impairment review for its long-lived assets, including the long-lived assets that will not be used after December 31, 2024. The Company performed a test of recoverability and concluded that the carrying value of its long-lived assets, which are all in one asset group, were recoverable. The Company decreased the average remaining useful lives for the long-lived assets that were impacted by the Pivot from 25 months prior to the Pivot to 3 months after the Pivot. This resulted in accelerated depreciation expense of 2.9 million that was recorded in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 8.1 million which is expected to be recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2024. See Note 6, Property and Equipment, Net , for additional information on the accelerated depreciation. 
 (3) Consists of (a) inventory adjustments recorded associated with the decision by management to no longer sell connected fitness inventory after December 31, 2024, which was recorded in cost of revenue-connected fitness 1.2 million) and (b) inventory adjustments for nutrition and other inventory impacted by the Pivot which was recorded in cost of revenue-nutrition and other 0.2 million) in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 4, Inventory , for additional information on the incremental inventory adjustments. 
 (4) Modification of stock awards for employees who were impacted by the Pivot which includes accelerating the vesting of any options or restricted stock units ("RSU's") that would have vested within six months of the employees termination date, and all vested options will be available for exercise for a total of six months after the employees termination date (that is, three month in addition to the standard three months per original agreement), which resulted in a decrease to equity based compensation expense of 0.3 million in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 11, Equity Based Compensation , for more information on the modification of stock awards. 
 Term Loan Amendment 
 On October 18, 2024, (the Sixth Amendment Effective Date ), the Company and Blue Torch entered into Amendment No. 6 to the Financing Agreement (the Sixth Amendment ), which amended the Company s existing Financing Agreement. The Sixth Amendment amends, among other things, certain terms of the Financing Agreement including without limitation, to (1) remove the minimum revenue financial covenant, (2) amend the minimum liquidity financial covenants, (3) include a minimum consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Financing Agreement) financial covenant, (4) increase the quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan over the remaining quarterly periods, payable in monthly installments, until the maturity of the Term Loan, and (5) amend certain financial definitions, reporting covenants and other covenants thereunder. 
 31 

In connection with the Sixth Amendment, on the Sixth Amendment Effective Date, the Company made partial prepayments on the Term Loan of 3.2 million (which amount was classified as a current obligation at September 30, 2024) along with the related prepayment premium of 2 on 2.0 million of the partial prepayments and accrued interest. The Company also incurred a 1 fee as paid in kind on the outstanding Term Loan balance prior to the prepayment (fee of 0.3 million). 
 In connection with the Sixth Amendment, the Company also amended and restated the Term Loan Warrants for the purchase of 97,482 shares of the Company s Class A common stock. The amendment of the Term Loan Warrants amends the exercise price from 9.16 per share to 6.26 per share. 
 See Note 15, Subsequent Events , for additional information on the Sixth Amendment and amendments to the Term Loan Warrants .

(1) Please see Non-GAAP Information below for a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA and an explanation for why we consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a helpful metric for investors. 
 Digital Subscriptions 
 Our ability to expand the number of digital subscriptions is an indicator of our market penetration and growth. Digital subscriptions include BOD (through March 2023) and BODi. Digital subscriptions include paid and free-to-pay subscriptions, with free-to-pay subscriptions representing less than 1 of total digital subscriptions on average. Digital subscriptions are inclusive of all billing plans, currently for annual, semi-annual, quarterly and monthly billing intervals. 
 Nutritional Subscriptions 
 Nutritional subscriptions include monthly subscriptions for nutritional products such as Shakeology, Beachbody Performance and BEACHBAR. We also package and bundle the content experience of digital subscriptions with nutritional subscriptions to optimize customer results. 
 Average Digital Retention 
 We use month-over-month digital subscription retention, which is defined as the average rate at which the total subscriber file is retained for the next period, to measure customer retention. For instance, a 95 average digital retention rate would correspond with retaining each month an average of 95 of digital subscribers existing at the beginning of that month. A 95 average digital retention rate would 
 32 

translate into a loss at the end of the quarter of approximately 15 of the subscribers existing at the beginning of the quarter. This calculation excludes new customer acquisitions or subscribers added in a specific month, so this calculation can never exceed 100 . 
 Total Streams 
 We use total streams to quantify the number of fitness, nutrition and mindset programs viewed, which is an indicator of customer engagement and retention. While the measure of a digital stream may vary across companies, to qualify as a stream on any of our digital platforms, a program must be viewed for a minimum of 25 of the total running time. 
 Daily Active Users to Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU) 
 We use the ratio of daily active users to monthly active users to measure how frequently digital subscribers are utilizing our service in a given month. We define a daily active user as a unique user streaming content on our platform in a given day. We define a monthly active user as a unique user streaming content on our platform in that same month. 
 Non-GAAP Information 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP performance measure, to supplement our results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance, as it is similar to measures reported by our public competitors and is regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a substitute for any GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry. 
 We define and calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for depreciation and amortization, amortization of capitalized cloud computing implementation costs, amortization of content assets, interest expense, income tax provision, equity-based compensation, restructuring costs, and other items that are not normal, recurring, operating expenses necessary to operate the Company s business as described in the reconciliation below. 
 
 We include this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by management to evaluate BODi s core operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses that are required in accordance with GAAP because they are non-cash (for example, in the case of depreciation and amortization and equity-based compensation) or are not related to our underlying business performance (for example, in the case of restructuring costs, interest income and expense). 
 The table below presents our Adjusted EBITDA reconciled to our net loss, the closest GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:

(4) The non-cash charge for employee incentives which were expected to be settled in equity was recorded and included in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation during the year ended December 31, 2022. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we reclassified the non-cash charge from employee incentives expected to be settled in equity to equity-based compensation because we settled certain employee incentives with RSU awards during the period.

Revenue 
 Revenue includes digital subscriptions, digital program sales, nutritional supplement subscriptions, one-time nutritional sales, connected fitness products, access to our online Partner business management platform, preferred customer program memberships, and other fitness-related products. We often sell bundled products that combine digital subscriptions, nutritional products, and/or other fitness products. We consider these sales to be revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations and allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price. We defer revenue when we receive payments in advance of delivery of products or the performance of services. Digital subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period of up to 38 months.

The decrease in digital revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to a 9.6 million decrease in revenue from our digital streaming services due to 20 fewer subscriptions on lower demand partially offset by the transition of all digital subscriptions to the higher priced BODi subscription over the past year, a decrease of 0.8 million in fees from Partners as there was a 27 decrease in the number of Partners and a decrease in digital program sales of 0.4 million. With the Pivot and the transition from an MLM model to an affiliate model, the Company will no longer receive fees from Partners beginning as of November 1, 2024.

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 32.3 million. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was 9.3 million and (14.6) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period, was primarily due to a decrease in net loss of 50.5 million, an increase in cash provided by other assets of 15.7 million and a decrease in cash used for accrued expenses of 12.0 million partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by deferred revenue of 13.3 million, a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of 12.6 million, a decrease in cash provided by inventory of 7.7 million, a decrease in provision for inventory and inventory purchase commitments of 6.6 million, a decrease in cash provided by equity based compensation of 6.5 million and in increase in cash used in other liabilities of 4.2 million. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was 1.6 million and (9.7) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities was due to proceeds received from the sale of the Van Nuys facility of 5.6 million and a decrease in capital expenditures of 1.5 million due to increased focus by management on capital expenditures, in particular related to technology. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 11.8 million and 17.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in debt repayments on our Term Loan in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 On August 8, 2022, the Company, Beachbody, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company (the Borrower ), and certain subsidiaries of the Company (together with the Company, the Guarantors ), entered into a financing agreement (as amended, the Financing Agreement with the lenders party thereto and Blue Torch Finance, LLC, ("Blue Torch") as administrative agent and collateral agent for such lenders, providing for a senior secured term loan facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of 50.0 million (the Term Loan ). Obligations under the Financing Agreement are guaranteed by the Guarantors, and secured by a lien on and security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and the Guarantors (together with the Borrower, the Loan Parties ), subject to customary exceptions. On July 24, 2023, the Company and Blue Torch entered into the Second Amendment. In connection with the Second Amendment, on the Second Amendment Effective Date, the Company made a partial prepayment on the Term Loan of 15.0 million. On January 9, 2024, February 29, 2024 and April 5, 2024, the Company made partial prepayments of 1.0 million, 5.5 million and 4.0 million, respectively, on the Term Loan in connection with the Third, Fourth and Fifth Amendments. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balance outstanding (including capitalized paid in kind interest) under the Term Loan was 25.3 million. On October 18, 2024, the Company and Blue Torch entered into the Sixth Amendment. In connection with the Sixth Amendment, on the Sixth Amendment Effective Date, the Company made partial prepayments on the Term Loan of 3.2 million (which was classified as a current obligation at September 30, 2024). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Term Loan was a secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR") loan, with an effective interest rate of 23.35 and a cash interest rate of 12.77 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Financing Agreement contains financial covenants, customary representations, warranties, covenants and customary events of default. In particular, the Financing Agreement contains a minimum liquidity financial covenant of 18.0 million as of September 30, 2024, which was amended in the Sixth Amendment to (a) 9.5 million from the Sixth Amendment Effective Date through December 
 43 

31, 2024 and (b) 13.0 million from January 1, 2025 to the maturity of the Term Loan. We were in compliance with the financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. See Note 15, Subsequent Events , for additional information on the amendments to the Term Loan including amendments to the financial covenants. We expect to remain in compliance with the amended financial covenants based on our current expectation of future results of operations. Unexpected weakness in the demand for our products may interfere with our ability to remain in compliance with the amended covenants, in particular the minimum liquidity financial covenant for which the cushion in passing is expected to narrow in upcoming quarters. Failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under the Financing Agreement, would constitute a condition of default and would allow Blue Torch to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the Financing Agreement. If such acceleration were to occur, we would likely have to seek an amendment and/or waiver of the impacted financial covenant or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, or asset sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend the Financing Agreement or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturity is accelerated. See Note 9, Debt , and Note 15, Subsequent Events , for additional information on the Term Loan. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have 19.2 million of lease obligations and purchase commitments associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies , for discussion of our contractual commitments that are primarily due within the next year. 
 
 Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth and overall economic conditions. We continue to assess and efficiently manage our working capital and expect to generate additional liquidity through continued cost control initiatives. We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and cost control initiatives will provide the Company with sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated cash needs, including debt service requirements, for the next twelve months as well as for the longer-term (i.e., beyond the next twelve months). 
 
 We may explore additional debt or equity financing to supplement our anticipated working capital balances and further strengthen our financial position, but do not at this time know which form it will take or what the terms will be. The incurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our shareholders. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K in Item 7 under the heading Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates other than noted below. 
 
 Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment 
 
 Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized, but instead are assessed for impairment annually at December 31 and between annual tests if an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit ("RU") below its carrying value or indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. We carry our definite-lived intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortization. If an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable, we would evaluate our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment at that time. 
 
 We test goodwill for impairment at a level within the Company referred to as the RU. Due to the continued sustained decline in our market capitalization in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the impact of the Pivot, which was approved by the Board of Directors of the Company in late September 2024, the Company performed an interim test for impairment of its goodwill as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 In performing the interim impairment test for goodwill, the Company elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment test and proceeded to perform a quantitative test by comparing the carrying value of its RU to its estimated fair value. The Company previously tested its RU for impairment as of December 31, 2023. Fair value is estimated using a combination of a market approach and an income approach, with significant assumptions related to guideline company financial multiples used in the market approach and significant assumptions about revenue growth, long-term growth rates and discount rates used in a discounted cash flow model in the income approach. The estimates used to determine fair value for the RU may change based on the results of operations, macro-economic conditions, stock price fluctuations or other factors. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment for the RU. As of September 30, 2024, management concluded that the fair value of its RU exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10 , or 5.6 million, resulting in no impairment. It is possible that our goodwill could become impaired 
 44 

if we determine in a subsequent period that the fair value of our RU was less than its carrying value which could result in a material charge and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 Due to reduced revenue and margin forecasts, we tested the related asset group for recoverability as of September 30, 2024. In testing for recoverability, we compared the carrying value of the asset group to its forecasted undiscounted cash flows to determine whether it was recoverable. The Company performed a test for recoverability at September 30, 2024 and concluded that the carrying value of its long-lived assets was recoverable. 
 
 Management will continue to monitor its RU and long-lived asset group for changes in the business environment that could impact its fair value. Examples of events or circumstances that could result in changes to the underlying key assumptions and judgments used in our goodwill impairment tests, and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our RU may include supply chain disruptions and demand for at-home fitness solutions; adverse macroeconomic conditions; volatility in the equity and debt markets which could result in higher weighted-average cost of capital and our subscriber growth rates. Changes in any of the assumptions used in the valuation of the RU, or changes in the business environment could materially affect the expected cash flows, and such impacts could potentially result in a material non-cash impairment charge. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for recently adopted accounting pronouncements. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to transactions in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, which is our functional currency. Our foreign subsidiaries, sales, certain inventory purchases and operating expenses expose us to foreign currency exchange risk. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 10 of our revenue was in foreign currencies. These sales were primarily denominated in Canadian dollars and British pounds. 
 We may use derivative instruments to manage the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our net cash flows. We primarily enter into option contracts to hedge forecasted payments, typically for up to 12 months, for cost of revenue, selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses and intercompany transactions not denominated in the local currencies of our foreign operations. We designate some of these instruments as cash flow hedges and record them at fair value as either assets or liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. Some of these instruments are freestanding derivatives for which hedge accounting does not apply. 
 
 In the year ended December 31, 2023, management made a determination to cease entering into any further foreign exchange options at this time, which resulted in a decrease in the notional amount of the Company's outstanding foreign exchange options to zero at September 30, 2024 as all of the foreign exchange options expired prior to March 31, 2024. As part of the Pivot, the Company has decided to exit the sale of nutritional and other physical products in the United Kingdom (the "UK") and France. Nutrition and other revenue in the UK and France is not significant. 
 Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of third-party payments are recognized in cost of revenue, selling and marketing or general and administrative expenses, as applicable, during the period when the hedged underlying transaction affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of certain derivatives for which hedge accounting does not apply are immediately recognized directly in earnings to cost of revenue. 
 A hypothetical 10 change in exchange rates, with the U.S. dollar as the functional and reporting currency, would result in an approximate 2.8 million increase or decrease in cost of revenue and operating expenses. The higher exposure to changes in foreign currency from previous periods was due to management's decision to cease entering into foreign exchange options at this time. 
 The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange derivative instruments at September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023 was zero and 4.4 million, respectively.

Item 4. Co ntrols and Procedures. 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, as specified above. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. 
 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Le gal Proceedings. 
 We are and, from time to time, we may become, involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the information previously reported under Part I, Item 3 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 On May 22, 2023, Jessica Lyons, an individual, and a group of other plaintiffs filed a class action complaint with the Los Angeles County Superior Court alleging that the Company misclassified its Partners as contractors rather than as employees and committed other violations of the California Labor Code. The Company understands that the plaintiffs in this matter intend on filing additional claims under the Private Attorney General Act of 2004. The Company and certain executive officers are listed as defendants in the complaint. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages. The Company filed a motion to compel arbitration in the case. The firm representing Ms. Lyons has also filed 13 arbitration actions in Los Angeles County in anticipation that the Company's motion to compel arbitration will be upheld. All arbitration proceedings have been stayed pending the outcome of the mediation and follow-up discussions. This matter is pending as of the date of this quarterly report. We deny the allegations in the complaint, believe they are without merit, and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this action. 
 
 On September 6, 2023 Dish Technologies LLC and SLING TV LLC (the "DISH Entities") filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company infringed on the DISH Entities' patents and used technology belonging to the DISH Entities without their permission. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In an effort to avoid any further unnecessary litigation costs, the parties entered into a Confidential Standstill and Tolling Agreement as of April 16, 2024 which included a dismissal of the case by the DISH Entities without prejudice and an agreement by the DISH Entities not to institute any litigation proceedings against the Company under the patents any earlier than December 31, 2026 in exchange for a one-time immaterial payment to the DISH Entities by the Company. 
 
 On June 14, 2024, Bryan Reilly on behalf of himself and similarly situated current and former stockholders of Forest Road Acquisition Corp., which later became the Beachbody Company, Inc. Forest Road ), filed a verified class action complaint (the Reilly Action against the former directors and officers of Forest Road, as well as Forest Road Acquisition Sponsor LLC, Forest Road Company LLC, Zach Tarica, and Jeremy Tarica (together the Forest Road Sponsor Defendants alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the merger among Forest Road, The Beachbody Company, Inc., and Myx in 2021 (the Merger ). The lawsuit also brought claims against the Company, Kevin Meyer, and The Raine Group LLC Raine alleging aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and against the former Forest Road directors and officers, the Forest Road Sponsor Defendants, Raine, and Meyer for unjust enrichment. We also have certain indemnification obligations as to some or all of the former Forest Road directors and Raine as to certain claims. 
 
 The Reilly Action generally alleges that the proxy that Forest Road issued prior to the Merger contained numerous material misstatements and omissions that impaired the Forest Road stockholders ability to make an informed decision regarding whether to redeem their stock in connection with the Merger. The plaintiff also asserts that the Merger was a conflicted transaction because the Forest Road Sponsor Defendants and the former Forest Road directors were incentivized to close the Merger even if it was a value-decreasing transaction for 
 46 

Forest Road s public stockholders. As to the Company, Meyer, and Raine, the complaint alleges that these defendants aided and abetted the Forest Road defendants disclosure violations. We deny the allegations in the complaint, believe they are without merit, and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this action. 
 
 On October 14, 2024, the firm Milberg Coleman Bryson Phillips Grossman ("Milberg") filed 10 arbitration demands alleging that the Company violated the Video Privacy Protection Act. The arbitration demands state that Milberg currently represents approximately 6,239 additional subscribers of BODi and intends to file similar demands for each person. the plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages as well as injunctive and equitable relief. We deny the allegations in the complaint, believe they are without merit, and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this action. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 There have been no material developments with respect to the information previously reported under Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 other than as noted below. These risk factors describe some of the assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could adversely affect our business or that could otherwise result in changes that differ materially from our expectations. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 
 On September 30, 2024, we announced strategic initiatives to transition from our Multi-Level Marketing ("MLM") model to a single level affiliate model (the "Pivot"). As part of the Pivot, we will continue to execute an omni channel selling strategy including direct response marketing, retail partnerships and transition our direct selling channel from our current MLM model to a new business model focused on a single level affiliate model. 
 The announced Pivot involves numerous risks, including, but not limited to: 
 our current Partners may not choose to continue to partner with us as affiliates, or, if they do continue to partner with the Company, may not sell as much of our products; 

we may be unable to recruit new affiliates or be able to offer a competitive compensation plan for our affiliates; 

changes to our business model may be disruptive to our operations and may cause our revenues to decline or result in lower decreases to our expenses than expected; 

change to our business model may result in increased churn of the Company's subscriber base; 

the impact on our revenues as a result of the reduction or elimination of preferred customer membership fees and fees paid to the Company by its direct selling Partners; 

changes to commission rates in connection with the Pivot may result in unexpected fluctuations in our expenses; 

changes in our results of operations and financial position may result in our failure to comply with financial and other covenants contained in our existing and/or future debt agreements and may result in a default under our debt agreements; 

exposure to unknown, contingent or other liabilities, including litigation arising in connection with the Pivot; 

negative impacts on our business relationships, including relationships with our customers, suppliers, vendors, Partners and employees; 

difficulty retaining or recruiting officers, key employees or directors; 

material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting resulting from a reduced workforce, including members of our accounting and/or internal audit staff; and 

unintended negative consequences from changes to our business profile. 

If any of these or other factors impair our ability to successfully implement the Pivot, we may not be able to realize other business opportunities as we may be required to spend additional time and incur additional expenses related to the Pivot that otherwise would be used on the development and expansion of our business.
