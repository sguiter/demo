EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH 
 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 of Retail Opportunity Investments Corp., a Maryland corporation ROIC ), and Retail Opportunity Investments Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the Operating Partnership ), of which ROIC is the parent company and general partner. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to the Company, we, us, our, or our company refer to ROIC together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to the Operating Partnership refer to Retail Opportunity Investments Partnership, LP together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 ROIC operates as a real estate investment trust and as of September 30, 2024, ROIC owned an approximate 95.3 partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, ROIC s wholly-owned subsidiary, is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, and as the parent company, ROIC has the full and complete authority over the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management and control. 
 
 The Company believes that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of ROIC and the Operating Partnership into a single report will result in the following benefits: 
 
 facilitate a better understanding by the investors of ROIC and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 
 remove duplicative disclosures and provide a more straightforward presentation in light of the fact that a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both ROIC and the Operating Partnership; and 
 
 create time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 
 Management operates ROIC and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise. The management of ROIC and the Operating Partnership are the same. 
 
 There are a few differences between ROIC and the Operating Partnership, which are reflected in the disclosures in this report. The Company believes it is important to understand the differences between ROIC and the Operating Partnership in the context of how these entities operate as an interrelated consolidated company. ROIC is a real estate investment trust, whose only material asset is its ownership of direct or indirect partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and membership interest in Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, which is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As a result, ROIC does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the parent company of the Operating Partnership and issuing equity from time to time. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all the assets of the Company and directly or indirectly holds the ownership interests in the Company s real estate ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the Company s business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by ROIC, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the Company s business through the Operating Partnership s operations, by the Operating Partnership s incurrence of indebtedness (directly and through subsidiaries) or through the issuance of operating partnership units OP Units ). 
 
 Non-controlling interests is the primary area of difference between the Consolidated Financial Statements for ROIC and the Operating Partnership. The OP Units in the Operating Partnership that are not owned by ROIC are accounted for as partners capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements and as non-controlling interests in ROIC s financial statements. Accordingly, this report presents the Consolidated Financial Statements for ROIC and the Operating Partnership separately, as required, as well as Earnings Per Share / Earnings Per Unit and Capital of the Operating Partnership. 
 
 This report also includes separate Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources, Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer certifications for each of ROIC and the Operating Partnership as reflected in Exhibits 31 and 32.

of its REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains) and meets certain other qualifications prescribed by the Code, will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income that is distributed. Although it may qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company is subject to state income or franchise taxes in certain states in which some of its properties are located. For all periods from inception through September 26, 2013, the Operating Partnership had been an entity disregarded from its sole owner, ROIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes and as such had not been subject to U.S. federal income taxes. Effective September 27, 2013, the Operating Partnership issued OP Units in connection with the acquisitions of two shopping centers. Accordingly, the Operating Partnership ceased being a disregarded entity and instead is being treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 
 The Company follows the FASB guidance that defines a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The FASB also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company records interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as interest expense. As of September 30, 2024, the statute of limitations for the tax years 2020 through and including 2023 remain open for examination by the Internal Revenue Service IRS and state taxing authorities. 
 
 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of its net taxable income. ROIC intends to pay regular quarterly dividends to stockholders in an amount not less than its net taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by its board of directors. Before ROIC pays any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, it must first meet both its operating requirements and its debt service on debt. If ROIC s cash available for distribution is less than its net taxable income, it could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or it may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. The Company intends to continue to operate its business in a manner that will allow it to qualify as a REIT, including maintaining compliance with taxable income distribution requirements.

 OP Units outstanding. ROIC owned an approximate partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at September 30, 2024, or OP Units. The remaining OP Units are owned by other limited partners. A share of ROIC s common stock and an OP Unit have essentially the same economic characteristics as they share equally in the total net income or loss and distributions of the Operating Partnership. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, subject to certain exceptions, holders are able to redeem their OP Units for cash or, at ROIC s option, for shares of ROIC common stock on a one-for-one basis. If cash is paid in the redemption, the redemption price is equal to the average closing price on the NASDAQ Stock Market for shares of ROIC s common stock over the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date a redemption notice is received by ROIC. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, ROIC received notices of redemption for a total of OP Units. ROIC elected to redeem the OP Units for shares of ROIC common stock on a one-for-one basis, and accordingly, shares of ROIC common stock were issued. 
 
 The redemption value of outstanding OP Units owned by the limited partners as of September 30, 2024, not including ROIC, had such units been redeemed at September 30, 2024, was approximately million, calculated based on the average closing price of ROIC s common stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding September 30, 2024, which amounted to per share. 
 
 Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, ROIC s wholly-owned subsidiary, is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, and as the parent company, ROIC has the full and complete authority over the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management and control. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, ROIC effectively controls the ability to issue common stock of ROIC upon redemption of any OP Units. The redemption provisions that permit ROIC to settle the redemption of OP Units in either cash or common stock, in the sole discretion of ROIC, are further evaluated in accordance with applicable accounting guidance to determine whether temporary or permanent equity classification on the balance sheet is appropriate. The Company evaluated this guidance, including the ability, in its sole discretion, to settle in unregistered shares of common stock, and determined that the OP Units meet the requirements to qualify for presentation as permanent equity.

The Company s outstanding mortgage note payable was estimated to have a fair value of approximately million with a weighted average interest rate of as of September 30, 2024. This fair value measurement falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Derivative and Hedging Activities 
 
 The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company has historically used interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. 
 
 The changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified into earnings during the period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. 
 
 The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of the derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivative, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, and implied volatilities.

Overview 
 
 Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. ROIC is organized in an UpREIT format pursuant to which Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiary, serves as the general partner of, and ROIC conducts substantially all of its business through, its operating partnership, Retail Opportunity Investments Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the Operating Partnership ), together with its subsidiaries. ROIC reincorporated as a Maryland corporation on June 2, 2011. ROIC has elected to be taxed as a REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with the year ended December 31, 2010. 
 
 ROIC commenced operations in October 2009 as a fully integrated and self-managed REIT, and as of September 30, 2024, ROIC owned an approximate 95.3 partnership interest and other limited partners owned the remaining approximate 4.7 partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. ROIC specializes in the acquisition, ownership and management of necessity-based community and neighborhood shopping centers on the west coast of the United States, anchored by supermarkets and drugstores. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s portfolio consisted of 94 properties (93 retail and one office) totaling approximately 10.6 million square feet of gross leasable area GLA ). As of September 30, 2024, the Company s retail portfolio, excluding one shopping center that is currently planned for redevelopment and is no longer being managed as a retail asset, was approximately 97.1 leased. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company leased or renewed a total of approximately 1.2 million square feet in its portfolio. The Company has committed approximately 13.3 million, or 48.93 per square foot, in tenant improvements, including building and site improvements, for new leases that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company has committed approximately 1.0 million, or 3.72 per square foot, in leasing commissions, for new leases that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company has committed approximately 3.6 million, or 3.76 per square foot, in tenant improvements, including building and site improvements, for renewed leases that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Leasing commission commitments for renewed leases were not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Property operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. The Company defines property operating income as operating revenues (rental revenue and other income), less property and related expenses (property operating expenses and property taxes). Property operating income excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, acquisition transaction costs, other expense, interest expense, gains and losses from property acquisitions and dispositions, equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures, and extraordinary items. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating property operating income, and accordingly, the Company s property operating income may not be comparable to other REITs. 
 
 Property operating income is used by management to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the Company s properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of the Company s properties as this measure is not affected by the cost of the Company s funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to the ownership of its properties. The Company believes the exclusion of these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the Company s properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. 
 
 Property operating income is a measure of the operating performance of the Company s properties but does not measure the Company s performance as a whole. Property operating income is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated property operating income of approximately 182.3 million compared to property operating income of approximately 175.4 million generated during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of approximately 6.9 million. The property operating income for the 90 same-center properties increased approximately 4.6 million primarily due to the accelerated recognition of a below-market lease intangible liability during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 4.2 million resulting from an anchor lease that expired, an increase in base rents driven by contractual rent increases and re-leasing spreads and a decrease in estimated uncollectible revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These fluctuations were offset by a decrease in early lease termination fee and lease settlement income received and a decrease in straight-line rental income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The property operating income for the non same-center properties increased approximately 2.3 million primarily due to the timing of acquisitions and dispositions during 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 
 The Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 78.5 million compared to approximately 77.3 million incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 General and administrative expenses 
 
 The Company incurred general and administrative expenses of approximately 17.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 16.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses increased approximately 735,000 primarily as a result of an increase in compensation-related expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Gain on sale of real estate 
 
 On July 17, 2024, the Company sold the property known as Marketplace Del Rio, a shopping center located in Oceanside, California. The sales price of 56.6 million, less costs to sell, resulted in net proceeds of approximately 54.9 million. The Company recorded a gain on sale of real estate of approximately 22.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to this property disposition. On August 27, 2024, the Company sold the property known as PCC Community Markets Plaza, a single tenant property located in Edmonds, Washington. The sales price of approximately 12.2 million, less costs to sell, resulted in net proceeds of approximately 11.5 million. The Company recorded a gain on sale of real estate of approximately 4.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to this property disposition. There were no property sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest expense and other finance expenses 
 
 The Company incurred interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 58.9 million compared to approximately 52.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense increased approximately 6.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the net increase in interest 
 - 32 - 

expense incurred on the Company s Senior Notes and an increase in the amounts outstanding under the credit facility as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Funds From Operations 
 
 Funds from operations FFO ), is a widely-recognized non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that the Company believes when considered with financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, provides additional and useful means to assess its financial performance. FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the performance of REITs, most of which present FFO along with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 The Company computes FFO in accordance with the White Paper on FFO published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), which defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring, sales of depreciable property, and impairments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for partnerships and unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 
 However, FFO: 
 
 does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income); and 
 
 should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company s performance. 
 
 FFO as defined by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported by other REITs due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. 
 
 The table below provides a reconciliation of net income applicable to stockholders in accordance with GAAP to FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Cash Net Operating Income NOI 
 
 Cash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company s performance. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is operating income. The Company defines cash NOI as operating revenues (rental revenue and other income), less property and related expenses (property operating expenses and property taxes), adjusted for non-cash revenue and operating expense items such as straight-line rent and amortization of lease intangibles, debt-related expenses, and other adjustments. Cash NOI also excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, acquisition transaction costs, other expense, interest expense, gains and losses from property acquisitions and dispositions, equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures, and extraordinary items. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating cash NOI, and accordingly, the Company s cash NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. 
 
 Cash NOI is used by management internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the Company s properties. The Company believes cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the Company s financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those cash income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, can be used to determine trends in earnings of the Company s properties as this measure is not affected by non-cash revenue and expense recognition items, the cost of the Company s funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to the Company s ownership of properties. The Company believes the exclusion 
 - 33 - 

of these items from operating income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the Company s properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. 
 
 Cash NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the Company s properties but does not measure the Company s performance as a whole and is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP. 

Same-Center Cash NOI 
 
 The table below provides a reconciliation of same-center cash NOI to consolidated operating income in accordance with GAAP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The table makes reference to the effect of the same-center properties. Same-center properties, which totaled 90 of the Company s 94 properties for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, represent all operating properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both periods presented and consolidated into the Company s financial statements during such periods, except for the Company s corporate headquarters and one property that is currently planned for redevelopment and is no longer being managed as a retail asset (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 GAAP operating income 53,858 26,927 112,284 80,732 Depreciation and amortization 25,918 27,050 78,518 77,280 General and administrative expenses 5,959 5,492 17,323 16,588 Other expense 158 157 815 811 Gain on sale of real estate (26,656) (26,656) Straight-line rent 177 (362) (246) (1,688) Amortization of above-market and below-market rent, net (2,644) (2,118) (11,965) (7,591) Property revenues and other expenses (1)

 ______________________ 
 (1) Includes anchor lease termination fees, net of contractual amounts, if any, expense and recovery adjustments related to prior periods and other miscellaneous adjustments. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated same-center cash NOI of approximately 54.3 million compared to approximately 55.4 million generated during the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a 2.1 decrease. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in early lease termination fee and lease settlement income received during the three months ended September 30, 2024, offset by an increase in base rents driven by contractual rent increases and re-leasing spreads during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated same-center cash NOI of approximately 163.3 million compared to same-center cash NOI of approximately 160.9 million generated during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a 1.5 increase. This increase is primarily due to an increase in base rents driven by contractual rent increases and re-leasing spreads and a decrease in estimated uncollectible revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, offset by a decrease in early lease termination fee and lease settlement income received during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. This summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Company s accounting policies included in Note 1 to the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

- 34 - 

Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company records base rents on a straight-line basis over the term of each lease. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in Tenant and other receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Most leases contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro-rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area expenses. Adjustments are also made throughout the year to tenant and other receivables and the related cost recovery income based upon the Company s best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 
 The allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on a quarterly analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts. The analysis places particular emphasis on past-due accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivables, tenant creditworthiness, current economic trends, the payment history of the tenants or other debtors, the financial condition of the tenants and any guarantors and management s assessment of their ability to meet their lease obligations, the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations, among other things. 
 
 Management s estimates of the required allowance are subject to revision as these factors change and are sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on tenants, particularly those at retail properties. Estimates are used to establish reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate tax and insurance costs. The Company analyzes the balance of its estimated accounts receivable for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance for each of its properties by comparing actual recoveries versus actual expenses and any actual write-offs. Based on its analysis, the Company may record an additional amount in its allowance for doubtful accounts related to these items. In addition, the Company also provides an allowance for future credit losses in connection with the deferred straight-line rent receivable. 

Real Estate Investments 
 
 Land, buildings, property improvements, furniture/fixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Renovations and/or replacements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful lives. 
 
 The Company recognizes the acquisition of real estate properties, including acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, buildings and improvements) and acquired intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above-market and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases) at their relative fair value (for acquisitions not meeting the definition of a business) and fair value (for acquisitions meeting the definition of a business). The relative fair values used to allocate the cost of an asset acquisition are determined using the same methodologies and assumptions the Company utilizes to determine fair values in a business combination. Acquired lease intangible assets include above-market leases and acquired in-place leases, and Acquired lease intangible liabilities represent below-market leases in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, which value is then allocated to land, buildings and improvements based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets. In valuing an acquired property s intangibles, factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods based on its evaluation of current market demand. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related costs. 
 
 The value of in-place leases is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates, over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as if it were vacant. Above-market and below-market lease values are recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be received and management s estimate of market lease rates, measured over the terms of the respective leases that management deemed appropriate at the time of acquisition. Such valuations include a consideration of the non-cancellable terms of the respective leases as well as any applicable renewal periods. The fair values associated with below-market rental renewal options are determined based on the Company s experience and the relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the acquisitions. The value of the above-market and below-market leases associated with the original lease term and option period, if applicable, is amortized to Rental revenue over the terms of the respective leases including applicable option periods. The value of in-place leases is amortized to Depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be recognized in operations at that time. 
 
 - 35 - 

The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful life of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation. These assessments have a direct impact on the Company s net income. 
 
 Properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
 Buildings (years) 39 40 Property Improvements (years) 10 20 Furniture/Fixtures (years) 3 10 Tenant Improvements Shorter of lease term or its useful life 

Asset Impairment 
 
 The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to aggregate future net cash flows (undiscounted and without interest) expected to be generated by the asset. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, legal and environmental concerns, the Company s intent and ability to hold the related asset, as well as any significant cost overruns on development properties. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value. Management does not believe that the value of any of the Company s real estate investments was impaired at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

REIT Qualification Requirements 
 
 The Company has elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, and believes that it has been organized and has operated in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. 
 
 The Company is subject to a number of operational and organizational requirements to qualify and then maintain qualification as a REIT. If the Company does not qualify as a REIT, its income would become subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates that would be substantial and the Company may not be permitted to re-elect to qualify as a REIT for four taxable years following the year that it failed to qualify as a REIT. The Company s results of operations, liquidity and amounts distributable to stockholders would be significantly reduced if it failed to qualify as a REIT. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company 
 
 In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company section and in the Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership section, the term the Company refers to Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding the Operating Partnership. 
 
 The Company s business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership, of which the Company is the parent company and which it consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Because the Company operates on a consolidated basis with the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole. 
 
 The Company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company. The Company itself does not hold any indebtedness other than guarantees of indebtedness of the Operating Partnership, and its only material assets are its ownership of direct or indirect partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and membership interest in Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. However, all debt is held directly or indirectly by the Operating Partnership. The Company s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock. The Company s principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership. 
 
 As the parent company of the Operating Partnership, the Company, indirectly, has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management and control. The Company causes the Operating 
 - 36 - 

Partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as the Company may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement. 
 
 The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with an effective shelf registration statement filed in April 2022 that allows the Company to register unspecified various classes of debt and equity securities. As circumstances warrant, the Company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. Any proceeds from such equity issuances would be contributed to the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to acquire additional properties, pay down debt, and for general working capital purposes. 
 
 Liquidity is a measure of the Company s ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain its assets and operations, make distributions to its stockholders and meet other general business needs. The liquidity of the Company is dependent on the Operating Partnership s ability to make sufficient distributions to the Company. The primary cash requirement of the Company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s primary source of cash was distributions from the Operating Partnership. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has determined that it has adequate working capital to meet its dividend funding obligations for the next twelve months. 
 
 On February 20, 2020, ROIC entered into an at the market sales agreement, as amended on April 27, 2022 (the Sales Agreement ), with each of (i) KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., BTIG, LLC, BMO Capital Markets Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., Capital One Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Jefferies LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Raymond James Associates, Inc., Regions Securities LLC, Robert W. Baird Co. Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (collectively, the Agents and (ii) the Forward Purchasers (as defined below), pursuant to which ROIC may sell, from time to time, shares (any such shares, the Primary Shares of ROIC s common stock, par value 0.0001 per share Common Stock ), to or through the Agents and instruct certain of the Agents, acting as forward sellers (the Forward Sellers ), to offer and sell borrowed shares (any such shares, Forward Hedge Shares, and collectively with the Primary Shares, the Shares with the Shares to be sold under the Sales Agreement having an aggregate offering price of up to 500.0 million. 
 
 The Sales Agreement contemplates that, in addition to the issuance and sale of Primary Shares to or through the Agents as principal or its sales agents, ROIC may enter into separate forward sale agreements with any of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., BMO Capital Markets Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Jefferies LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Raymond James Associates, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC or their respective affiliates (in such capacity, the Forward Purchasers ). If ROIC enters into a forward sale agreement with any Forward Purchaser, ROIC expects that such Forward Purchaser or its affiliate will borrow from third parties and, through the relevant Forward Seller, sell a number of Forward Hedge Shares equal to the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the particular forward sale agreement, in accordance with the mutually accepted instructions related to such forward sale agreement. ROIC will not initially receive any proceeds from any sale of Forward Hedge Shares through a Forward Seller. ROIC expects to fully physically settle each particular forward sale agreement with the relevant Forward Purchaser on one or more dates specified by ROIC on or prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement by issuing shares of Common Stock, in which case ROIC expects to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the particular forward sale agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. However, ROIC may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a particular forward sale agreement, in which case ROIC may not receive any proceeds from the issuance of shares of Common Stock, and ROIC will instead receive or pay cash (in the case of cash settlement) or receive or deliver shares of Common Stock (in the case of net share settlement). 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, ROIC did not sell any shares under the Sales Agreement. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, dividends paid to stockholders totaled approximately 57.6 million. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, distributions paid from the Operating Partnership to the non-controlling interest holders of OP Units OP Unitholders totaled approximately 3.3 million. On a consolidated basis, cash flows from operations for the same period totaled approximately 121.7 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, dividends paid and payable to stockholders totaled approximately 57.6 million. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, distributions paid and payable from the Operating Partnership to the OP Unitholders totaled approximately 3.7 million. On a consolidated basis, cash flows from operations for the same period totaled approximately 124.3 million. 
 
 Potential future sources of capital include equity issuances and distributions from the Operating Partnership.

Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership 
 
 In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership section, the terms the Operating Partnership, we , our and us refer to the Operating Partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries or the Operating Partnership and the Company together with their respective consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership s primary sources of cash were cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sale of real estate, and proceeds from borrowings under the credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership has determined that it has adequate working capital to meet its debt obligations and operating expenses for the next twelve months. 
 
 The Operating Partnership has an unsecured term loan (the term loan with several banks acting as lenders. Effective March 2, 2023, the Operating Partnership entered into a Third Amendment to the First Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement, dated as of September 8, 2017, as amended (the Term Loan Agreement ). Under the Term Loan Agreement, the lenders agreed to provide 300.0 million of unsecured borrowings. The maturity date of the term loan is January 20, 2025, without further options for extension. The Term Loan Agreement also provides that the Operating Partnership may from time to time request increased aggregate commitments of 200.0 million if certain conditions are met, including the consent of the lenders to the additional commitments. Additionally, the Operating Partnership has an unsecured revolving credit facility (the credit facility with several banks. Effective March 2, 2023, the Operating Partnership entered into a Third Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 8, 2017, (as amended, the Credit Facility Agreement ). Under the Credit Facility Agreement, the Operating Partnership has borrowing capacity of up to 600.0 million. The maturity date under the Credit Facility Agreement is March 2, 2027, with two six-month extension options, which may be exercised by the Operating Partnership upon satisfaction of certain conditions including the payment of extension fees. Additionally, the Credit Facility Agreement contains an accordion feature, which allows the Operating Partnership to increase the borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility Agreement up to an aggregate of 1.2 billion, subject to lender consents and other conditions. Refer to Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for certain quantitative details related to the interest accrual calculations on outstanding principal amounts for both the Term Loan Agreement and Credit Facility Agreement. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 200.0 million and 135.0 million were outstanding under the term loan and credit facility, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the term loan during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.4 . As discussed in Note 9 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Operating Partnership has historically used interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk. The Company s two interest rate swaps matured effective August 31, 2024, and accordingly, the interest rate on a portion of the term loan was no longer effectively fixed and outstanding borrowings under the term loan became subject to a variable interest rate, as detailed above, effective September 1, 2024. The weighted average interest rate on the credit facility during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.3 . The Operating Partnership had no amounts available to borrow under the term loan at September 30, 2024. The Operating Partnership had approximately 465.0 million available to borrow under the credit facility at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Further, the Operating Partnership issued 350.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in September 2023 (the Senior Notes Due 2028 ), 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in December 2017 (the Senior Notes Due 2027 ), 200.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in September 2016 (the Senior Notes Due 2026 ), and 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in December 2014 (the Senior Notes Due 2024 and collectively with the Senior Notes Due 2026, the Senior Notes Due 2027 and the Senior Notes Due 2028, the Senior Notes ), each of which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ROIC.

 The Operating Partnership s material current and long-term cash requirements are further described below. 
 
 The Operating Partnership s debt agreements contain customary representations, financial and other covenants, and its ability to borrow under these agreements is subject to its compliance with financial covenants and other restrictions on an ongoing basis. The Operating Partnership was in compliance with such covenants at September 30, 2024. 
 
 While the Operating Partnership generally intends to hold its assets as long term investments, certain of its investments may be sold in order to manage the Operating Partnership s interest rate risk and liquidity needs, meet other operating objectives and adapt to market conditions. The timing and impact of future sales of its investments, if any, cannot be predicted with any certainty. 
 
 The Company has investment grade credit ratings from Moody s Investors Service (Baa2), S P Global Ratings (BBB-) and Fitch Ratings (BBB). 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in the Company s consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net Cash Provided by (Used in): Operating Activities 121,670 124,258 Investing Activities (37,612) (32,491) Financing Activities (31,138) 108,286 
 
 Net Cash Flows from: 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to approximately 121.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 124.3 million in the comparable period in 2023. This decrease of approximately 2.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to an increase in interest expense and the timing of collections and payments of working capital accounts. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows used in investing activities amounted to approximately 37.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 32.5 million in the comparable period in 2023. This increase of approximately 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the increase in investments in real estate of approximately 71.1 million, offset by the increase in proceeds from the sale of real estate of approximately 66.4 million. 
 
 - 39 - 

Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows used in financing activities amounted to approximately 31.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of approximately 108.3 million in the comparable period in 2023. This increase in cash flows used in financing activities of approximately 139.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from the issuance of unsecured senior notes of approximately 348.3 million, an increase in principal repayments on mortgages of approximately 26.0 million related to the Fullerton Crossroads mortgage note repayment and an increase in dividends and distributions paid to common stockholders and OP Unitholders of approximately 20.7 million. These fluctuations were offset by the net borrowings on the credit facility of 60.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the net pay downs on the credit facility of 88.0 million in the comparative period in 2023, the paydown on the term loan of 100.0 million in 2023 and a decrease in deferred financing costs of approximately 7.9 million related to the Credit Facility Agreement and issuance of Senior Notes. 

Material Cash Requirements 
 
 The following table represents the Company s known contractual and other short-term (i.e., the next twelve months) and long-term (i.e., beyond the next twelve months) obligations as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

 (1) The floating rate term loan accrues interest at the current rate of 6.3 as of September 30, 2024. 
 (2) The floating rate credit facility accrues interest at the current rate of 6.1 as of September 30, 2024. 
 (3) Represents payments of interest only in the short-term and payments of both principal and interest in the long-term. 
 (4) Represents payments of both principal and interest in the short-term. 
 
 The short-term and long-term liquidity requirements of the Company, including the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, consist primarily of the material cash requirements set forth above, dividends expected to be paid to the Company s stockholders, capital expenditures and capital required for acquisitions. 
 
 The Company, including the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, plans to satisfy its short-term liquidity requirements, including its material cash requirements, through operating cash flows, debt refinancings, potential asset sales and/or borrowings under the credit facility. 
 
 Historically, the Company, including the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, has financed its long-term liquidity requirements through operating cash flows, borrowings under the credit facility and term loan, debt refinancings, new debt, equity offerings and other capital market transactions, and/or the disposition of assets. The Company expects to continue doing so in the future. However, there can be no assurance that these sources will always be available to the Company when needed, or on terms the Company desires or that the future requirements of the Company will not be materially higher than the Company currently expects. 
 
 The Company has committed approximately 16.9 million and 1.1 million in tenant improvements (including building and site improvements) and leasing commissions, respectively, for the new leases and renewals that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 - 40 - 

Real Estate Taxes 
 
 The Company s leases generally require the tenants to be responsible for a pro-rata portion of the real estate taxes. 

Inflation 
 
 The Company s long-term leases contain provisions to help manage the adverse impact of inflation on its operating results. Such provisions include clauses entitling the Company to receive (a) scheduled base rent increases and (b) percentage rents based upon tenants gross sales which generally increase as prices rise. In addition, many of the Company s non-anchor leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits the Company to seek increases in rents upon renewal at then-current market rates if rents provided in the expiring leases are below then-existing market rates. Most of the Company s leases require tenants to pay a share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing the Company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. 

Leverage Policies 
 
 The Company employs prudent amounts of leverage and uses debt as a means of providing additional funds for the acquisition of its properties and the diversification of its portfolio. The Company seeks to primarily utilize unsecured debt in order to maintain liquidity and flexibility in its capital structure. 
 
 Under the Term Loan Agreement, several banks acting as lenders agreed to provide 300.0 million of unsecured borrowings. The maturity date of the term loan is January 20, 2025, without further options for extension. The Term Loan Agreement also provides that the Operating Partnership may from time to time request increased aggregate commitments of 200.0 million under certain conditions set forth in the Term Loan Agreement, including the consent of the lenders to the additional commitments. 
 
 Under the Credit Facility Agreement, the Operating Partnership has borrowing capacity on the credit facility of up to 600.0 million. The maturity date under the Credit Facility Agreement is March 2, 2027, with two six-month extension options, which may be exercised by the Operating Partnership upon satisfaction of certain conditions including the payment of extension fees. Additionally, the Credit Facility Agreement contains an accordion feature, which allows the Operating Partnership to increase the borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility Agreement up to an aggregate of 1.2 billion, subject to lender consents and other conditions. 
 
 Further, the Operating Partnership issued 350.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in September 2023, 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in each of December 2017 and December 2014 and 200.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in September 2016, each of which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. 
 
 The Company may borrow on a non-recourse basis at the corporate level or Operating Partnership level. Non-recourse indebtedness means the indebtedness of the borrower or its subsidiaries is secured only by specific assets without recourse to other assets of the borrower or any of its subsidiaries. Even with non-recourse indebtedness, however, a borrower or its subsidiaries will likely be required to guarantee against certain breaches of representations and warranties such as those relating to the absence of fraud, misappropriation, misapplication of funds, environmental conditions and material misrepresentations. Because non-recourse financing generally restricts the lender s claim on the assets of the borrower, the lender generally may only proceed against the asset securing the debt. This may protect the Company s other assets. 
 
 The Company plans to evaluate each investment opportunity and determine the appropriate leverage on a case-by-case basis and also on a Company-wide basis. The Company may seek to refinance indebtedness, such as when a decline in interest rates makes it beneficial to prepay an existing mortgage, when an existing mortgage matures or if an attractive investment becomes available and the proceeds from the refinancing can be used to purchase the investment. 
 
 The Company plans to finance future acquisitions through a combination of cash from operations, borrowings under the credit facility, the assumption of existing mortgage debt, the issuance of OP Units, equity and debt offerings, and the potential sale of existing assets. In addition, the Company may acquire retail properties indirectly through joint ventures with third parties as a means of increasing the funds available for the acquisition of properties. 
 
 - 41 - 

Distributions 
 
 The Operating Partnership and ROIC intend to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of their OP Units and common stock, respectively. The Operating Partnership pays distributions to ROIC directly as a holder of units of the Operating Partnership, and indirectly to ROIC through distributions to Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of ROIC. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of its net taxable income. ROIC intends to pay regular quarterly dividends to its stockholders in an amount not less than its net taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by its board of directors. If ROIC s cash available for distribution is less than its net taxable income, ROIC could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or ROIC may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 The Company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates related to its debt. There is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates. The extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the Company s future financing requirements. 
 
 As a corporation that has elected to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2010, ROIC s future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. The Company will be exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt used to acquire properties and make real estate-related debt investments. The Company s interest rate risk management objectives will be to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, the Company expects to borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and, in some cases, with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates. In addition, the Company may use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The Company will not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and will only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 335.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding. The Company has historically used fixed-rate debt and interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk. As discussed in Note 9 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company s two interest rate swaps matured effective August 31, 2024, and accordingly, the interest rate on a portion of the term loan was no longer effectively fixed and outstanding borrowings under the term loan became subject to a variable interest rate effective September 1, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the variable interest rates on the outstanding borrowings under the term loan and credit facility were 6.3 and 6.1 , respectively. 
 
 A 100 basis-point increase in short-term interest rates would have increased the Company s interest expense by approximately 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (after giving effect to the impact of the interest rate swaps which effectively fixed the interest rate on a portion of borrowings under the term loan at approximately 5.4 during the period from January 1, 2024 through August 31, 2024). 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Controls and Procedures (Retail Opportunity Investments Corp.) 
 
 ROIC s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based on their evaluation of ROIC s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15, have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, ROIC s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurances to the timely collection, evaluation and disclosure of information relating to ROIC that would potentially be subject to disclosure under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in ROIC s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, ROIC s internal control over financial reporting.
