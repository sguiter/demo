FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 This document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are based on management s beliefs and assumptions and can often be identified by terms and phrases that include anticipate, believe, intend, estimate, expect, continue, should, could, may, plan, project, predict, will, potential, forecast, target, guidance, outlook or other similar terminology. Various factors may cause actual results to be materially different than the suggested outcomes within forward-looking statements; accordingly, there is no assurance that such results will be realized. These factors include, but are not limited to: 
 The ability to implement our business strategy, including our carbon emission reduction goals; 
 State, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives, including costs of compliance with existing and future environmental requirements, including those related to climate change, as well as rulings that affect cost and investment recovery or have an impact on rate structures or market prices; 
 The extent and timing of costs and liabilities to comply with federal and state laws, regulations and legal requirements related to coal ash remediation, including amounts for required closure of certain ash impoundments, are uncertain and difficult to estimate; 
 The ability to timely recover eligible costs, including amounts associated with coal ash impoundment retirement obligations, asset retirement and construction costs related to carbon emissions reductions, and costs related to significant weather events, and to earn an adequate return on investment through rate case proceedings and the regulatory process; 
 The costs of decommissioning nuclear facilities could prove to be more extensive than amounts estimated and all costs may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process; 
 The impact of extraordinary external events, such as the pandemic health event resulting from COVID-19, and their collateral consequences, including the disruption of global supply chains or the economic activity in our service territories; 
 Costs and effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; 
 Industrial, commercial and residential growth or decline in service territories or customer bases resulting from sustained downturns of the economy, storm damage, reduced customer usage due to cost pressures from inflation or fuel costs, and the economic health of our service territories or variations in customer usage patterns, including energy efficiency efforts, natural gas building and appliance electrification, and use of alternative energy sources, such as self-generation and distributed generation technologies; 
 Federal and state regulations, laws and other efforts designed to promote and expand the use of energy efficiency measures, natural gas electrification, and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in Duke Energy service territories could result in a reduced number of customers, excess generation resources as well as stranded costs; 
 Advancements in technology; 
 Additional competition in electric and natural gas markets and continued industry consolidation; 
 The influence of weather and other natural phenomena on operations, financial position, and cash flows, including the economic, operational and other effects of severe storms, hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes and tornadoes, including extreme weather associated with climate change; 
 Changing investor, customer and other stakeholder expectations and demands including heightened emphasis on environmental, social and governance concerns and costs related thereto; 
 The ability to successfully operate electric generating facilities and deliver electricity to customers including direct or indirect effects to the Company resulting from an incident that affects the United States electric grid or generating resources; 
 Operational interruptions to our natural gas distribution and transmission activities; 
 The availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply; 
 The impact on facilities and business from a terrorist or other attack, war, vandalism, cybersecurity threats, data security breaches, operational events, information technology failures or other catastrophic events, such as severe storms, fires, explosions, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences; 
 The inherent risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities, including environmental, health, safety, regulatory and financial risks, including the financial stability of third-party service providers; 
 The timing and extent of changes in commodity prices and interest rates and the ability to recover such costs through the regulatory process, where appropriate, and their impact on liquidity positions and the value of underlying assets; 
 The results of financing efforts, including the ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, which can be affected by various factors, including credit ratings, interest rate fluctuations, compliance with debt covenants and conditions, an individual utility s generation mix, and general market and economic conditions; 
 Credit ratings of the Duke Energy Registrants may be different from what is expected; 
 Declines in the market prices of equity and fixed-income securities and resultant cash funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans, other post-retirement benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning trust funds; 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

 Construction and development risks associated with the completion of the Duke Energy Registrants capital investment projects, including risks related to financing, timing and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, obtaining and complying with terms of permits, meeting construction budgets and schedules and satisfying operating and environmental performance standards, as well as the ability to recover costs from customers in a timely manner, or at all; 
 Changes in rules for regional transmission organizations, including changes in rate designs and new and evolving capacity markets, and risks related to obligations created by the default of other participants; 
 The ability to control operation and maintenance costs; 
 The level of creditworthiness of counterparties to transactions; 
 The ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs and recover on claims made; 
 Employee workforce factors, including the potential inability to attract and retain key personnel; 
 The ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions to Duke Energy Corporation holding company (the Parent); 
 The performance of projects undertaken by our businesses and the success of efforts to invest in and develop new opportunities; 
 The effect of accounting and reporting pronouncements issued periodically by accounting standard-setting bodies and the SEC; 
 The impact of United States tax legislation to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and our credit ratings; 
 The impacts from potential impairments of goodwill or equity method investment carrying values; 
 Asset or business acquisitions and dispositions may not yield the anticipated benefits; and 
 The actions of activist shareholders could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to execute on our business strategy, or cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock. 
 Additional risks and uncertainties are identified and discussed in the Duke Energy Registrants' reports filed with the SEC and available at the SEC's website at sec.gov. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than described. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Duke Energy Registrants expressly disclaim an obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

 Duke Energy (Parent) and several Duke Energy renewables project companies, located in the ERCOT market, were named in several lawsuits arising out of Texas Storm Uri, which occurred in February 2021. The legal actions related to all but one of the project companies in this matter transferred to affiliates of Brookfield in conjunction with the transaction closing in October 2023. In May 2024, the remaining claim in the lawsuit was transferred to the buyer in connection with the sale of a portion of the remaining Commercial Renewables assets. See Note 5 for more information. 
 As part of the purchase and sale agreement for the distributed generation group, Duke Energy has agreed to retain certain guarantees, with expiration dates between 2029 through 2034, related to tax equity partners' assets and operations that will be disposed of via sale. Duke Energy has obtained certain guarantees from the buyers in regards to future performance obligations to assist in limiting Duke Energy's exposure under the retained guarantees.

 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress 
 Nuclear Statio n Subsequent License Renewal 
 On June 7, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a subsequent license renewal (SLR) application for the Oconee Nuclear Station (ONS) with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to renew ONS s operating license for an additional years. The SLR would extend operations of the facility from to years. The current licenses for units 1 and 2 expire in 2033 and the license for unit 3 expires in 2034. By a Federal Register Notice dated July 28, 2021, the NRC provided a -day comment period for persons whose interest may be affected by the issuance of a subsequent renewed license for ONS to file a request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. On September 27, 2021, Beyond Nuclear and Sierra Club (Petitioners) filed a Hearing Request and Petition to Intervene (Hearing Request) and a Petition for Waiver. The Hearing Request proposed contentions and claimed that Duke Energy Carolinas did not satisfy the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, or the NRC s NEPA-implementing regulations. Following Duke Energy Carolinas' answer and the Petitioners' reply, on February 11, 2022, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) issued its decision on the Hearing Request and found that the Petitioners failed to establish that the proposed contentions are litigable. The ASLB also denied the Petitioners' Petition for Waiver and terminated the Hearing Request proceeding. 
 On February 24, 2022, the NRC issued a decision in the SLR appeal related to Florida Power and Light's Turkey Point nuclear generating station in Florida. The NRC ruled that the NRC s license renewal Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) does not apply to SLR because the GEIS does not address SLR. The decision overturned a 2020 NRC decision that found the GEIS applies to SLR. Although Turkey Point is not owned or operated by a Duke Energy Registrant, the NRC s order applies to all SLR applicants, including ONS. The NRC order also indicated no subsequent renewed licenses will be issued until the NRC staff has completed an adequate NEPA review for each application. On April 5, 2022, the NRC approved a 24-month rulemaking plan that will enable the NRC staff to complete an adequate NEPA review. Although an SLR applicant may wait until the rulemaking is completed, the NRC also noted that an applicant may submit a supplement to its environmental report providing information on environmental impacts during the SLR period prior to the rulemaking being completed. On November 7, 2022, Duke Energy Carolinas submitted a supplement to its environmental report addressing environmental impacts during the SLR period. On March 6, 2024, the NRC staff submitted the rulemaking, which included the updated GEIS, to the NRC. The NRC approved the publicatio n of the final rule o n May 16, 2024. The updated GEIS was finalized and published on August 1, 2024, and the final rule was issued on August 6, 2024. 
 On December 19, 2022, the NRC published a notice in the Federal Register that the NRC will conduct a limited scoping process to gather additional information necessary to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental impacts at ONS during the SLR period. The NRC received comments from the EPA and the Petitioners and these comments identify 18 potential impacts that should be considered by the NRC in the EIS, which include, but are not limited to, climate change and flooding, environmental justice, severe accidents and external events. On February 8, 2024, the NRC issued the Oconee site-specific draft EIS. The NRC and EPA published the notice for the public to submit comments on the ONS site-specific draft EIS. On April 29, 2024, the Petitioners filed a Hearing Request. The request proposed three contentions and claimed that the ONS site-specific draft EIS is inadequate to satisfy the requirements of NEPA and the NRC s NEPA-implementing regulations. Duke Energy Carolinas provided responses to the proposed contentions by May 31, 2024, as ordered by the ASLB. On June 24, 2024, the ASLB convened a pre-hearing conference to obtain information and ask questions concerning the admissibility of the Petitioners' contentions. On August 29, 2024, the ASLB issued a protective order to protect Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI) that is identified as Critical Energy/Electrical Infrastructure Inform ation. On October 18, 2024, the ASLB indicated that it plans to issue a decision on contention admissibility by December 18, 2024. The NRC's issuance of the final EIS is pending the ASLB's decision.

 MYRP period. In addition to the MYRP, the PBR application included an Earnings Sharing Mechanism, Residential Decoupling Mechanism and Performance Incentive Mechanisms (PIMS) as required by HB 951. The application as originally filed requested an overall retail revenue increase of million in Year 1, million in Year 2 and million in Year 3, for a combined total of million, or , by early 2026. T he rate increase is driven primarily by transmission and distribution investments since the last rate case and projected in the MYRP, as well as investments in energy storage and solar assets included in the MYRP consistent with the Carolinas Carbon Plan (Carbon Plan). 
 On August 22, 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas filed with the NCUC a partial settlement with the Public Staff in connection with its PBR application. The partial settlement included, among other things, a greement on a substantial portion of the North Carolina retail rate base for the historic base case of approximately billion and all of the capital projects and related costs to be included in the MYRP, including billion (North Carolina retail allocation) projected to go in service over the MYRP period. Additionally, the partial settlement included agreement, with certain adjustments, on depreciation rates, the recovery of grid improvement plan costs and PIMs, Tracking Metrics and the Residential Decoupling Mechanism under t he PBR application. On August 28, 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas filed with the NCUC a second partial settlement with the Public Staff resolving additional issues, including the future treatment of nuclear production tax credits related to the Inflation Reduction Act, through a stand-alone rider that will provide the benefits to customers beginning January 1, 2025. As a result of the partial settlements, Duke Energy Carolinas recognized pretax charges of million within Impairment of assets and other charges, which primarily related to certain COVID-19 deferred costs, and million within Operations, maintenance and other, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 On December 1 5, 2023, the NCUC issued an order approving Duke Energy Carolinas' PBR application, as modified by the partial settlements and the order, including an overall retail revenue increase of million in Year 1, million in Year 2 and million in Year 3, for a combined total of million. T he order established an ROE of based upon an equity ratio of and approved, with certain adjustments, depreciation rates and the recovery of grid improvement plan costs and certain deferred COV ID-related costs. Additionally, the Residential Decoupling Mechanism and PIMs were approved as requested under the PBR application and revised by the partial settlements. Duke Energy Carolinas implemented interim rates, subject to refund, on September 1, 2023. New revised Year 1 rates and the residential decoupling were implemented on January 15, 2024. 
 On February 13, 2024, a number of parties filed Notices of Appeal of the December 15, 2023, NCUC order. Notices of Appeal were filed by the Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates (CIGFUR) III, a collection of various electric membership corporations (collectively, the EMCs), and the North Carolina Attorney General s Office (the AGO). CIGFUR III and the EMCs appealed the interclass subsidy reduction percentage and the Transmission Cost Allocation stipulation. In addition, CIGFUR III appealed the NCUC s elimination of the equal percentage fuel cost allocation methodology. The AGO appealed several issues including the authorized ROE and certain rate design and accounting matters . On March 1, 2024, Carolina Utility Customers Association, Inc. appealed several issues, including the authorized ROE and certain rate design and accounting matters. In July 2024, the Supreme Court of North Carolina consolidated the appeal with the parallel appeal of the NCUC's order regarding the Duke Energy Progress PBR application. The briefing is scheduled to be completed by December 31, 2024. Duke Energy Carolinas anticipates a decision to be issued by the third quarter of 2025. 
 2024 South Carolina Rate Case 
 On January 4, 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a rate case with the PSCSC to request an increase in base rate retail revenues. On May 17, 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas and the Office of Regulatory Staff, as well as other consumer, environmental, and industrial intervening parties, filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Settlement reso lving all issues in the base rate proceeding. The major components of the settlement include a million annual customer rate increase, prior to a reduction from the accelerated return to customers of federal unprotected Property, Plant and Equipment related EDIT of million annually over the first . The stipulation includes an ROE of with an equity ratio of and resolves recovery of the Company's continued investments in the grid, its new corporate headquarters and environmental compliance costs. The PSCSC held a hearing on May 20, 2024, to consider evidence supporting the stipulation. On July 3, 2024, the PSCSC issued its final order approving an increase in base rates and approving nearly all components of the Agreement and Stipulation of Settlement. The order revised recovery of certain environmental compliance costs, the only provision of the settlement agreement not fully approved by the PSCSC.

The ROE band can be increased by basis points if the average 30-year U.S. Treasury rate increases basis points or more over a six-month period in which case the midpoint ROE would rise from to . On July 25, 2022, this provision was triggered. Duke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on August 12, 2022, to increase the ROE effective August 2022 with a base rate increase effective January 1, 2023. The FPSC approved this request on October 4, 2022. The 2021 Settlement Agreement also provided that Duke Energy Florida will be able to retain million of the expected Department of Energy (DOE) award from its lawsuit to recover spent nuclear fuel to mitigate customer rates over the term of the 2021 Settlement. In return, Duke Energy Florida is permitted to recognize the million into earnings through the approved settlement period. Duke Energy Florida settled the DOE lawsuit and received payment of approximately million on June 15, 2022, of which the retail portion was approximately million. The 2021 Settlement authorizes Duke Energy Florida to collect the difference between million and the million retail portion of the amount received through the capacity cost recovery clause. As of September 30, 2024, Duke Energy Florida has recognized million (pretax) into earnings, including million and million recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and million and million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The remaining million is expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 The 2021 Settlement also contained a provision to recover or flow back the effects of tax law changes. As a result of the IRA enacted on August 16, 2022, Duke Energy Florida is eligible for PTCs associated with solar facilities placed in service beginning in January 2022. Duke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on October 17, 2022, to reduce base rates effective January 1, 2023, by million to flow back the expected 2023 PTCs and to flow back the expected 2022 PTCs via an adjustment to the capacity cost recovery clause. On December 14, 2022, the FPSC issued an order approving Duke Energy Florida's petition. 
 In addition to these terms, the 2021 Settlement contained provisions related to the accelerated depreciation of Crystal River Units 4-5, the approval of approximately billion in future investments in new cost-effective solar power, the implementation of a new Electric Vehicle Charging Station Program and the deferral and recovery of costs in connection with the implementation of Duke Energy Florida s Vision Florida program, which explores various emerging non-carbon emitting generation technology, distributed technologies and resiliency projects, among other things.

 The FPSC approved the 2021 Settlement on May 4, 2021, issuing an order on June 4, 2021. Revised customer rates became effective January 1, 2022, with subsequent base rate increases effective January 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024. 
 Clean Energy Connection 
 On July 1, 2020, Duke Energy Florida petitioned the FPSC for approval of a voluntary solar program consisting of new solar generating facilities with combined capacity of approximately MW. The program allows participants to support cost-effective solar development in Florida by paying a subscription fee based on per kilowatt subscriptions and receiving a credit on their bill based on the actual generation associated with their portion of the solar portfolio. The estimated cost of the new solar generation facilities is approximately billion and the projects are expected to be completed by the end of 2024. This investment is included in base rates offset by the revenue from the subscription fees and the credits will be included for recovery in the fuel cost recovery clause. The FPSC approved the program in January 2021. 
 On February 24, 2021, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) filed a notice of appeal of the FPSC s order approving the Clean Energy Connection to the Supreme Court of Florida. The Supreme Court of Florida heard oral arguments in the appeal on February 9, 2022. On May 27, 2022, the Supreme Court of Florida issued an order remanding the case back to the FPSC so that the FPSC can amend its order to better address some of the arguments raised by LULAC. On September 23, 2022, the FPSC issued a revised order and submitted it on September 26, 2022, to the Supreme Court of Florida. The Supreme Court of Florida requested that the parties file supplemental briefs regarding the revised order, which were filed February 6, 2023. LULAC has filed a request for Oral Argument on the issues discussed in the supplemental briefs, but the court has yet to rule on that request.

 D uke Energy 
 Texas Storm Uri Tort Litigation 
 Duke Energy (Parent), several Duke Energy renewables project companies , and others in the ERCOT market were named in multiple lawsuits arising out of Texas Storm Uri, which occurred in February 2021. These lawsuits seek recovery for property damage, personal injury and wrongful death allegedly caused by the power outages that plaintiffs claim were the collective failure of generators including Duke Energy entities, transmission and distribution operators (TDUs), retail energy providers, and all others, including ERCOT. The cases were consolidated into a Texas state court multidistrict litigation (MDL) proceeding for discovery and pre-trial motions. MDL cases were designated as lead cases in which motions to dismiss were filed and all other cases were stayed. 
 On January 28, 2023, the court denied certain motions including those by the generator defendants and TDUs and granted others. The generators and TDUs filed separate petitions for Writ of Mandamus to the Texas Court of Appeals seeking to overturn the denials. The TDUs' petition, filed first, was accepted and oral argument was held on October 23, 2023. In the cases against the generators, plaintiffs have dismissed the claims against Duke Energy (Parent). However, before Duke Energy (Parent) was dismissed from all cases, on December 14, 2023, without argument, the Court of Appeals accepted mandamus of the generator defendants ap peal, which includes all Duke Energy entities, and directed the MDL court to dismiss all claims. Plaintiffs filed their Petition for Reconsideration on January 29, 20 24, and the generator defendants responded on May 6, 2024. Regardless of the outcome of any motion for reconsideration or appeal, claims against Duke Energy (Parent) will remain dismissed. In October 2023, in conjunction with the closing of the sale of the utility-scale solar and wind group, all but one of the project company lawsuits transferred to Brookfield. In May 2024, the remaining claim in the lawsuit was transferred to the buyer in connection with the sale of a portion of the remaining Commercial Renewables assets. See Note 2 for more information related to the sale of the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups. 
 Duke Energy Carolinas 
 NTE Carolinas II, LLC Litigation 
 In November 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas entered into a standard FERC large generator interconnection agreement (LGIA) with NTE Carolinas II, LLC (NTE), a company that proposed to build a combined-cycle natural gas plant in Rockingham County, North Carolina. On September 6, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a lawsuit in Mecklenburg County Superior Court against NTE for breach of contract, alleging that NTE's failure to pay benchmark payments for Duke Energy Carolinas' transmission system upgrades required under the interconnection agreement constituted a termination of the interconnection agreement. Duke Energy Carolinas sought a monetary judgment against NTE because NTE failed to make multiple milestone payments. The lawsuit was moved to federal court in North Carolina. NTE filed a motion to dismiss Duke Energy Carolinas complaint and brought counterclaims alleging anti-competitive conduct and violations of state and federal statutes. Duke Energy Carolinas filed a motion to dismiss NTE's counterclaims. Both NTE's and Duke Energy Carolinas' motions to dismiss were subsequently denied by the court. 
 On May 21, 2020, in response to a NTE petition challenging Duke Energy Carolinas' termination of the LGIA, FERC issued a ruling that 1) it has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a transmission provider may terminate an LGIA; 2) FERC approval is required to terminate a conforming LGIA if objected to by the interconnection customer; and 3) Duke Energy may not announce the termination of a conforming LGIA unless FERC has approved the termination. FERC's Office of Enforcement also initiated an investigation of Duke Energy Carolinas into matters pertaining to the LGIA. On April 6, 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas received notice from the FERC Office of Enforcement that they have closed their non-public investigation with no further action recommended.

These reserves are classified in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities and Other within Current Liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These reserves are based on Duke Energy Carolinas' best estimate for current and future asbestos claims through 2044 and are recorded on an undiscounted basis. In light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer-term forecast, management does not believe they can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after 2044 related to such potential claims. It is possible Duke Energy Carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves. 
 Duke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. Receivables for insurance recoveries were million at September 30, 2024, a nd million at December 31, 2023. These amounts are classified in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets and Receivables within Current Assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by the third-party insurance carrier. Duke Energy Carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims. Duke Energy Carolinas believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating. 
 The reserve for credit losses for insurance receivables is million as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023, for both Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas.

 Receivables Financing DERF/DEPR/DEFR 
 DERF, DEPR and DEFR are bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiaries of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, respectively. DERF, DEPR and DEFR are wholly owned LLCs with separate legal existence from their parent companies, and their assets are not generally available to creditors of their parent companies. On a revolving basis, DERF, DEPR and DEFR buy certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity and related services from their parent companies. 
 DERF, DEPR and DEFR borrow amounts under credit facilities to buy these receivables. Borrowing availability from the credit facilities is limited to the amount of qualified receivables purchased, which generally exclude receivables past due more than a predetermined number of days and reserves for expected past-due balances. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligations is cash collections from the receivables. Amounts borrowed under the DERF, DEPR and DEFR credit facilities are reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as Current maturities of long-term debt. 
 The most significant activity that impacts the economic performance of DERF, DEPR and DEFR are the decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are considered the primary beneficiaries and consolidate DERF, DEPR and DEFR, respectively, as they make those decisions. 
 In April 2024, Duke Energy Florida repaid all outstanding DEFR borrowings totaling million and terminated the related DEFR credit facility. Additionally, Duke Energy Florida's related restricted receivables outstanding at DEFR at the time of termination totaled million and were transferred back to Duke Energy Florida to be collected and reported as Receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Receivables Financing CRC 
 CRC is a bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity indirectly owned by Duke Energy. On a revolving basis, CRC bought certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity, natural gas and related services from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. CRC then borrowed amounts under a credit facility to buy the receivables from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. Borrowing availability from the credit facility was limited to the amount of qualified receivables sold to CRC, which generally excluded receivables past due more than a predetermined number of days and reserved for expected past-due balances. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligation was cash collections from the receivables. 
 The proceeds Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana received from the sale of receivables to CRC were approximately cash and in the form of a subordinated note from CRC. The subordinated note was a retained interest in the receivables sold. Depending on collection experience, additional equity infusions to CRC would be required by Duke Energy to maintain a minimum equity balance of million.

 Nuclear Asset-Recovery Bonds 
 Duke Energy Florida Project Finance, LLC (DEFPF) is a bankruptcy remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of Duke Energy Florida. DEFPF was formed in 2016 for the sole purpose of issuing nuclear asset-recovery bonds to finance Duke Energy Florida's unrecovered regulatory asset related to Crystal River Unit 3. 
 In 2016, DEFPF issued senior secured bonds and used the proceeds to acquire nuclear asset-recovery property from Duke Energy Florida. The nuclear asset-recovery property acquired includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable nuclear asset-recovery charge from all Duke Energy Florida retail customers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The nuclear asset-recovery bonds are secured by the nuclear asset-recovery property and cash collections from the nuclear asset-recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders have no recourse to Duke Energy Florida. 
 DEFPF is considered a VIE primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. Duke Energy Florida has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE as described above and therefore Duke Energy Florida is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates DEFPF.

 Duke Energy has investments in various joint ventures including pipeline and renewable natural gas projects. These entities are considered VIEs due to having insufficient equity to finance their own activities without subordinated financial support. Duke Energy does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of these VIEs and therefore does not consolidate these entities. 
 CRC 
 Amounts included in Receivables from affiliated companies in the above table for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana reflect their retained interest in receivables sold to CRC as of December 31, 2023. The subordinated notes held by Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are stated at fair value as of December 31, 2023.

 Trade and other receivables are evaluated based on an estimate of the risk of loss over the life of the receivable and current and historical conditions using supportable assumptions. Management evaluates the risk of loss for trade and other receivables by comparing the historical write-off amounts to total revenue over a specified period. Historical loss rates are adjusted due to the impact of current conditions, as well as forecasted conditions over a reasonable time period. The calculated write-off rate can be applied to the receivable balance for which an established reserve does not already exist. Management reviews the assumptions and risk of loss periodically for trade and other receivables.

 2023 
 Duke Energy uses a December 31 measurement date for its qualified non-contributory defined benefit retirement plan assets and obligations. However, because Duke Energy believes it is probable in 2024 that total lump-sum benefit payments for one of its defined benefit retirement plans will exceed the settlement threshold, which is defined as the sum of the service cost and interest cost on projected benefit obligation components of net periodic pension costs, Duke Energy remeasured the plan's assets and plan's projected benefit obligation as of September 30, 2024. The discount rate used for the September 30, 2024 remeasurement was and the cash balance interest crediting rate was . The interest rate for lump sum and annuity conversions was updated to reflect current market conditions. All other assumptions used for the September 30, 2024, remeasurement were consistent with the measurement as of December 31, 2023. 
 As a result of the remeasurement, Duke Energy recognized a remeasurement loss of million, of which million was recorded in Regulatory Assets within Other Noncurrent Assets and million was recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. The remeasurement loss, which represents a decrease in funded status of the plan, reflects an increase of million in the fair value of the plan's assets and an increase of million in the plan's projected benefit obligation. 
 As the result of settlement accounting, Duke Energy recognized settlement charges of million, of which million was recorded to Regulatory Assets within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and million was recorded to Other Income and Expenses, net, within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as of September 30, 2024.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is separately filed by Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. However, none of the registrants make any representation as to information related solely to Duke Energy or the Subsidiary Registrants of Duke Energy other than itself. 
 
 DUKE ENERGY 
 Duke Energy is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and operates in the U.S. primarily through its subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. Duke Energy s consolidated financial information includes the results of the Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and with Duke Energy s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Executive Overview 
 Operational Excellence, Safety and Reliability . The reliable and safe operation of our power generating facilities, electric distribution system and natural gas infrastructure in our communities continues to be foundational to serving our customers, our financial results, and our credibility with stakeholders. In recent months, we have responded to several unprecedented and catastrophic weather events across our service territories. 
 In August 2024, Hurricane Debby made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 storm, impacting the Duke Energy Florida territory as well as the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress territories in North Carolina and South Carolina and causing approximately 700,000 customer outages. In late September 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 storm and subsequently impacted all of Duke Energy's service territories as the storm moved inland, with the most severe damage occurring in Florida and the Carolinas. Approximately 3.5 million customers were impacted by Hurricane Helene across Duke Energy's system, the largest number of companywide outages from a single event on our system ever reported. Then, in October 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida as a Category 3 storm, causing severe damage across our Florida service territory as a result of high winds, rain and flooding and resulting in more than 1 million customer outages. 
 In such extreme circumstances, our immediate priority is, and always will be, executing the extensive storm preparation and response work to ensure the safe, timely, and efficient restoration of service to impacted customers as quickly as possible. Round-the-clock power restoration efforts continued following the historic damage inflicted by these storms with lineworkers, tree trimmers and removal experts, state department of transportation workers and countless others, working to repair and, in certain areas, completely rebuild, the critical electricity infrastructure that powers and supports the communities we serve. We've also seen the benefits of ongoing grid hardening investments, leveraging self-healing technologies and remote restoration capabilities to automate the rerouting of power, more effectively deploy resources, and reduce the frequency or duration of outages for many of our customers during severe weather events. 
 We will continue the important work of rebuilding our communities in the weeks and months ahead, including power infrastructure in the hardest-hit areas of our service territories. We also plan to work with our state commissions to appropriately track and recover storm costs under approved regulatory frameworks on a timely basis. We will also remain focused on balancing the bill impacts on our customers from such catastrophic events, including seeking insurance recovery and exploring the potential securitization of related costs in certain jurisdictions, as appropriate. For more information, see "Matters Impacting Future Results," "Liquidity and Capital Resources," and Notes 4 and 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and "Debt and Credit Facilities." 
 Advancing Our Clean Energy Transition. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to execute on our clean energy transition, remaining focused on reliability and affordability while delivering increasingly clean energy and providing strong, sustainable value for shareholders, customers, communities and employees. 
 In May 2024, we entered into memorandums of understanding with several large customers, which propose exploring new and innovative approaches to support carbon-free energy generation and serve future energy needs of large businesses in North Carolina and South Carolina through the use of new tariff structures. The proposed Accelerating Clean Energy (ACE) tariff framework includes new, voluntary pricing structures for large commercial and industrial customers, which enable their direct support of carbon-free energy generation investments including facilitating beneficial customer on-site generation and load flexibility programs. The proposed ACE tariffs would be subject to regulatory approvals and include protections for non-participating customers. 
 In January 2024, we filed supplemental modeling and analysis with the NCUC and PSCSC related to our combined systemwide Carolinas Resource Plan filed in August 2023. These updates were necessary due to substantially increased load forecasts resulting from continued economic development successes in the Carolinas occurring since the systemwide integrated resource plan was prepared. In March 2024, we filed for: (i) CPCNs with the NCUC for new natural gas generation facilities at the sites of the current Marshall Steam Station and Roxboro Plant in the Carolinas; and (ii) a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Convenience and Necessity with the PSCSC for a new solar center and associated facilities in Chesterfield and Darlington counties, South Carolina. Our energy transition strategy continues to focus on delivering a path to cleaner energy in a manner that protects grid reliability and affordability, all while meeting the energy demands of the growing and economically vibrant communities that we serve. 
 As we continue to strengthen our grid and bring clean energy resources online, our customers are important partners in our clean energy future. In January 2024, we received approval for PowerPair SM , a new incentive-based pilot program for installing home solar generation with battery energy storage in our Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina service territories. Enrollment options for residential customers that participate in the pilot include a one-time incentive of up to 9,000 for the installation of a solar plus battery system. The program was launched in May 2024 and successfully enrolled more than 1,300 customers in its first three months, providing another impactful way for our customers to save energy and money, while exploring new solutions to help manage low carbon grids of the future.

 Regulatory Activity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to move our regulatory strategy forward. See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for additional information. 
 In January 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a South Carolina rate case, the first base rate case filed by Duke Energy Carolinas in the state since 2018 and reflecting the South Carolina retail allocation of significant investments, including approximately 1.5 billion of transmission and distribution assets. In May 2024, we reached a constructive comprehensive settlement with certain parties and in July 2024, the PSCSC issued an order approving the settlement and revising recovery of certain environmental compliance costs. New rates were effective August 1, 2024. 
 In April 2024, we filed formal requests for new base rates across several jurisdictions including Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. 
 Duke Energy Florida filed a three-year rate plan that will begin in January 2025, once its current base rate settlement agreement concludes at the end of 2024, and proposed approximately 4.9 billion in incremental investments to reduce outages, expand solar generation, and increase generation unit efficiency. In August 2024, the FPSC approved our constructive comprehensive settlement with certain parties, allowing us to continue making important investments to reduce outages, shorten response times, meet future energy demands, increase clean, solar generation and explore innovative technologies to generate cost savings for our customers. 
 Duke Energy Indiana filed a general rate case with the IURC requesting an overall increase in revenues of 492 million. This is the first base rate case filed by Duke Energy Indiana since 2019 and reflects strategic investments to improve grid reliability and security, serve a growing customer base, and meet environmental regulations. These investments, which include approximately 345 miles of new power lines expected to be constructed through 2025, will support the more than 60,000 new customers anticipated since our last base rate case. 
 Piedmont filed a general rate case with the NCU C, its first base rate case in North Carolina since 2021, reflecting significant investments to support ongoing service reliability, system growth, and compliance with federal pipeline safety regulations in addition to two energy reliability centers in eastern North Carolina. In September 2024, we reached a constructive comprehensive settlement with certain partie s. Revised interim rates were effective November 1, 2024, subject to refund and pending NCUC approval of the settlement and a final order. 
 Also, in April 2024, Duke Energy Progress issued 177 million of storm recovery bonds, our first issuance under South Carolina's 2022 securitization legislation, which provided the necessary framework for us to lower the bill impacts on our customers related to critical storm restoration activities. 
 
 Matters Impacting Future Results 
 The matters discussed herein could materially impact the future operating results, financial condition and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants and Business Segments. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 Coal Ash Costs 
 In April 2024, the EPA issued the 2024 CCR Rule under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule by establishing regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities and previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities. Duke Energy is participating in legal challenges to the 2024 CCR Rule. 
 Cost recovery for future expenditures is anticipated and will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy s regulated operations. The majority of spend is expected to occur over the next 10 years. For more information, see "Other Matters" and Notes 4 and 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and "Asset Retirement Obligations." 
 Fuel Cost Recovery 
 As a result of rapidly rising commodity costs during 2022, including natural gas, fuel and purchased power prices in excess of amounts included in fuel-related revenues led to an increase in the under collection of fuel costs from customers in jurisdictions including those served by Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida. These amounts have been deferred in regulatory assets and impacted the cash flows of the registrants, including increased borrowings to temporarily finance related expenditures until recovery. Regulatory filings have been made and approved for recovery of all remaining uncollected 2022 fuel costs. Across all jurisdictions, Duke Energy is currently on pace to recover approximately 1.8 billion of deferred fuel costs in 2024 and we anticipate being in line with our historical average balance of deferred fuel costs by the end of this year. 
 Storm Cost Recovery 
 Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, a series of major storm events occurred that resulted in significant damage to utility infrastructure within our service territories and primarily impacted Duke Energy Carolinas', Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Florida's electric utility operations. Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton caused widespread outages and included unprecedented damage to certain assets, including the hardest-hit areas on the western coast of Florida and certain regions in western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina. Appropriate storm cost recovery mechanisms are in place to track and recover incremental costs from such events. Funding restoration activities and, in some cases, the complete rebuild of critical infrastructure, for a series of sequential events of this magnitude has resulted in incremental financing needs until cost recovery occurs and may impact the near-term results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of the impacted registrants. For more information related to storm cost estimates, regulatory asset deferrals, and financing activities, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and Notes 4 and 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and "Debt and Credit Facilities." 
 94 

MD A MATTERS IMPACTING FUTURE RESULTS 

 EPA Regulations of GHG Emissions 
 In April 2024, the EPA issued a final rule under section 111 of the Clean Air Act (EPA Rule 111) regulating GHG emissions from existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants. Duke Energy is analyzing the potential impacts the rule could have on the Company, which could be material and may influence the timing, nature, and magnitude of future generation investments in our service territories. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy s regulated operations. Duke Energy is participating in legal challenges to the final rule. For more information, see "Other Matters." 
 Supply Chain 
 The Company continues to monitor the ongoing stability of markets for key materials and other developments, including public policy outcomes, that could disrupt or impact the Company's supply chain and, as a result, may impact Duke Energy's execution of its capital plan, future financial results or the achievement of its clean energy goals. 
 Goodwill 
 The Duke Energy Registrants performed their annual goodwill impairment tests as of August 31, 2024. As of this date, all of the Duke Energy Registrants' reporting units' estimated fair values materially exceeded the carrying values except for the GU I reporting unit of Duke Energy Ohio. While no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2024, the potential for deteriorating economic conditions impacting GU I's future cash flows or equity valuations of peer companies could impact the estimated fair value of GU I, and goodwill impairment charges could be recorded in the future. 
 Other 
 Duke Energy continues to monitor general market conditions, including the potential for interest rate pressures on the Company's cost of capital, which may impact Duke Energy's execution of its capital plan, future financial results, or the achievement of its clean energy goals. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP in the U.S., as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS, discussed below. Non-GAAP financial measures are numerical measures of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner. 
 Management evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS. Adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS represent income from continuing operations available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders in dollar and basic per share amounts, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items. As discussed below, special items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS are GAAP Reported Earnings (Loss) and GAAP Reported Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share, respectively. 
 Special items included in the periods presented below include the following, which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs: 
 Regulatory Matters primarily represents impairment charges related to Duke Energy Carolinas' South Carolina rate case order in 2024 and the Duke Energy North Carolina rate case settlement and Duke Energy Progress' North Carolina rate case order in 2023. 
 System Post-Implementation Costs represents the net impact of charges related to nonrecurring customer billing adjustments as a result of implementation of a new customer system. 
 Preferred Redemption Costs represents charges related to the redemption of Series B Preferred Stock. 
 Discontinued operations primarily represents the operating results and impairments recognized related to the sale of Duke Energy's Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023 
 GAAP reported EPS was 1.60 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.59 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . In addition to the drivers below, GAAP reported EPS increased primarily due to higher impairments on the sale of the Commercial Renewables business in the prior year. 
 As discussed above, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted EPS. Duke Energy s third quarter 2024 adjusted EPS was 1.62 compared to 1.94 for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in adjusted EPS was primaril y due to a higher effective tax rate, storm costs, interest expense, and depreciation expense on a growing asset base, partially offset by growth from rate increases and riders.

 GAAP Reported EPS was 4.17 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.27 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition to the drivers below, GAAP reported EPS increased primarily due to higher impairments on the sale of the Commercial Renewables business in the prior year. 
 As discussed above, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted EPS. Duke Energy s adjusted EPS was 4.24 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 4.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in adjusted EPS was primarily due to growth from rate increases and riders, higher sales volumes and favorable weather, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate, interest expense, and depreciation expense on a growing asset base. 
 The following table reconciles non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EPS, to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Duke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and capital requirements. Duke Energy s capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. Additionally, due to its existing tax attributes and projected tax credits to be generated relating to the IRA, Duke Energy does not expect to be a significant federal cash taxpayer until around 2030. Duke Energy s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, included a summary and detailed discussion of projected primary sources and uses of cash for 2024 to 2026. 
 In 2024, Duke Energy executed several equity forward sales agreements as part of the ATM program. Settlement of the forward sales agreements is expected to occur by December 31, 2024. See Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Stockholders Equity for further details. Also in 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress began recording nuclear PTC deferred tax assets related to the IRA and began monetizing the PTCs in the transferability markets established by the IRA beginning in October 2024. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress w ill work with the state utility commissions on the appropriate regulatory process to pass the net realizable value back to customers over time. See Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Income Taxes, for further information . 
 As of September 30, 2024, Duke Energy had 376 million of cash on hand and 5.4 billion a vailable under its 9 billion Master Cr edit Facility. Duke Energy expects to have sufficient liquidity in the form of cash on hand, cash from operations and available credit capacity to support its funding needs. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, Moody s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) maintained the credit ratings and affirmed the ratings outlook for all of the Duke Energy Registrant s, including Duke Energy Ohio. Operations in Kentucky are conducted through Duke Energy Ohio's wholly owned subsidiary, Duke Energy Kentucky. Moody's revised Duke Energy Kentucky's ratings outlook to stable, citing the expectation that a credit supportive outcome in the utility's most recent electric rate case will support credit metrics appropriate for its Baa1 rating.

MD A LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

 As discussed in Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Variable Interest Entities," Duke Energy terminated and repaid CRC in March 2024 and Duke Energy Florida terminated and repaid DEFR in April 2024. As a result of these repayments, CRC and DEFR have ceased operations and no longer acquire the receivables of Duke Energy s subsidiaries. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress continue to evaluate financing opportunities and anticipate termination and repayment of the borrowing facilities of DERF and DEPR prior to their scheduled termination dates in January 2025 and April 2025, respectively. 
 Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, a series of major storm events occurred that resulted in significant damage to utility infrastructure within our service territories and primarily impacted Duke Energy Carolinas', Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Florida's electric utility operations. As discussed in Note 4, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton caused widespread outages and included unprecedented damage to certain assets, including the hardest-hit areas on the western coast of Florida and certain regions in western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina. Funding restoration activities and, in some cases, the complete rebuild of critical infrastructure, for a series of sequential events of this magnitude has resulted in incremental financing needs until cost recovery occurs. See "Matters Impacting Future Results" for further details and Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Debt and Credit Facilities," for information regarding Duke Energy's debt issuances and maturities, available credit facilities including the Master Credit Facility, and term loans executed in response to these major storm events. 
 See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Dispositions," for the timing and use of proceeds from the sale of certain Commercial Renewables assets to affiliates of Brookfield.

 OTHER MATTERS 
 Environmental Regulations 
 The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants. Refer to Note 4, "Regulatory Matters," in Duke Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for more information regarding potential plant retirements and Note 4, "Regulatory Matters," to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for further information regarding regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants. 
 In April 2024, the EPA issued the 2024 CCR Rule under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule by establishing regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities (Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments). The final rule also imposes a subset of the 2015 CCR Rule s requirements, including groundwater monitoring, corrective action (where necessary), and in certain cases, closure, and post-closure care requirements, on previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities (CCR Management Units). CCR Management Units may include surface impoundments and landfills that closed prior to the effectiv e date of the 2015 CCR Rule, inactive CCR landfills, and other areas where CCR is managed directly on the land at Duke Energy facilitie s. Duke Energy, as part of a group of similarly affected electric utilities, filed a petition to challenge the 2024 CCR Rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on August 6, 2024. For mo re information, see Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations."

MD A OTHER MATTERS 

 In April 2024, the EPA issued a final rule under section 111 of the Clean Air Act (EPA Rule 111) regulating GHG emissions from existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants, referred to as electric generating units (EGUs). EPA Rule 111 requires existing coal-fired power plants expected to operate in 2039 and beyond to reduce GHG emissions by 90 through the use of carbon capture and sequestration starting in 2032, subject to certain modifications for coal plants that retire sooner and co-fire natural gas. EPA Rule 111 also establishes GHG emissions reduction standards for new natural gas-fired EGUs, subject to carve-outs for smaller peaking units that fill gaps that cannot be met with renewables or storage. The EPA did not finalize emission guidelines for GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired stationary combustion turbines and intends to address these in a future rulemaking. Duke Energy is analyzing the potential impacts the rule could have on the Company, which could be material and may influence the timing, nature, and magnitude of future generation investments in our service territories. Duke Energy is participating in legal challenges to EPA Rule 111 as a member of Electric Generators for a Sensible Transition, a coalition of similarly affected utilities, and as a member of a utility trade group. The litigation is currently pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. 
 Cost recovery for future expenditures is anticipated and will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy s regulated operations. 
 Generation Mix Planning Process 
 In August 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed their 2023 systemwide Carolinas Resource Plan (the Plan) with the NCUC and PSCS C. T he Plan provided a range of generation options, including three core portfolios, reflecting an all of the above approach to powering the energy needs of our growing region. In the Plan, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recommended Portfolio 3 as the most prudent path forward to comply with applicable state laws, providing a reliable and orderly energy transition that was proposed as the most reasonable, executable, and lowest-cost plan for the Carolinas. Portfolio 3 proposes a diverse and reliable set of generation and energy storage solutions and shrinks the challenges of growth and the transition from coal by expanding industry-leading energy efficiency and demand response options, laying out a path to reliably exit coal by 2035. Portfolio 3 also makes the most of existing system resources by extending the lives of Duke Energy s nuclear plants and extending the license and doubling the peak hourly capacity of the Bad Creek pumped-hydro storage facility. Near-term actions consistent with Portfolio 3 were also proposed that will be executed between now and the end of 2026 to advance the orderly energy transition. 
 In November 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress provided notice to the NCUC and PSCSC of a substantially increased load forecast resulting from increased economic development in the Carolinas occurring since the systemwide Plan was prepared. The companies filed supplemental modeling and analysis with the NCUC and PSCSC in January 2024, demonstrating the need for additional resources beyond the set of resources identified by the companies in their initial plan. 
 In July 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress reached a broad settlement with the Public Staff of the NCUC, Walmart, and the Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association on the Plan, agreeing it is reasonable to use Portfolio 3 as the reference portfolio for planning purposes. Among other things, the settlement confirms a set of near-term activities, including development and procurement activities for solar, battery storage, onshore wind, and certain natural gas generation assets, as well as certain limited actions exploring initial development activities related to advanced nuclear, offshore wind, and to advance the potential for 1,834 MW of pumped storage hydro at the Bad Creek II facility by 2034. The NCUC conducted evidentiary hearings in July and August 2024 and issued an order accepting the settlement and providing further direction in November 2024. The order continues to emphasize the critical importance of reliability and maintaining affordability, while taking balanced actions to meet forecasted load growth. 
 The PSCSC held its hearings in September 2024 and in November 2024 voted to approve the Plan and directed Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to work with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff to provide alternative modeling around EPA Rule 111 compliance in a subsequent Carolinas Resource Plan filing.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, careful consideration should be given to the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in Duke Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect the Duke Energy Registrants financial condition or future results. The information presented below updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in Duke Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 BUSINESS STRATEGY RISKS 
 Duke Energy s future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its business strategy including achieving its carbon emissions reduction goals. 
 Duke Energy s results of operations depend, in significant part, on the extent to which it can implement its business strategy successfully. Duke Energy's clean energy transition, which includes achieving net-zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050, modernizing the regulatory construct, transforming the customer experience, and digital transformation, is subject to business, policy, regulatory, technology, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond its control and may make those goals difficult to achieve. 
 Federal or state policies could be enacted that restrict the availability of, and increase the costs associated with the use of, fuels or generation technologies, such as natural gas or nuclear power, that enable Duke Energy to reduce its carbon emissions. For example, new EPA rules issued in April 2024 impose stringent GHG emission reduction standards, revised air toxic limits, and wastewater discharge limitations that may impact our carbon-reduction targets, and operational timeline and costs associated with certain new and existing generation. Supportive policies may be needed to facilitate the siting and cost recovery of transmission and distribution upgrades needed to accommodate the build out of large volumes of renewables and energy storage. Further, the approval of our state regulators will be necessary for the Company to continue to retire existing carbon emitting assets or make investments in new generating capacity. The Company may be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on time. In addition, new technologies that are not yet commercially available or are unproven at utility-scale will likely be needed, including carbon capture and sequestration and supporting infrastructure as well as new resources capable of following electric load over long durations such as advanced nuclear, hydrogen and long-duration storage. If these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if we invest in early stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, Duke Energy s ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk. 
 Achieving our carbon reduction goals will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies including nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables without cost-effective storage, may challenge our ability to meet customer expectations of reliability and affordability in a carbon constrained environment, particularly as demand increases. Our nuclear fleet is central to our ability to meet these objectives and customer expectations. We are continuing to seek to renew the operating licenses of the 11 reactors we operate at six nuclear stations for an additional 20 years, extending their operating lives to and beyond midcentury. Failure to receive approval from the NRC for the relicensing of any of these reactors could affect our ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050. 
 As a consequence, Duke Energy may not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated results of its energy transition strategy, which may have an adverse effect on its financial condition.

OTHER INFORMATION 

 REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL RISKS 
 The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations requiring significant capital expenditures that can increase the cost of operations, and which may impact or limit business plans, or cause exposure to environmental liabilities. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations, including CCRs, air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. For example, the new EPA rules issued in April 2024, among other things, impose stringent GHG emissions limitations on existing coal plants and new natural gas plants and more stringent air toxic limits on existing coal plants, increase limitations on wastewater discharge, and impose groundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements on previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities (CCR Management Units) and inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities (Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments). Potential legal challenges to such rules may not be successful, and adherence to these rules may increase the cost of compliance, impact generation resource mix and carbon-reduction targets, and negatively impact customer reliability and affordability due to such rules' imposition of stringent GHG emissions limitations and reliance on carbon capture technologies that are not yet adequately demonstrated at utility-scale. These and other environmental laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. These laws and regulations generally require the Duke Energy Registrants to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties. Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets, as well as reputational damage. The steps the Duke Energy Registrants could be required to take to ensure their facilities are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive. As a result, the Duke Energy Registrants may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facilities, which may cause the Duke Energy Registrants to incur losses. Further, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be successful in recovering capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and their contracts with customers. Also, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for their operating assets or development projects. Delays in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, failure to obtain and comply with them or changes in environmental laws or regulations to more stringent compliance levels could, and are likely to, result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or development of new facilities being prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. The costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have a material effect on the Duke Energy Registrants results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
 The EPA has issued or proposed federal regulations, including the new rules issued in April 2024, governing the management of cooling water intake structures, wastewater, CCR management units, air toxics emissions, and CO 2 emissions. New state legislation in response to such regulations could impose carbon reduction goals that are more aggressive than the Company's plans. These regulations may require the Duke Energy Registrants to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance costs. 
 OPERATIONAL RISKS 
 The reputation and financial condition of the Duke Energy Registrants could be negatively impacted due to their obligations to comply with federal and state regulations, laws, and other legal requirements that govern the operations, assessments, storage, closure, remediation, disposal and monitoring relating to CCR, the high costs and new rate impacts associated with implementing these new CCR-related requirements and the strategies and methods necessary to implement these requirements in compliance with these legal obligations. 
 As a result of electricity produced for decades at coal-fired power plants, the Duke Energy Registrants manage large amounts of CCR that are primarily stored in dry storage within landfills or combined with water in surface impoundments, all in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. A CCR-related operational incident could have a material adverse impact on the reputation and results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. 
 During 2015, EPA regulations were enacted related to the management of CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the RCRA and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and, new and existing surface impoundments, and establish requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, as well as additional legal requirements that may be imposed in the future, such as the settlement reached with the NCDEQ to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina, and partially excavate the remaining two, and the EPA's January 11, 2022, issuance of a letter interpreting the CCR Rule, including its applicability and closure provisions. Most recently, in April 2024, the EPA issued its final Legacy Surface Impoundment Rule, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule to apply to legacy CCR surface impoundments (inactive impoundments at retired facilities) and CCR management units (previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities). These federal and state laws, regulations and other legal requirements may require or result in additional expenditures, including increased operating and maintenance costs, which could affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The Duke Energy Registrants will continue to seek full cost recovery for expenditures through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commissions, who permit recovery in rates of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with the Duke Energy Registrants regulated operations, and through other wholesale contracts with terms that contemplate recovery of such costs, although there is no guarantee of full cost recovery. In addition, the timing for and amount of recovery of such costs could have a material adverse impact on Duke Energy's cash flows. 
 The Duke Energy Registrants have recognized significant AROs related to these CCR-related requirements. Closure activities began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of CCR materials to off-site locations for use as structural fill, to appropriately engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or conversion of the ash for beneficial use. Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at the four high-priority North Carolina sites. At other sites, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced. As the closure and CCR management work progresses and final closure plans and corrective action measures are developed and approved at each site, the scope and complexity of work and the amount of CCR material could be greater than estimates and could, therefore, materially increase compliance expenditures and rate impacts.
