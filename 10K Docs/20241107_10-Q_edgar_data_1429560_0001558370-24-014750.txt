 TREVENA, INC. Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2024 segment and has its principal office in Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania. Since commencing operations in 2007, the Company has devoted substantially all of its financial resources and efforts to commercialization and research and development, including nonclinical studies and clinical trials. The Company has never been profitable. In late 2017, the Company submitted a new drug application, or NDA, for OLINVYK (OLINVYK) injection, or OLINVYK, to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. In August 2020, the FDA approved the NDA for OLINVYK and the Company initiated commercial launch of OLINVYK in the first quarter of 2021. While OLINVYK remains available for purchase by customers, we have substantially eliminated commercial support for the product to preserve capital as we explore strategic alternatives. Since its inception, the Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. The Company s net loss was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. The Company follows the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, or ASC 205-40, which requires management to assess the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The Company expects that its existing balance of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 is not sufficient to fund operations for one year after the date of this filing and therefore management has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans to mitigate this risk include raising additional capital through equity or debt financings, or through strategic transactions, including collaborations. Management s plans may also include the deferral of certain operating expenses unless and until additional capital is received. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital or that such capital, if available, will be on terms that are acceptable to the Company, or that the Company will be successful in deferring certain operating expenses. As a result, management concluded that such plans do not alleviate the substantial doubt. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional capital, consummate a strategic transaction or defer sufficient operating expenses, the Company may be compelled to reduce the scope of its operations and planned capital expenditures, or to wind down operations. per share for such fractional interests. All of the share and per share amounts discussed in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the effect of this reverse split.

Subsequent disposals of product nearing product expiration and shipments of OLINVYK to customers result in a reduction to finished goods and a corresponding reduction to the inventory reserve. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company disposed of million of inventory nearing product expiration. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were of shipments to customers. million in term loan borrowings (the Royalty Financing ). Term loan borrowings under the Royalty Financing were to be advanced in tranches. The first tranche of million was advanced in April 2022. The second tranche of million was to become available upon achievement of either a commercial or financing milestone as set forth in the Loan Agreement. The third tranche of million became available upon the first commercial sale of OLINVYK in China which occurred in August 2023, and the Company elected to receive such proceeds.

 Unamortized debt discount ) Carrying Value Current portion of loans payable, net ) Loans payable, net The term loans mature on the earlier of (i) the fifteen (15) year anniversary of the closing date in March 2022 and (ii) the date on which the license agreement with Nhwa expires. Repayment of any borrowings and related interest will be made quarterly beginning June 30, 2022. Repayment will be in the form of (i) a royalty payment on the Company s net sales of OLINVYK in the United States and (ii) proceeds from royalties from the Company s license agreement with Nhwa. As a result of Nhwa obtaining Chinese approval of OLINVYK in May 2023, royalties from net sales of OLINVYK in the United States are capped at million in accordance with the Loan Agreement. Upon a change in control or in the event the Company elects to repay any outstanding borrowings prior to their contractual maturity, SPV2 is required to pay a control premium equal to the greater of (i) principal and interest and (ii) million or million depending on the timing in which the triggering event occurs as further provided in the Loan Agreement. In April 2022, the Company placed million into an interest reserve account in connection with the Loan Agreement. Payments of interest under the Loan Agreement are made quarterly from the royalty on the Company s net sales of OLINVYK in the United States and proceeds from royalties from the Company s license agreement with Nhwa. On each interest payment date, if the royalty payments received do not equal the total interest due for the respective quarter, the interest payment due will be paid from the interest reserve account. The interest reserve account was classified as restricted cash on the Company s balance sheet at December 31, 2022. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company agreed to transfer the remaining funds, approximately million, to R-Bridge to prepay future interest payments. As of December 31, 2023, the prepaid interest had been reduced to through interest expense incurred under the Loan Agreement. Repayments of all borrowings, interest and other related payments, under the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets associated with the license agreement with Nhwa, the Chinese intellectual property related to OLINVYK, and deposit accounts established to hold amounts received on account for repayment of the borrowings and related interest under the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and contains customary defined events of default, upon which any outstanding principal and unpaid interest shall be due on demand. At September 30, 2024, there were no events of default pursuant to the Loan Agreement and the Company was in compliance with all covenants. Interest expense is imputed based on the estimated loan repayment period, which takes into consideration estimated future revenue in the United States and China. Changes in estimates are recognized prospectively and may have a material impact on liability balance. In connection with the first tranche borrowings in April 2022, the Company issued a warrant to R-Bridge to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at an initial exercise price of per share and will be exercisable for a period of from the date of issuance. In July 2024, these warrants were amended to reduce the exercise price to and extend the exercise period to from the date of the Amendment (as defined below). The Company concluded the warrants were a freestanding equity-classified instrument to which the proceeds from the first tranche was allocated across the debt and warrant on a relative fair value basis. In addition, the Company incurred lender fees and third-party costs of million each and were netted against the proceeds allocated to the debt and warrant. Fees netted against debt proceeds represent a debt discount and are amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method. In July 2024, the Company amended the Loan Agreement (the Amendment with respect to the second tranche for million. In connection with the Amendment, the Company received a million payment from R-Bridge and is eligible to receive an additional million based upon achievement of certain US partnering and US commercial milestones for OLINVYK. In connection with the Amendment, (i) the ownership of certain OLINVYK Chinese IP that had been previously pledged to R-Bridge under the Royalty Financing was transferred to R-Bridge, (ii) 

 11 

Table of Contents 
 from the date of the Amendment, (iii) the existing cap on US royalty payable to R-Bridge was increased from million to million (with minimum or fixed payments), and (iv) R-Bridge agreed to forgive million that was outstanding to them prior to the Amendment. This million forgiveness was determined to be a troubled debt restructuring and therefore no gain will be recognized by the Company for accounting purposes. The Company does not expect its existing balance of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 to be sufficient to fund operations for one year after the date of this filing, and management has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In consideration of the foregoing, the Amendment was determined to be a troubled debt restructuring. In connection with this analysis, R-Bridge was deemed to have granted a concession as the calculated effective borrowing rate after the Amendment was lower than immediately prior to the Amendment. As a result, no gain was recognized for the concession since the Amendment is being accounted for on a prospective basis. Additionally, the estimated payments from future royalties are less than the carrying value of the Royalty Financing. Therefore, no interest expense will be recognized prospectively until such time as the estimated royalty payments are greater than the carrying value of the Royalty Financing. Third-party costs related to the Amendment of million were expensed as incurred. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized interest expense of million. The accounting for the Loan Agreement requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions, particularly about future royalties under the license agreement with Nhwa and sales of OLINVYK in the United States and China. Such estimates and assumptions are utilized in determining the expected repayment term, amortization period of the debt discount, accretion of interest expense and classification between current and long-term portions of amounts outstanding. The Company amortizes the debt discount into interest expense over the expected term of the arrangement using the interest method based on projected cash flows. Similarly, the Company classifies as current debt for the Loan Agreement, amounts that are expected to be repaid during the succeeding twelve months after the reporting period end. However, the repayment of amounts due under the Loan Agreement is variable because the cash flows to be utilized for periodic payments is a function of amounts received by the Company with respect to the royalties and net product sales. Accordingly, the estimates of the magnitude and timing of amounts to be available for debt service are subject to significant variability and thus, subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, these estimates and assumptions are likely to change, which may result in future adjustments to the portion of the debt that is classified as a current liability, the amortization of debt discount and the accretion of interest expense. Other amounts that may become due and payable under the Loan Agreement, including amounts shared between the parties with respect to cash flows received in excess of pre-defined thresholds, are recognized as additional interest expense when they become probable and estimable. The amount of principal to be repaid in each of the five succeeding years is not fixed and determinable. shares of common stock as of September 30, 2024. The Company also was authorized to issue up to shares of preferred stock as of September 30, 2024. The Company is required, at all times, to reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock sufficient shares to effect the conversion of the shares of the preferred stock and all outstanding stock options and warrants. December 2023 Equity Offering and Warrant Issuance On December 28, 2023, the Company and a single investor entered into a securities purchase agreement whereby the Company issued pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded Warrants with an initial exercise price of per share for per Pre-Funded Warrant, which are exercisable immediately and do not expire. In addition, the investor received common stock warrants with an initial exercise price of per share, which were exercisable through April 19, 2029. As of September 30, 2024, all Pre-Funded Warrants have been exercised in full.

The weighted average exercise price of the Existing Warrants was per share and was reduced to per share in exchange for the investor agreeing to immediately exercise the Existing Warrants. Of the Existing Warrants exercised, were held in abeyance for the benefit of the holder due to certain beneficial ownership limitations and these shares were subsequently issued to the investor on June 26, 2024. In addition to reducing the exercise price, the Company issued common stock warrants (the Inducement Warrants to the investor with an initial exercise price of per share, which are exercisable through April 19, 2029. The fair value of the Inducement Warrants and the change in fair value of the Existing Warrants resulting from the reduction in the exercise price totaling million was accounted for as equity issuance costs in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company received million in total, after deducting underwriter fees and other third-party costs, as a result of the sale of pre-funded warrants and exercise of the warrants as part of the inducement. The warrants issued did not meet the requirements to be indexed to equity and equity classified and, as such, are classified as liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recorded within other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

The Black Scholes model requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions, including estimating the fair value of the Company s common stock, assumptions related to the expected price volatility of the Company s common stock, the period during which the options will be outstanding, the rate of return on risk free investments and the expected dividend yield for the Company s stock.

As part of the agreement, the Company also granted Pharmbio an option to manufacture OLINVYK, on a non-exclusive basis, for the development and commercialization of the product in South Korea, subject to a separate arrangement to be entered into if Pharmbio exercises the option. The license agreement is terminable by Pharmbio for any reason upon written notice. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, Pharmbio is solely responsible for all development and regulatory activities in South Korea. The parties have formed a Joint Development Committee with equal representation from the Company and Pharmbio to provide overall coordination and oversight of the development of OLINVYK in South Korea. The parties also agreed to form a Joint Manufacturing and Commercialization Committee at least prior to the anticipated date of regulatory approval of OLINVYK in South Korea to provide overall coordination and oversight of the manufacture and commercialization of OLINVYK in South Korea. License Agreement with Jiangsu Nhwa Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. In April 2018, the Company also entered into an exclusive license agreement with Jiangsu Nhwa Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., or Nhwa, for the development and commercialization of OLINVYK for the management of moderate to severe acute pain in China. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company received an upfront, non-refundable cash payment of million (less applicable withholding taxes of million) in July 2018. In August 2020, the Company received a milestone payment of million (less applicable withholding taxes of million), that became payable by Nhwa upon FDA approval of OLINVYK. In May 2023, the Company received a milestone payment of million (less applicable withholding taxes million), that became payable by Nhwa upon regulatory approval of OLINVYK in China. The Company is eligible to receive up to an additional million of commercialization milestone payments based on product sales levels in China, and a percent royalty on all net product sales in China, less applicable withholding taxes. In the third quarter of 2023, Nhwa launched OLINVYK, recognized net product sales in China and reported royalties on those sales to the Company. This royalty is required to be used by the Company to repay its obligations under the Loan Agreement. Royalty payments received from Nhwa are reported as restricted cash within current assets until remitted to R-Bridge. As part of the license agreement with Nhwa, the Company also granted Nhwa an option to manufacture OLINVYK, on an exclusive basis in China, for the development and commercialization of the product in China. In the second quarter of 2018, Nhwa elected to exercise this manufacturing option. The license agreement is terminable by Nhwa for any reason upon written notice. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, Nhwa is solely responsible for all development and regulatory activities in China. The parties have formed a Joint Development Committee with equal representation from the Company and Nhwa to provide overall coordination and oversight of the development of OLINVYK in China. The parties also formed a Joint Manufacturing and Commercialization Committee to provide overall coordination and oversight of the manufacture and commercialization of OLINVYK in China.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on April 1, 2024 . Unless the context otherwise requires, we use the terms Trevena, Company, we, us and our to refer to Trevena, Inc. Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel medicines for patients affected by central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. Our only commercialized product, OLINVYK (oliceridine) injection, or OLINVYK, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ), in August 2020. In October 2020, we announced that OLINVYK had received scheduling from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the DEA ), and was classified as a Schedule II controlled substance. We initiated commercial launch of OLINVYK in the first quarter of 2021. While OLINVYK remains available for purchase by customers, we have substantially eliminated commercial support for the product to preserve capital as we explore strategic alternatives. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated include, but are not limited to, a sale, license, divestiture or discontinuation of U.S. commercial sales of OLINVYK; or a sale, merger or wind down of the Company. There can be no assurance regarding the schedule for completion of the strategic review process, that this strategic review process will result in the Company pursuing any transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed. OLINVYK is an opioid agonist for use in adults for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an intravenous opioid analgesic and for whom alternative treatments are inadequate. We are also developing a pipeline of product candidates based on our proprietary product platform, including TRV045 for diabetic neuropathic pain, epilepsy, and seizure disorders; and TRV734 for moderate-to-severe acute and chronic pain and opioid use disorders. We are also developing TRV045, our novel sphingosine-1-phosphate, or S1P, receptor modulator that may offer a new, non-opioid approach to managing chronic pain, as well as for treating epilepsy and seizure disorders. TRV045 targets the S1P subtype 1 receptor and data suggests that TRV045 may effectively reverse neuropathic pain and reduce seizure risk without the immune-suppressing activity, or lymphopenia, observed with currently approved therapeutics targeting S1P receptors. In September 2023 we announced positive data from two clinical proof-of-concept studies. TRV045 demonstrated statistically significant analgesic effect in a capsaicin-induced model of neuropathic pain. TRV045 also demonstrated a statistically significant evidence of CNS activity as measured by resting state EEG power spectral analysis in a transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, study. Subjects in both studies were enrolled outside of the United States, and the studies were not conducted under the Investigational New Drug Application for TRV045. Since our incorporation in late 2007, our operations have included organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, discovering and developing our product candidates, and establishing our intellectual property portfolio. We have financed our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of our equity securities and debt borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 605.6 million. Our net loss was 17.5 million and 23.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue or sales. We do not expect to generate significant revenue or sales unless and until we or a collaborator successfully commercialize OLINVYK or obtain marketing approval for and successfully commercialize TRV045 or TRV734. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future even as we eliminate commercial support for OLINVYK. We will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. We will seek to fund our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other sources,

 including potential strategic transactions, including collaborations. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue our operations, development programs, and/or any future commercialization efforts. Recent Developments Reverse Stock Split Effective as of 12:01 am ET on August 13, 2024 (the Effective Time ), the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a 1-for-25 reverse stock of the Company s common stock (the Reverse Stock Split ). The Company s common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opened on August 13, 2024. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each 25 shares of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock immediately prior to the Effective Time were combined into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock. In addition, proportional adjustments were made to all outstanding securities or other rights convertible or exercisable into shares of the Company s common stock, including all options and warrants. The Reverse Stock Split did not have any effect on the stated par value of the Company s common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share received a proportional cash payment. All of the shares and per share amounts discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split. Nasdaq Delisting On October 4, 2024, the Company received notice that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel had determined to delist the Company s common stock from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq due to the Company s failure to comply with the minimum stockholder s equity requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Equity Standard Rule ). As previously disclosed, the Panel had provided the Company until October 2, 2024, to regain compliance with the Equity Standard Rule. Trading in the Company s common stock was suspended on Nasdaq effective with the open of business on October 8, 2024 (the Delisting ). Subsequent to the Delisting, the Company s common stock began trading on the Pink Open Market operated by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. (commonly referred to as the pink sheets on October 8, 2024 under the trading symbol TRVN. Transition of Executive Officers On October 5, 2024, in connection with certain cost-cutting measures, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the termination of employment, without cause, of Carrie L. Bourdow, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer; Barry Shin, the Company s Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Mark A. Demitrack, MD, the Company s Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer. The terminations did not involve any disagreement concerning the Company s operations, policies or practices. Also, on October 5, 2024, the Company entered into consulting agreements with Mr. Shin and Dr. Demitrack pursuant to which Mr. Shin and Dr. Demitrack will provide assistance, advice and expertise on corporate strategy, commercial and pipeline assets and other business topics as directed by the Company.

Upon the effectiveness of the resignations, the Board decreased the size of the Board to three members, with Carrie Bourdow continuing to serve as Chairman of the Board, and Scott Braunstein, M.D. and Barbara Yanni continuing to serve as directors of the Company. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we believe that the following accounting policies are important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and we have accordingly included them in this discussion. Product Revenue We account for product revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). We perform the following five steps to recognize revenue under ASC 606: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only recognize revenue when we believe that it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. We sell OLINVYK to wholesalers in the US (collectively, customers ). These customers subsequently resell our products generally to hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers and other purchasers of OLINVYK. We recognize revenue from OLINVYK sales at the point customers obtain control of the product, which generally occurs upon delivery. The transaction price that is recognized as revenue for products includes an estimate of variable consideration which is more fully described below. Variable Consideration We include an estimate of variable consideration in our transaction price at the time of sale when control of the product transfers to the customer. Variable consideration includes distributor chargebacks, prompt payment (cash) discounts, distribution service fees and product returns. We assess whether or not an estimate of our variable consideration is constrained based on the probability that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue may occur in the future when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may vary from 

 22 

Table of Contents 
 our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect product sales and earnings in the period such variances become known. Distributor Chargebacks When a product is sold to a third party that is subject to a contractual price agreement, the difference between the price paid to us by the wholesaler and the price under the specific contract is charged back to us by the wholesaler. Utilizing this information, we estimate a chargeback percentage for each product and record an allowance for chargebacks as a reduction to revenue when we record our sale of the products. We reduce the chargeback allowance when a chargeback request from a wholesaler is processed. Reserves for chargebacks are included in accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheet. Product Returns Generally, our customers have the right to return any unopened product during the eighteen (18) month period beginning six (6) months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending twelve (12) months after the labeled expiration date. We do not currently rely on industry data in our analysis of returns reserve. As we sold OLINVYK and established historical sales over a longer period of time (i.e., two to three years), we placed more reliance on historical purchasing, demand from hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers, return patterns of our customers and the amount of OLINVYK held by wholesalers, when evaluating our reserves for product returns. OLINVYK has a forty-eight (48) month shelf life. We recognize the amount of expected returns as a refund liability, representing the obligation to return the customer s consideration. Since the returns primarily consist of expired and short dated products that will not be resold, we do not record a return asset for the right to recover the goods returned by the customer at the time of the initial sale (when recognition of revenue is deferred due to the anticipated return). Accrued product return estimates are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Stock-Based Compensation We have applied the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , or ASC 718, to account for stock-based compensation for employees. We recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We have equity incentive plans under which various types of equity-based awards including, but not limited to, incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock unit awards and performance stock unit awards, may be granted to employees, non-employee directors, and non-employee consultants. We also have an inducement plan under which various types of equity-based awards, including non-qualified stock options and restricted stock unit awards, may be granted to new employees. We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for all stock-based awards based on the estimated grant-date fair values. For restricted stock unit awards to employees, the fair value is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention of paying cash dividends. We elected an accounting policy to record forfeitures as they occur. See Note 6, included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, for a discussion of the assumptions we used in determining the grant date fair value of options granted under the Black-Scholes option pricing model, as well as a summary of the stock option activity under our stock-based compensation plan for all years presented. Loans Payable In April 2022, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, SPV2, entered into a Loan Agreement with R-Bridge, pursuant to which the Company may be eligible to receive up to 40.0 million in term loan borrowings. Term loan borrowings were to be advanced in three tranches. The first tranche of 15.0 million was advanced in April 2022. The second tranche of 10.0 million was to become available upon achievement of either a commercial or financing 

 23 

Table of Contents 
 milestone as set forth in the Loan Agreement. The third tranche of 15.0 million was received in August 2023 upon the first commercial sale of OLINVYK in China. In July 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Loan Agreement with R-Bridge with respect to the second tranche of term loan borrowings (the Amendment ). In connection with the Amendment, the Company received a 2.0 million payment from R-Bridge and is eligible to receive an additional 8.0 million based upon achievement of certain US partnering and US commercial milestones for OLINVYK. In addition, the outstanding liability in connection with the Royalty Financing was reduced by 10.0 million. Also as part of the Amendment, (i) certain OLINVYK Chinese IP that had been previously pledged to R-Bridge under the Royalty Financing was transferred to R-Bridge, (ii) warrants that had previously been issued to R-Bridge as part of the Royalty Financing were amended to reduce the exercise price and to extend the exercise period to five years from the date of the Amendment, and (iii) the existing cap on US royalty payable to R-Bridge was increased from 10.0 million to 12.0 million (with no minimum or fixed payments). See Note 5, included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, for a discussion of the accounting treatment of the Amendment as a troubled debt restructuring. Under the relevant accounting guidance, the Loan Agreement has been accounted for as a debt instrument that will be amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the arrangement. In order to determine the amortization of the liability, we are required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be paid to R-Bridge. Consequently, we impute interest on the unamortized portion of the liability and record interest expense related to the Loan Agreement accordingly. Due to the significant judgments and factors related to the estimates of future payments under the Loan Agreement, there are significant uncertainties surrounding the amount and timing of future payments and the related interest expense we recognize. We record non-cash interest expense within our consolidated statements of operations over the term of the Loan Agreement. Recent Accounting Pronouncements None.

 Revenue We derive our revenue from providing OLINVYK to our customers and activities pursuant to our licensing agreements related to the development and commercialization of OLINVYK in China and South Korea. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded negative 21,000 in product revenue due to a returns reserve adjustment of 26,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 13,000 in product revenue from the shipment of drug product to wholesalers. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 1,000 and 28,000, respectively, in product revenue from the shipment of drug product to wholesalers. License and royalty revenue recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, relates to royalties earned on OLINVYK sales by Nhwa in China and payable to R-Bridge. License and royalty revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 relates to royalties earned on OLINVYK sales by Nhwa in China. License and royalty revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 relates to the milestone payment that became payable by Nhwa upon regulatory approval of OLINVYK in China. As noted, in 2022 we recorded a returns reserve adjustment of 0.4 million for expected returns from our wholesalers. This adjustment was due, in part, to feedback we received in October 2022 from one of our wholesalers indicating that the wholesaler intended to return a significant portion of its supply of OLINVYK. As a result, we evaluated our returns reserves and updated our estimates to reflect this expected return, as well as potential increased probability of returns from our other wholesalers. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded a returns reserve adjustment of 0.1 million for expected returns from our wholesalers. In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a returns reserve adjustment of 26,000 for expected returns from our wholesalers. These adjustments were due, in part, on our evaluation of historical purchasing trends, the remaining expiry period of inventory held by our wholesalers and the potential increase in the probability of returns from our wholesalers. As further background on our methodology with respect to returns reserves, every quarter since our launch of OLINVYK, we review the amounts of OLINVYK held at our wholesalers to evaluate the likelihood of expected product returns. In our analysis, we consider a range of factors including the level of sales from our wholesalers to hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers ASCs and other purchasers of OLINVYK, which our wholesalers report to us on a regular basis, as well as any new customer contracts. Based on information from our wholesalers, sales from our wholesalers to hospitals and ASCs, which we refer to as commercial sell through, have occurred, at a low level, every quarter since our commercial launch in February 2021. Commercial sell through of OLINVYK from our wholesalers to hospitals and ASCs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 16,800 and 65,600, respectively. Commercial sell through from our wholesalers to hospitals and ASCs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 20,300 and 58,700, respectively. In our returns reserve analysis, we also consider feedback from our wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and users of OLINVYK, as well as additional factors such as new safety data, or clinical or health economic data for OLINVYK that may affect future adoption and sales trends. Examples include OLINVYK data we announced in July 2023 with respect to reduced cost per admission for hospitals and reduced average length of hospital stay, for OLINVYK-treated patients compared to matched patients treated with other IV opioids. We also consider factors that may negatively affect sales of OLINVYK, such as the price of OLINVYK compared to conventional IV opioids, which are generally generic and available at a lower initial cost relative to OLINVYK. Other factors may include the public perception of opioids in general, as well as the FDA s and HHS policy initiatives that may limit the promotion and marketing of opioids. We incorporate these factors as we consider the need for any adjustment for slow-moving or obsolete product on a quarterly basis.

Selling, general and administrative expense Selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in our executive, finance, commercial, and other administrative areas, including expenses associated with stock based compensation and travel. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal, field sales organization, medical affairs, market research, consulting, and accounting services. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 0.7 million, or 15 , as compared to the same period in 2023 and decreased by 2.5 million, or 16 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily related to a reduction in full time employees and a reduction in marketing activities. Research and development expense Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for research and the development of our product candidates, including costs associated with the regulatory approval process. In addition, research and development expenses include salaries and related costs for our research and development personnel and stock-based compensation expense and travel expenses for such individuals. Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than 

 26 

Table of Contents 
 those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size, complexity and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and are tracked by discovery program and subsequently by product candidate once a product candidate has been selected for development. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors. Research and development expenses decreased by 2.4 million, or 56 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, and decreased by 3.2 million, or 26 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 TRV045 466 2,596 4,177 6,824 OLINVYK 87 132 503 479 TRV250 26 4 2 TRV027 6 31 47 116 Personnel-related costs 848 758 2,449 2,631 Other research and development 459 717 1,778 2,108 1,866 4,260 8,958 12,160 The decrease in research and development expenses incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by decreased spend on TRV045 studies that were completed in 2023 and due to lower personnel costs. Total other income, net Total other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.3 million as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was driven by a 0.2 million decrease in the change in fair value of the warrant liability and a 0.2 million decrease in interest income ended September 30, 2024. Total other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 3.1 million as compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase was driven by a 2.2 million increase in the change in fair value of the warrant liability and a 0.7 million decrease in interest expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically funded substantially all of our operations through the sale and issuance of our equity securities, debt securities and borrowings under debt facilities. We have also received an aggregate of 12.1 million pursuant to licensing agreements for the development and commercialization of OLINVYK in China and South Korea. At September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 605.6 million, working capital of 9.6 million, cash and cash equivalents of 13.5 million, and restricted cash of 0.6 million. In November 2020, we filed a 250.0 million shelf registration statement, which includes our at-the-market program with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC., of which there was approximately 33.7 million of available capacity as of September 30, 2024, subject to the restrictions set forth in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3. Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist of research and development expenditures, commercialization expenditures, and other selling, general and administrative expenditures. We anticipate these expenses to decrease in 2024 as we substantially eliminate commercial support of OLINVYK. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Net cash used in operating activities was 21.1 million and 27.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We incurred net losses of 17.5 million and 23.8 million for those same periods.

 Our success is dependent on finding a commercial partner for OLINVYK, continuing to advance or partner our other product candidates, including TRV045 and obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. We expect that our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to fund the Company s operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for one year after the date of this filing and therefore management has concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (21,106) (27,050) Investing activities (20) Financing activities 1,675 22,282 Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (19,431) (4,788) Net cash used in operating activities Net cash used in operating activities was 21.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 27.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes a 17.5 million net loss as compared to 23.8 million for the prior period. The net loss was 6.3 million lower due to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses from the reduction of OLINVYK commercial activities, lower research and development expenses due to TRV045 studies that were completed in 2023, and lower personnel costs. Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was 0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 20,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is due to capital expenditures related to cybersecurity and technology updates in 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities was 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily due proceeds from the Amendment, partially offset by finance lease payments. Net cash provided by financing activities was 22.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was due to 14.8 million of net proceeds from the Loan Agreement and 7.5 million from the HCW ATM Program. Operating and Capital Expenditure Requirements We have not achieved profitability since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. We expect our cash expenditures to continue to be significant in the near term as we continue to make OLINVYK available for purchase by customers, and continue to advance TRV045. Over the next twelve months, we anticipate that our total operating expenses will decrease compared to the previous twelve months.

 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, together with interest thereon, will not be sufficient to fund the Company s operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for one year after the date of this filing. Our anticipated operating expenses involve significant risks and uncertainties and are dependent on our current assessment of the extent and costs of activities required to support our operations and advance our other product candidates. In the future, we anticipate that we will need to raise substantial additional financing to fund our operations. To meet these requirements, we may seek to sell equity or convertible securities in public or private transactions that may result in significant dilution to our stockholders. We may offer and sell shares of our common stock under the existing registration statement or any registration statement we may file in the future. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible securities, these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Ultimately, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: our ability to successfully find a commercial partner for OLINVYK and commercialize our other product candidates; our ability to generate sales and other revenues from OLINVYK or any of our other product candidates, once approved, including setting an acceptable price for and obtaining adequate coverage and hospital formulary acceptance of such products; the size and growth potential of the markets for OLINVYK and our ability to serve those markets; the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates or any future product candidates, both in the United States and in territories outside the United States; the number and development requirements of any other product candidates that we may pursue; our ability to enter into collaborative agreements for the development and/or commercialization of our product candidates, including for OLINVYK; the costs, timing, and outcome of any regulatory review of OLINVYK and any future product candidates, both in the United States and in territories outside the United States; the costs, timing, and extent of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; any product liability or other lawsuits related to our products or us; the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; and the costs involved in preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending our intellectual property-related claims, both in the United States and in territories outside the United States. 
 Please see Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report and our Annual Report for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements. Other Commitments In the course of normal business operations, we have agreements with contract service providers to assist in the performance of our research and development and manufacturing activities. We can elect to discontinue the work under these agreements at any time. We also could enter into additional collaborative research, contract research, 

 29 

Table of Contents 
 manufacturing and supplier agreements in the future, which may require upfront payments and even long-term commitments of cash. We have no material non-cancelable purchase commitments with contract manufacturers or service providers as we have generally contracted on a cancelable basis. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Not required. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and our Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on our evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) as of the date of our Quarterly Report have been designed and are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. We believe that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS None ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business is subject to numerous risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this Quarterly Report, as well as general economic and business risks, together with any other documents we file with the SEC. If any of the following events actually occur or risks actually materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. There have been no material changes to our risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 , with the exception of the following risk factors. The risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report are incorporated herein by reference. Because our common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink Open Market, instead of a national securities exchange, our stockholders may experience significant volatility in the market price of our stock and have difficulty selling their shares. Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink Open Mark (the OTC Pink ), under the ticker symbol TRVN . The OTC Pink is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes and last sale prices in over-the-counter securities. Trading in shares quoted on the OTC Pink is often thin and characterized by volatility. This volatility may be caused by a variety of factors, including the lack of readily available price quotations, the absence of consistent administrative supervision of bid and ask quotations, lower trading volume and market conditions. As a result, there may be wide fluctuations in the market price of the shares of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance, and this volatility, when it occurs, may have a negative effect on the market price for our securities. Moreover, the OTC Pink is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on this platform is more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a national quotation system or stock exchange. Accordingly, our stockholders may not be able to realize a fair price of their shares when they determine to sell them or may have to hold them for a substantial period of time until the market for our common stock improves. An active trading market for our common stock may not continue to develop or be sustained. Although our common stock is listed on the OTC Pink Open Market, we cannot assure you that an active, liquid trading market for our shares will continue to develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not continue to develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell shares quickly or without depressing the market price for the shares or to sell your shares at all. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS None. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES None. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10 b 5 -1 trading

 Travel and Expense Guidelines for Consultants, Contractors, Vendors, etc. Service Providers Reasonable out-of-pocket applicable expenses incurred in accordance with Travel and Expense Policy will be reimbursed at cost to Service Providers provided that such expenses are deemed appropriate business expenses and the expenses are properly reported and accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation. Out-of-pocket expenses are those incremental expenses the Service Providers incur in the delivery of the services provided. For example, ongoing home office expenses, would not be considered out-of-pocket and are not reimbursable. Any Service Provider requesting reimbursement for any such reimbursable expense is required to complete a standard expense reimbursement form and submit the completed form, along with all supporting documentation, to the Company s designated supervisor. Appropriate supporting documentation includes the original receipt, invoice, or other similar evidence of payment. Credit card statements are not generally considered acceptable supporting documentation and should only be used in the absence of a receipt on an exception basis. All Service Providers are expected to use good business judgement when incurring reimbursable expenses. Expenses incurred shall conform to Trevena s standard expense guidelines below: a) Airline Travel - actual costs of the airfare shall be charged. Coach class is required to be booked for all flights within the United States. Any exceptions must be approved in advance by Trevena senior management or their designee. International flights must also gain prior approval from the company designee. Trevena will not pay for any first-class travel or for travel or expenses for individuals other than the Service Provider (such as spouses, partners, or family members). No hourly labor rate shall apply during travel times Trevena specifically allows such compensation. Service Providers shall schedule airline travel fourteen (14) days in advance, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Trevena. The cost of reasonable ground transportation, parking, etc. for business travel shall be charged at actual cost incurred, including any reasonable gratuities. b) Ground Transportation - in the event Service Providers utilizes his/her own vehicle to travel to the venue of a scheduled event, the current IRS mileage standard per mile shall be charged plus any tolls and/or parking costs incurred. If the Parties agree to the use of a rental car, actual costs plus fuel and tolls will be reimbursed. Single travelers renting a car must rent intermediate size automobile or smaller. When traveling in a group, renting a vehicle appropriate to the group size is reimbursable. Rail transportation may be a more convenient means of travel than airline or automobile. Fares are reimbursed at coach class rail rates unless previously approved by Trevena s senior management or their designee. c) Taxi/Car Services - Taxi or car services, such as Uber or Lyft used in connection with travel for Services will be reimbursed in full. Black Car or limousine services (including such services as Uber Black and Lyft Lux) are not reimbursable unless approved in advance by the Company s CEO or her/his designees. d) Lodging - standard, single room rates shall be charges using reasonably priced facilities. e) Meals - Reasonable costs of business meals in connection with the provision of Services will be reimbursed in full.

 all cases, the people who attended the meal and the business purpose should be written on the receipt. The cost of meals for a service provider not traveling for Services are generally not reimbursable. Reimbursement will be on the basis of actual costs including taxes and reasonable tips (15-20 ). To comply with tax regulations, the following information must be included on the expense report for all business meals: Name, title, and company of all attendees Name and location of establishment where event took place Amount and date of expense Specific business topic(s) Detailed credit card slip outlining charges must be attached Guidelines for total or per-meal expenses are as follows: Breakfast: 15.00 dollars Lunch: 20.00 dollars Dinner: 50.00 dollars; or Total per Day: 85.00 dollars f) Incidentals - incidentals such as personal items, in-room movies and other forms of entertainment are not reimbursable by Trevena, as well as personal expenses, without exception, such as health club or spa, clothing, souvenirs, gifts, flowers, dependent care, optional travel/life insurance and pet care. Expense Reporting and Documentation Requirements Original receipts are required for all expenses over 25.00 USD, or equivalent, and must indicate vendor name, location, date of expense, description of item(s) or service(s), and proof of payment (i.e. check, credit card imprint, paid cash receipt). The original receipt completed by the vendor must be attached to the expense report when submitted. Receipts must be made out to the employee, not the Company. If a receipt is not available, a copy of the credit card statement and a full explanation of the expense and reason for the missing original receipt are required. Photocopies of receipts will be accepted only with a detailed explanation as to why the original is unavailable. The IRS code requires reimbursable expenditures to be supported by adequate records which clearly establish that they were (i) ordinary and necessary, (ii) reasonable in amount and (iii) incurred for a valid business purpose. As such, please provide the following information on your expense report: a) the identity of the vendor or supplier must be indicated; b) the business purpose for the expenditure must be stated; and, c) the identity and business relationship of others participating in the event (e.g., entertainment, business meal, etc.) covered by the expenditure must be stated Original itemized receipts (e.g., itemized hotel bills, airline passenger receipt coupons, automobile rental invoices, taxi fares, parking receipts, telephone bills) must be submitted in an organized manner maintaining a chronological order. No receipts are required for mileage allowances.

 In the rare event that neither a receipt nor proof of payment is available (accidentally destroyed, lost, etc.) the specific reimbursement must be approved by the Service Provider direct supervisor.
