 segments: contract talent solutions, permanent placement talent solutions, and Protiviti. Revenues are recognized when promised goods or services are delivered to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Service revenues, as presented on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, represent services rendered to customers less variable consideration, such as sales adjustments and allowances. Reimbursements, including those related to travel and out-of-pocket expenses, are also included in service revenues, and equivalent amounts of reimbursable expenses are included in costs of services. 
 Contract talent solutions revenues. Contract talent solutions revenues from contracts with customers are recognized in the amount to which the Company has a right to invoice when the services are rendered by the Company s engagement professionals. The substantial majority of engagement professionals placed on assignment by the Company are the Company s legal employees while they are working on assignments. The Company pays all related costs of employment, including workers compensation insurance, state and federal unemployment taxes, social security, and certain fringe benefits. The Company assumes the risk of acceptability of its employees to its customers.

 -day guarantee period. These amounts are established based primarily on historical data and are recorded as liabilities. Fees to clients are generally calculated as a percentage of the new employee s annual compensation. No fees for permanent placement talent solutions services are charged to employment candidates. 
 Protiviti revenues. Protiviti s consulting services are generally provided on a time-and-material basis or fixed-fee basis. Revenues earned under time-and-material arrangements and fixed-fee arrangements are recognized using a proportional performance method. Revenue is measured using cost incurred relative to total estimated cost for the engagement to measure progress towards satisfying the Company s performance obligations. Cost incurred represents work performed and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Protiviti s consulting services generally contain one or more performance obligation(s) which are satisfied over a period of time. Revenues are recognized over time as the performance obligations are satisfied, because the services provided do not have any alternative use to the Company, and contracts generally include language giving the Company an enforceable right to payment for services provided to date. 
 The Company periodically evaluates the need to provide for any losses on these projects, and losses are recognized when it is probable that a loss will be incurred.

 On April 6, 2018, Plaintiff Shari Dorff, on her own behalf and on behalf of a putative class of allegedly similarly situated individuals, filed a complaint against the Company in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. In addition to certain claims individual to Plaintiff Dorff, the complaint alleges that salaried recruiters based in California have been misclassified as exempt employees and seeks an unspecified amount for: unpaid wages resulting from such alleged misclassification; alleged failure to provide a reasonable opportunity to take meal periods and rest breaks; alleged failure to pay wages on a timely basis both during employment and upon separation; alleged failure to comply with California requirements regarding wage statements and record-keeping; and alleged improper denial of expense reimbursement. Plaintiff Dorff also seeks an unspecified amount of other damages, attorneys fees, and penalties, including but not limited to statutory penalties on behalf of herself and other allegedly aggrieved employees as defined by PAGA. At this stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict the outcome of or a range of loss, should a loss occur, from this proceeding and, accordingly, amounts have been provided in the Company s Financial Statements. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations and the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against the litigation. 
 The Company is involved in a number of other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. While management does not expect any of these other matters to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows, litigation is subject to certain inherent uncertainties.

ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Certain information contained in Management s Discussion and Analysis and in other parts of this report may be deemed forward-looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the future operating results or financial positions of Robert Half Inc. (the Company ). Forward-looking statements are not guarantees or promises that goals or targets will be met. These statements may be identified by words such as anticipate, potential, estimate, forecast, target, project, plan, intend, believe, expect, should, could, would, may, might, will, or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking information about the Company s environmental, social, and governance ESG and compliance programs, including targets or goals, may not be considered material for the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC or other mandatory reporting purposes and may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, on internal controls, diligence, or processes that are evolving, on representations reviewed or provided by third parties, and on assumptions that are subject to change in the future. Forward-looking statements are estimates only, based on management s current expectations, currently available information and current strategy, plans, or forecasts, and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict and often beyond our control and are inherently uncertain. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, outcomes, or the timing of these results or outcomes, to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: changes to or new interpretations of United States of America U.S. or international tax regulations; the global financial and economic situation; changes in levels of unemployment and other economic conditions in the U.S. or foreign countries where the Company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of candidates for contract employment or the Company s ability to attract candidates; the development, proliferation and adoption of artificial intelligence AI by the Company and the third parties it serves; the entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the Company to maintain existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand for the Company s services, on the Company s ability to maintain its margins; the possibility of the Company incurring liability for its activities, including the activities of its engagement professionals, or for events impacting its engagement professionals on clients premises; the possibility that adverse publicity could impact the Company s ability to attract and retain clients and candidates; the success of the Company in attracting, training, and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; the Company s ability to comply with governmental regulations affecting personnel services businesses in particular or employer/employee relationships in general; whether there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; the Company s reliance on short-term contracts for a significant percentage of its business; litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities, including litigation that may be disclosed from time to time in the Company s SEC filings; the impact of extreme weather conditions on the Company and its candidates and clients; the ability of the Company to manage its international operations and comply with foreign laws and regulations; the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the possibility that the additional costs the Company will incur as a result of health care or other reform legislation may adversely affect the Company s profit margins or the demand for the Company s services; the possibility that the Company s computer and communications hardware and software systems could be damaged or their service interrupted or the Company could experience a cybersecurity breach; and the possibility that the Company may fail to maintain adequate financial and management controls, and as a result suffer errors in its financial reporting. Additionally, with respect to Protiviti, other risks and uncertainties include the fact that future success will depend on its ability to retain employees and attract clients; there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for broad-based consulting, regulatory compliance, technology services, public sector or other high-demand advisory services; failure to produce projected revenues could adversely affect financial results; and there is the possibility of involvement in litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities. Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company s business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update information in this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, and notwithstanding any historical practice of doing so. 
 Executive Overview 
 Revenue and net income results for the third quarter exceeded management s expectations, driven by strong results from Protiviti, which posted sequential and year-on-year revenue gains. While client budgets remain constrained and decision cycles extended, business confidence levels are improving, aided by continuing progress on inflation and the beginning of a global rate-cutting cycle. Consistent with this trend, the Company s recent weekly sequential results in contract talent have reflected increased stability. 
 During the first three quarters of 2024, service revenues were 4.41 billion, a decrease of 10.3 from the prior year. Net income was 197 million, and diluted net income per share was 1.91. 
 
 19 

Demand for the Company s contract talent solutions, permanent placement talent solutions, and Protiviti is largely dependent upon general economic and labor trends, both domestically and abroad. The U.S. real gross domestic product increased 2.8 during the first three quarters of 2024, while the unemployment rate increased from 3.7 for December 2023 to 4.1 at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Although sales cycles are still elongated, job openings remain significantly above historical averages, indicating substantial pent-up demand for talent. While the tightness of the labor supply has eased somewhat, the unemployment rate in the U.S. for those with a college degree is still only 2.3 , with rates for many in-demand accounting, finance and IT positions even lower. The Company is confident about its ability to weather the current global macroeconomic environment and its growth prospects as the macro landscape improves. 
 The Company continues to invest in technology and innovation to fuel its core business strategy. The Company s proprietary Recruiters plus award-winning AI strategy offers significant added value to its clients. 
 The Company monitors various economic indicators and business trends in all of the countries in which it operates to anticipate demand for the Company s services. These trends are evaluated to determine the appropriate level of investment, including personnel, which will best position the Company for success in the current and future global macroeconomic environment. The Company s investments in headcount are typically structured to proactively support and align with expected revenue growth trends and productivity metrics. Visibility into future revenues is limited not only due to the dependence on macroeconomic and labor market conditions noted above, but also because of the relatively short duration of the Company s client engagements. Accordingly, the Company s headcount and other investments are typically assessed on at least a quarterly basis. During the first three quarters of 2024, the Company decreased headcount for its contract talent solutions and permanent placement talent solutions segments, when compared to prior year-end levels. In addition, the full-time headcount for Protiviti increased when compared to prior year-end levels.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note B New Accounting Pronouncements to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 The Company analyzes its operating results for three reportable segments: contract talent solutions, permanent placement talent solutions, and Protiviti. The contract talent solutions and permanent placement talent solutions segments provide engagement professionals and full-time personnel, respectively, for finance and accounting, technology, marketing and creative, legal, administrative and customer support, and executive search. The Protiviti segment provides internal audit, risk, business, and technology consulting solutions. 
 Demand for the Company s services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor trends both domestically and abroad. Because of the inherent difficulty in predicting economic trends, future demand for the Company s services cannot be forecast with certainty. 
 The Company s talent solutions segments conduct operations through offices in the U.S. and 17 other countries, while Protiviti has offices in the U.S. and 13 other countries.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The financial results of the Company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP and the rules of the SEC. To help readers understand the Company s financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with the following non-GAAP measures: adjusted gross margin; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; combined segment income; and as adjusted revenue growth rates. 
 The following measures: adjusted gross margin and adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, include gains and losses on investments held to fund the Company s obligations under employee deferred compensation plans. The Company provides these measures because they are used by management to review its operational results. 
 Combined segment income is income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets. The Company provides combined segment income because it is how management evaluates performance. 
 As adjusted revenue growth rates represent year-over-year revenue growth rates after removing the impacts on reported revenues from the changes in the number of billing days and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company provides this data because it focuses on the Company s revenue growth rates attributable to operating activities and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time. The impacts from the changes in billing days and foreign currency exchange rates are calculated as follows: 
 Billing days impact is calculated by dividing each comparative period s reported revenues by the number of billing days for that period to arrive at a per billing day amount. Same billing day growth rates are then calculated based on the per billing day amounts. Management calculates a global, weighted-average number of billing days for each reporting period based upon inputs from all countries and all functional specializations and segments. 
 Foreign currency impact is calculated by retranslating current period international revenues using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year s comparable period. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company s industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company s non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided on the following pages. 
 Refer to Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Company s results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Service Revenues. The Company s revenues were 1.47 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6.3 compared to 1.56 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues from U.S. operations decreased 5.2 to 1.15 billion (78.2 of total revenue) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.21 billion (77.3 of total revenue) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues from international operations decreased 10.2 to 319 million (21.8 of total revenue) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 355 million (22.7 of total revenue) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. 
 Contract talent solutions revenues were 831 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreasing by 11.9 compared to revenues of 943 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Key drivers of contract talent solutions revenues include average hourly bill rates and the number of hours worked by the Company s engagement professionals on client engagements. The decrease in contract talent solutions revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a 12.8 decrease in the number of hours worked by the Company s engagement professionals, partially offset by a 1.4 increase in average bill rates. On an as adjusted basis, contract talent solutions revenues decreased 13.2 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. In the U.S., revenues in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 12.4 on an as reported basis, and decreased 13.7 on an as adjusted basis, compared to the third quarter of 2023. International revenues for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 10.6 on an as reported basis, and decreased 11.7 on an as adjusted basis compared to the third quarter of 2023.

Permanent placement talent solutions revenues were 123 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreasing by 11.9 compared to revenues of 140 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Key drivers of permanent placement talent solutions revenues consist of the number of candidate placements and average fees earned per placement. The decrease in permanent placement talent revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was due to a 13.6 decrease in the number of placements, partially offset by a 1.7 increase in average fees earned per placement. On an as adjusted basis, permanent placement talent solutions revenues decreased 13.2 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. In the U.S., revenues for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 9.0 on an as reported basis, and decreased 10.4 on an as adjusted basis, compared to the third quarter of 2023. International revenues for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 18.6 on an as reported basis and decreased 19.8 on an as adjusted basis, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Historically, demand for permanent placement talent solutions is even more sensitive to economic and labor market conditions than demand for contract talent solutions, and this is expected to continue. 
 Protiviti revenues were 511 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increasing by 6.4 compared to revenues of 481 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Key drivers of Protiviti revenues are the billable hours worked by consultants on client engagements and average hourly bill rates. The increase in Protiviti revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was due to a 4.4 increase in average hourly bill rates, and a 2.0 increase in billable hours. On an as adjusted basis, Protiviti revenues increased 4.5 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. In the U.S., revenues in the third quarter of 2024 increased 9.3 on an as reported basis, and increased 7.6 on an as adjusted basis, compared to the third quarter of 2023. International revenues for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 5.6 on an as reported basis and decreased 8.1 on an as adjusted basis, compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 A reconciliation of the non-GAAP year-over-year revenue growth rates to the as reported year-over-year revenue growth rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024, is presented in the following table: 
 Global United States International Contract talent solutions

 Gross Margin . The Company s gross margin dollars were 572 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down 10.8 from 641 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. 
 Gross margin dollars for contract talent solutions represent revenues less costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and benefit costs for engagement professionals, and reimbursable expenses. The key drivers of gross margin are: i) pay-bill spreads, which represent the differential between wages paid to engagement professionals and amounts billed to clients; ii) fringe costs, which are primarily composed of payroll taxes and benefit costs; and iii) conversion revenues, which are earned when a contract position converts to a permanent position with the Company s client. 
 Gross margin dollars for contract talent solutions were 323 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreasing by 13.9 from 375 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for contract talent solutions were 38.9 in the third quarter of 2024, down from 39.8 in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to higher fringe costs and lower pay-bill spreads. 
 
 22 

Gross margin dollars for permanent placement talent solutions represent revenues less reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for permanent placement talent solutions were 123 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down 11.9 from 140 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Because reimbursable expenses for permanent placement talent solutions are de minimis, the decrease in gross margin dollars is substantially explained by the decrease in revenues previously discussed. 
 Gross margin dollars for Protiviti represent revenues less costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, benefit costs, and reimbursable expenses. The primary drivers of Protiviti s gross margin are: i) the relative composition of and number of professional staff and their respective pay and bill rates; and ii) staff utilization, which is the relationship of time spent on client engagements in proportion to the total time available for the Company s Protiviti staff. Gross margin dollars for Protiviti were 126 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As a percentage of revenues, reported gross margin dollars for Protiviti were 24.6 in the third quarter of 2024, down from 26.2 in the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of revenues, adjusted gross margin dollars for Protiviti were 25.8 in the third quarter of 2024, up from 25.6 in the third quarter of 2023.

Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for contract talent solutions, on an as reported basis, were 318 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increasing by 3.7 from 307 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, reported selling, general and administrative expenses for contract talent solutions were 38.3 in the third quarter of 2024, up from 32.5 in the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of revenues, adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses for contract talent solutions were 35.8 in the third quarter of 2024, up from 33.6 in the third quarter of 2023, due primarily to negative leverage as revenues decreased as a result of economic conditions during the quarter. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for permanent placement talent solutions were 113 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreasing by 5.0 from 119 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 (1) Changes in the Company s employee deferred compensation plan obligations related to talent solutions operations are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, while the related investment (income) loss is presented separately. The non-GAAP financial adjustments shown in the table above are to reclassify investment (income) loss from investments held in employee deferred compensation trusts to the same line item that includes the corresponding change in obligation. These adjustments have no impact on income before income taxes. 
 (Income) Loss from Investments Held in Employee Deferred Compensation Trusts . Under the Company s employee deferred compensation plans, employees direct the investment of their account balances, and the Company invests amounts held in the associated investment trusts consistent with these directions. As realized and unrealized investment gains and losses occur, the Company s employee deferred compensation plan obligations change and adjustments are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, or in the case of Protiviti, costs of services. This incremental expense is completely offset by investment income related to the employee deferred compensation trust. The value of the related investment trust assets also changes by the equal and offsetting amount, leaving no net costs to the Company. The Company s (income) loss from investments held in employee deferred compensation trusts consists primarily of unrealized and realized gains and losses, and dividend income from trust investments and is presented separately on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company s (income) loss from investments held in employee deferred compensation trusts was income of 29 million and a loss of 14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income from trust investments during the third quarter of 2024 was due to positive market returns. 
 Income Before Income Taxes and Segment Income. The Company s total income before income taxes was 95 million, or 6.5 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down from 136 million, or 8.7 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Combined segment income was 90 million, or 6.2 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down from 130 million, or 8.3 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Company s non-GAAP combined segment income is summarized as follows (in thousands):

Provision for income taxes . The provision for income taxes was 31.2 and 29.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The higher tax rate for 2024 can primarily be attributed to the impact of nondeductible expenses. 
 In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development established an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting and agreed on a two-pillar solution Pillar Two to global taxation, focusing on global profit allocation and a 15 global minimum effective tax rate. The Company continues to monitor developments and evaluate any potential tax impacts from Pillar Two. There were no material impacts for the three months ended September 30, 2024, nor are any expected throughout the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Service Revenues. The Company s revenues were 4.41 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 10.3 compared to 4.92 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues from U.S. operations decreased 10.0 to 3.44 billion (77.9 of total revenue) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.82 billion (77.7 of total revenue) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues from international operations decreased 11.1 to 976 million (22.1 of total revenue) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.10 billion (22.3 of total revenue) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. 
 Contract talent solutions revenues were 2.57 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreasing by 14.5 compared to revenues of 3.01 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Key drivers of contract talent solutions revenues include average hourly bill rates and the number of hours worked by the Company s engagement professionals on client engagements. The decrease in contract talent solutions revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a 15.3 decrease in the number of hours worked by the Company s engagement professionals, partially offset by a 1.6 increase in average bill rates. On an as adjusted basis, contract talent solutions revenues in the first three quarters of 2024 decreased 14.7 compared to the first three quarters of 2023. In the U.S., revenues in the first three quarters of 2024 decreased 15.9 on an as reported basis, and decreased 16.2 on an as adjusted basis, compared to the first three quarters of 2023. International revenues for the first three quarters of 2024 decreased 9.6 on an as reported basis, and decreased 9.5 on an as adjusted basis, compared to the first three quarters of 2023. 
 Permanent placement talent solutions revenues were 379 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreasing by 15.0 compared to revenues of 446 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Key drivers of permanent placement talent solutions revenues consist of the number of candidate placements and average fees earned per placement. The decrease in permanent placement staffing revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due to an 18.0 decrease in the number of placements, partially offset by a 3.0 increase in average fees earned per placement. On an as adjusted basis, permanent placement talent solutions revenues decreased 15.1 for the first three quarters of 2024, compared to the first three quarters of 2023. In the U.S., revenues for the first three quarters of 2024 decreased 13.5 on an as reported basis, and decreased 13.8 on an as adjusted basis, compared to the first three quarters of 2023. International revenues for the first three quarters of 2024 decreased 18.6 on an as reported basis, and decreased 18.4 on an as adjusted basis, compared to the first three quarters of 2023. Historically, demand for permanent placement talent solutions is even more sensitive to economic and labor market conditions than demand for contract talent solutions and this is expected to continue. 
 Protiviti revenues were 1.46 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreasing by 0.3 compared to revenues of 1.47 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Key drivers of Protiviti revenues are the billable hours worked by consultants on client engagements and average hourly bill rates. The decrease in Protiviti revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due to a 3.0 decrease in billable hours, partially offset by a 2.7 increase in average hourly bill rates. On an as adjusted basis, Protiviti revenues decreased 0.6 for the first three quarters of 2024, compared to the first three quarters of 2023. In the U.S., revenues in the first three quarters of 2024 increased 2.5 on an as reported basis, and increased 2.1 on an as adjusted basis, compared to the first three quarters of 2023. International revenues in the first three quarters of 2024 decreased 11.2 on an as reported basis, and decreased 11.5 on an as adjusted basis, compared to the first three quarters of 2023.

 Gross Margin . The Company s gross margin dollars were 1.71 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down 14.0 from 1.99 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. 
 Gross margin dollars for contract talent solutions represent revenues less costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and benefit costs for engagement professionals, and reimbursable expenses. The key drivers of gross margin are: i) pay-bill spreads, which represent the differential between wages paid to engagement professionals and amounts billed to clients; ii) fringe costs, which are primarily composed of payroll taxes and benefit costs; and iii) conversion revenues, which are earned when a contract position converts to a permanent position with the Company s client. 
 Gross margin dollars for contract talent solutions were 1.01 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down 15.7 from 1.20 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for contract talent solutions were 39.3 in the first three quarters of 2024, down from 39.8 in the first three quarters of 2023. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to higher fringe costs and lower pay-bill spreads. 
 Gross margin dollars for permanent placement talent solutions represent revenues less reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for permanent placement talent solutions were 378 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down 15.0 from 445 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Because reimbursable expenses for permanent placement talent solutions are de minimis, the decrease in gross margin dollars is substantially explained by the decrease in revenues previously discussed. 
 Gross margin dollars for Protiviti represent revenues less costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, benefit costs, and reimbursable expenses. The primary drivers of Protiviti s gross margin are: i) the relative composition of and number of professional staff and their respective pay and bill rates; and ii) staff utilization, which is the relationship of time spent on client engagements in proportion to the total time available for the Company s Protiviti staff. Gross margin dollars for Protiviti were 323 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down 7.3 from 348 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, reported gross margin dollars for Protiviti were 22.1 in the first three quarters of 2024, down from 23.8 in the first three quarters of 2023. As a percentage of revenues, adjusted gross margin dollars for Protiviti were 23.3 in the first three quarters of 2024, down from 24.3 in the first three quarters of 2023. The year-over-year decrease in adjusted gross margin percentage was primarily due to the relative composition of and number of professional staff and their respective pay and bill rates

 (1) Changes in the Company s deferred compensation obligations related to Protiviti operations are included in costs of services, while the related investment income is presented separately. The non-GAAP financial adjustments shown in the table above are to reclassify investment income from investments held in employee deferred compensation trusts to the same line item that includes the corresponding change in obligation. These adjustments have no impact on income before income taxes. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . The Company s selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, variable overhead, depreciation, and occupancy costs. The Company s reported selling, general and administrative expenses were 1.53 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down 3.6 from 1.59 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, reported selling, general and administrative expenses were 34.7 in the first three quarters of 2024, up from 32.3 in the first three quarters of 2023. The Company s adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were 1.46 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down 6.1 from 1.56 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

As a percentage of revenues, reported selling, general and administrative expenses for contract talent solutions were 37.2 in the first three quarters of 2024, up from 32.8 in the first three quarters of 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses for contract talent solutions, on an adjusted basis, were 896 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down 6.3 from 955 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses for contract talent solutions were 34.8 in the first three quarters of 2024, up from 31.8 in the first three quarters of 2023, due primarily to negative leverage as revenues decreased as a result of economic conditions.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for permanent placement talent solutions were 346 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreasing by 9.8 from 384 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, reported selling, general and administrative expenses for permanent placement talent solutions were 91.3 in the first three quarters of 2024, up from 86.1 in the first three quarters of 2023. As a percentage of revenues, adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses for permanent placement talent solutions were 89.2 in the first three quarters of 2024, up from 85.3 in the first three quarters of 2023, due primarily to negative leverage as revenues decreased as a result of economic conditions.

(Income) Loss from Investments Held in Employee Deferred Compensation Trusts . Under the Company s employee deferred compensation plans, employees direct the investment of their account balances, and the Company invests amounts held in the associated investment trusts consistent with these directions. As realized and unrealized investment gains and losses occur, the Company s employee deferred compensation plan obligations change and adjustments are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, or in the case of Protiviti, costs of services. The value of the related investment trust assets also changes by the equal and offsetting amount, leaving no net costs to the Company. The Company s income from investments held in employee deferred compensation trusts consists primarily of unrealized and realized gains and losses, and dividend income from trust investments and is presented separately on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company s income from investments held in employee deferred compensation trusts was 88 million and 41 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income from trust investments was due to positive market returns during the first three quarters of 2024. 
 Income Before Income Taxes and Segment Income. The Company s total income before income taxes was 282 million, or 6.4 of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down from 456 million, or 9.3 of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Combined segment income was 266 million, or 6.0 of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down from 441 million, or 9.0 of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Company s non-GAAP combined segment income is summarized as follows (in thousands):

 The following table provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP combined segment income to reported income before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 of Revenue 2023 of Revenue Income before income taxes 282,335 6.4 456,452 9.3 Interest income, net (16,990) (0.4 (17,276) (0.3) Amortization of intangible assets 913 0.0 2,162 0.0 Combined segment income 266,258 6.0 441,338 9.0 
 Provision for income taxes . The provision for income taxes was 30.1 and 29.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The higher tax rate for 2024 can primarily be attributed to the impact of nondeductible expenses. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The change in the Company s liquidity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, is primarily the net effect of funds generated by operations and the funds used for capital expenditures, investment in employee deferred compensation trusts, net of redemptions from employee deferred compensation trusts, repurchases of common stock, and payment of dividends. 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 570 million and 729 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Operating activities provided cash flows of 255 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by 58 million and 362 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively. Operating activities provided cash flows of 522 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, offset by 91 million and 354 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing reported cash and cash equivalents by 3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a decrease of 6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 30 

Operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was composed of net income of 197 million adjusted upward for non-cash items of 27 million and net cash provided by changes in working capital of 31 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was composed of net income of 324 million adjusted upward for non-cash items of 75 million and net cash provided by changes in working capital of 123 million. 
 Investing activities Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 58 million. This was composed of capital expenditures of 42 million and investments in employee deferred compensation trusts of 50 million, partially offset by proceeds from employee deferred compensation trust redemptions of 34 million. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 91 million. This was composed of capital expenditures of 34 million, investments in employee deferred compensation trusts of 89 million, and 1 million in payments related to an acquisition, partially offset by proceeds from employee deferred compensation trust redemptions of 33 million. 
 Capital expenditures, including 23 million for cloud computing arrangements, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 65 million, approximately 58 of which represented investments in software initiatives and technology infrastructure, both of which are important to the Company s sustainability and future growth opportunities. Capital expenditures for cloud computing arrangements are included in cash flows from operating activities on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Capital expenditures included amounts spent on tenant improvements and furniture and equipment in the Company s leased offices. The Company currently expects that 2024 capital expenditures will range from 80 million to 90 million, of which 45 million to 55 million relates to software initiatives and technology infrastructure, including capitalized costs related to implementation of cloud computing arrangements. 
 Financing activities Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 362 million. This included repurchases of 196 million in common stock and 166 million in dividends paid to stockholders. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 354 million. This included repurchases of 199 million in common stock and 155 million in dividends paid to stockholders. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time to time, up to 8.3 million additional shares of the Company s common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased 2.5 million shares, at a cost of 171 million, and 2.4 million shares, at a cost of 175 million, on the open market, respectively. Additional stock repurchases were made in connection with employee stock plans, whereby Company shares were tendered by employees for the payment of exercise price and applicable statutory withholding taxes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, such repurchases totaled 0.3 million shares, at a cost of 22 million, and 0.3 million shares, at a cost of 22 million, respectively. Repurchases of shares have been funded with cash generated from operations. 
 The Company s working capital at September 30, 2024, included 570 million in cash and cash equivalents, and 885 million in net accounts receivable, both of which will be a significant source of ongoing liquidity and financial resilience. The Company expects that internally generated cash will be sufficient to support the working capital needs of the Company, the Company s fixed payments, dividends, and other obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis. 
 There is limited visibility into future cash flows as the Company s revenues and net income are largely dependent on macroeconomic conditions. The Company s variable direct costs related to its contract talent solutions business will largely fluctuate in relation to its revenues. 
 The Company has an unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement of 100.0 million, which matures in May 2026. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest in accordance with the terms of the borrowing and will be calculated according to the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin. The Credit Agreement is subject to certain financial covenants, and the Company was in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2024. There were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023. 
 On October 29, 2024, the Company announced a quarterly dividend of 0.53 per share to be paid to all shareholders of record as of November 25, 2024. The dividend will be paid on December 13, 2024.

Material Cash Requirements from Contractual Obligations 
 Leases. As of September 30, 2024, the Company reported current and long-term operating lease liabilities of 66 million and 173 million, respectively. These balances consist of the minimum rental commitments for October 2024 and thereafter, discounted to reflect the Company s cost of borrowing, under noncancellable lease contracts executed as of September 30, 2024. 
 The majority of these leases are for real estate. In the event the Company vacates a location prior to the end of the lease term, the Company may be obliged to continue making lease payments. For further information, see Note G Leases to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I Item 1 of this report. 
 Purchase Obligations. Purchase obligations are discussed in more detail in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to the Company s contractual purchase obligations during the first three quarters of 2024. 
 Employee Deferred Compensation Plan. As of September 30, 2024, the Company reported employee deferred compensation plan obligations of 664 million in its accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balances are due to employees based upon elections they make at the time of deferring their funds. The timing of these payments may change based upon factors including termination of the Company s employment arrangement with a participant. These obligations are funded through contributions to investment trusts, whose assets as of September 30, 2024, were substantially equal to the obligations. Assets of these plans are held by an independent trustee for the sole benefit of participating employees and consist of money market funds and mutual funds. For further information, see Note J Employee Deferred Compensation Plan Obligations to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I Item 1 of this report. 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Because a portion of the Company s net revenues is derived from its operations outside the U.S. and is denominated in local currencies, the Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the Company s foreign subsidiaries. Exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar value of the Company s reported revenues, expenses, earnings, assets and liabilities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 22.1 of the Company s revenues were generated outside of the U.S. These operations transact business in their functional currency, which is the same as their local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the Australian dollar and Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar and Euro, have an impact on the Company s reported results. Under GAAP, revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Consequently, as the value of the U.S. dollar changes relative to the currencies of the Company s international markets, the Company s reported results vary. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, the U.S. dollar fluctuated, and generally strengthened, against the primary currencies in which the Company conducts business, compared to one year ago. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported service revenues by 4.6 million, or 0.1 , in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the same period one year ago. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar also affected the reported level of expenses incurred in the Company s international operations. Because substantially all the Company s international operations generated revenues and incurred expenses within the same country and currency, the effect of lower reported revenues is largely offset by the decrease in reported operating expenses. Reported net income was 0.8 million, or 0.3 , lower in the first three quarters of 2024, compared to the same period one year ago due to the effect of currency exchange rates. If currency exchange rates were to remain at September 30, 2024 levels throughout the remainder of 2024, the currency impact on the Company s full-year reported revenues and operating expenses would be consistent with the first three quarters of 2024 results. Should current trends continue, the impact to reported net income would be immaterial. 
 Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar amount of the Company s stockholders equity. The assets and liabilities of the Company s international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Although currency fluctuations impact the Company s reported results and shareholders equity, such fluctuations generally do not affect cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses. The Company generally has few cross-border transfers of funds, consisting of dividends from the Company s foreign subsidiaries, and transfers to and from the U.S. related to intercompany working capital requirements.

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management, including the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In accordance with this review, no material changes to controls and procedures were made in the three months ended September 30, 2024.
