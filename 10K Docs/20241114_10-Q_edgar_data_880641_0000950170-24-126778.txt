 of Bank of Clarke (the Bank ). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts and t ransactions between the Company and the Bank have been eliminated. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current year presentations. None of the reclassifications were of a material nature and they had no effect on prior year net income or shareholders' equity. On January 1, 2024, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-02, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method," ("ASC 323"). These amendments allow reporting entities to elect to account for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. The adoption resulted in an adjustment of thousand, which reduced the investment balance and shareholders' equity. Th e Company invests in qualified affordable housing projects. The general purpose of these investments is to encourage and assist participants in investing in low-income residential rental properties located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, develop and implement strategies to maintain projects as low-income housing, provide tax credits and other tax benefits to investors, and to pre serve and protect project assets.

The reference point for determining when securities are in an unrealized loss position is month end. As such, it is possible that a security's market value exceeded its amortized cost on other days during the past twelve-month period. There were debt securities with a fair value below the amortized cost basis, totaling million of aggregate fair value as of September 30, 2024. The Company concluded that a credit loss does not exist in its securities portfolio at September 30, 2024 based on the fact that (1) changes in fair value were caused by non-credit-related factors, primarily fluctuations in interest rates, (2) securities with unrealized losses had generally high credit quality, (3) the Company intends to hold these investments in debt securities to maturity and it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be required to sell these investments before a recovery of its investment, and (4) issuers have continued to make timely payments of principal and interest. Additionally, the Company s mortgage-backed securities and obligations of U.S. government corporations and agencies are entirely issued by either U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. Collectively, these entities provide a guarantee, which is either explicitly or implicitly supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, that investors in such mortgage-backed securities will receive timely principal and interest payments. Securities having carrying v alues of mi llion and million at September 30, 2024 were pledged as security for trust accounts and for borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window, respectively.

The Company did not identify any significant changes in the extent to which collateral secures its collateral dependent loans, whether in the form of general deterioration or from other factors during the period ended September 30, 2024. The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually to classify the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. The following table presents risk ratings by loan portfolio segment and origination year. Description of these ratings are as follows: 

Pass 
 
 Pass loans exhibit acceptable history of profits, cash flow ability and liquidity. Sufficient cash flow exists to service the loan. All obligations have been paid by the borrower in an as agreed manner. 

Special Mention 
 
 Special mention loans exhibit negative trends and potential weakness that, if left uncorrected, may negatively affect the borrower s ability to repay its obligations. Loan relationships with stale financial statements at their annual review will also cause a downgrade to special mention until current financials are received and upgrade is approved. The risk of default is not imminent and the borrower still demonstrates sufficient financial strength to service debt. 

Classified 
 
 Classified loans include loans rated Substandard, Doubtful and Loss. 

Substandard loans exhibit well defined weaknesses resulting in a higher probability of default. The borrowers exhibit adverse financial trends and a diminishing ability or willingness to service debt. 

Doubtful loans exhibit all of the characteristics inherent in substandard loans; however given the severity of weaknesses, the collection of 100 of the principal is unlikely under current conditions. 

Loss loans are considered uncollectible over a reasonable period of time and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted.

None of the loans that were modified during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 had defaulted and the loans remain current with contractual payments as of September 30, 2024. Management defines default as over days contractually past due under the modified terms, the foreclosure and/or repossession of the collateral, or the charge-off of the loan during the twelve-month period subsequent to the modification. The financial effects of the term extensions during the prior-year period added a weighted average of years to the life of loans which reduced the payment amounts for the borrowers.

Certain financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets usually result from the application of lower of cost or market accounting or write downs of individual assets. 

 25 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 nonrecurring fair value adjustments were recorded on loans held for sale during nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. Individually Evaluated Collateral-Dependent Loans: The estimated fair value of individually evaluated collateral-dependent loans is based on the value of the underlying collateral or the value of the underlying collateral, less estimated cost to sell, as appropriate. Collateral is generally real estate; however, collateral may include vehicles, equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, and/or other business assets. The value of real estate collateral is determined using a market valuation approach based on an appraisal conducted by an independent, licensed appraiser. The value of other assets may also be based on an appraisal, market quotations, aging schedules or other sources. Collateral-dependent individually evaluated loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as a provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. At September 30, 2024 there was one collateral-dependent relationship totaling thousand, which was individually evaluated and being carried at fair value of thousand. This relationship consists of three commercial business loans collateralized by equipment. There were no individually evaluated collateral dependent loans recorded at fair value at December 31, 2023. Other Real Estate Owned: Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at the fair value of the property, less estimated selling costs, establishing a new costs basis. Any write-downs based on the asset s fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the allowance for credit losses. Costs of significant property improvements are capitalized, whereas costs relating to holding property are expensed. The portion of interest costs relating to development of real estate is capitalized. Valuations are periodically obtained by management, and any subsequent write-downs are recorded as a charge to operations, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of a property to fair value less cost to sell. The fair value measurement of real estate held in other real estate owned is assessed in the same manner as collateral-dependent loans described above. We believe that the fair value follows the provisions of GAAP. The Company held other real estate owned at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Repossessed Assets: Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at the fair value of the asset, less estimated selling costs, establishing a new costs basis. Any write-downs based on the asset s fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the allowance for credit losses. Costs of significant improvements are capitalized, whereas costs relating to holding assets are expensed. Valuations are periodically obtained by management, and any subsequent write-downs are recorded as a charge to operations, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of an asset to fair value less cost to sell. The fair value measurement of repossessed assets is assessed in the same manner as collateral dependent loans described above. We believe that the fair value follows the provisions of GAAP. The Company held thousand and thousand at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Repossessed assets are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company designated the fair value swap under the portfolio layer method ("PLM"). Under this method, the hedged item is designated as a hedged layer of a closed portfolio of financial loans that is anticipated to remain outstanding for the designated hedged period. Adjustments will be made to record the swap at fair value as either an other asset or other liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in fair value recognized in net loans. The carrying value of the fair value swap on the Consolidated Balance Sheets will also be adjusted through loan interest income, based on changes in the fair value attributable to changes in the hedged risk.

The Company enters into interest rate swaps with certain qualifying commercial loan customers to meet their interest rate risk management needs. The Bank simultaneously enters into interest rate swaps with dealer counterparties, with identical notional amounts and offsetting terms. The net result of these interest rate swaps is that the customer pays a fixed rate of interest and the Company receives a floating rate. These back-to-back loan swaps are derivative financial instruments and are reported at fair value in other assets and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of loan swaps are recorded in other noninterest income and sum to zero because of the offsetting terms of the swaps with borrowers and the swaps with dealer counterparties.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Item 2.	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The purpose of this discussion is to focus on important factors affecting the Company s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 GENERAL 
 Eagle Financial Services, Inc. is a bank holding company which owns 100 of the stock of Bank of Clarke (the Bank and, collectively with Eagle Financial Services, Inc., the Company , we , us or our ). Accordingly, the results of operations for the Company are dependent upon the operations of the Bank. The Bank conducts a commercial banking business which consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds in commercial, consumer and real estate loans and municipal and U.S. government agency securities. The Bank s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the maximum extent permitted by law. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total assets of 1.88 billion, net loans of 1.47 billion, total deposits of 1.55 billion, and shareholders equity of 117.8 million. The Company s net income was 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 MANAGEMENT S STRATEGY 
 The Company strives to be an outstanding financial institution in its market by building solid sustainable relationships with: (1) its customers, by providing highly personalized customer service, a network of conveniently placed branches and ATMs, a competitive variety of products/services and courteous, professional employees, (2) its employees, by providing generous benefits, a positive work environment, advancement opportunities and incentives to exceed expectations, (3) its communities, by participating in local concerns, providing monetary support, supporting employee volunteerism and providing employment opportunities, and (4) its shareholders, by providing sound profits and returns, sustainable growth, regular dividends and committing to its local, independent status. 
 OPERATING STRATEGY 
 The Company is a locally owned and managed financial institution. This allows the Bank to be flexible and responsive in the products and services it offers. The Bank grows primarily by lending funds to local residents and businesses at a competitive price that reflects the inherent risk of lending. The Bank attempts to fund these loans through deposits gathered from local residents and businesses. The Bank prices its deposits by comparing alternative sources of funds and selecting the lowest cost available. When deposits are not adequate to fund asset growth, the Bank relies on borrowings, both short and long term. The Bank s primary source of borrowed funds is the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta which offers numerous terms and rate structures to the Bank. 
 As interest rates change, the Bank attempts to maintain its net interest margin by changing the price, terms, and mix of its financial assets and liabilities. The Bank also earns fees on services provided through its trust department, secondary market mortgage activities, BOLI, and deposit operations. The Bank also incurs noninterest expenses such as compensating employees, maintaining and acquiring fixed assets, and purchasing goods and services necessary to support its daily operations. 
 The Bank has a marketing department which seeks to develop new business. This is accomplished through an ongoing calling program whereby account officers visit with existing and potential customers to discuss the products and services offered. The Bank also utilizes traditional advertising such as television commercials, radio ads, newspaper ads, and billboards. 
 37 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 LENDING POLICIES 
 Administration and supervision over the lending process is provided by the Bank s Credit Administration Department. The principal risk associated with the Bank s loan portfolio is the creditworthiness of its borrowers. In an effort to manage this risk, the Bank s policy gives loan amount approval limits to individual loan officers based on their position and level of experience. Credit risk is increased or decreased, depending on the type of loan and prevailing economic conditions. In consideration of the different types of loans in the portfolio, the risk associated with real estate mortgage loans, commercial loans and consumer loans varies based on employment levels, consumer confidence, fluctuations in the value of real estate and other conditions that affect the ability of borrowers to repay debt. 
 The Company has written policies and procedures to help manage credit risk. The Company utilizes a loan review process that includes formulation of portfolio management strategy, guidelines for underwriting standards and risk assessment, procedures for ongoing identification and management of credit deterioration, and regular portfolio reviews to establish loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the Company s policies. 
 The Bank uses a tiered approach to approve credit requests consisting of individual lending authorities, joint approval of Co-Approval officers (Executive, Regional Credit Officer, Small Business Credit Officer), and a director loan committee. Lending limits for individuals are set by the Board of Directors and are determined by loan purpose, collateral type, and internal risk rating of the borrower. The highest individual authority (Executive) is assigned to the Bank s President/ Chief Executive Officer, Chief Banking Officer and Chief Credit Officer (approval authority only). Two Executive officers may combine their authority to approve loan requests to borrowers with credit exposure up to 10.0 million on a secured basis and 6.0 million unsecured. Three Executive officers may combine to approve loan requests to borrowers with credit exposure up to 15.0 million on a secured basis and 9.0 million unsecured. Consumer Central Lenders are individual lenders who have been assigned to an Approval Category (A through F) based upon their level of experience and job function. Consumer Central Lenders can co-approve consumer, home equity lines of credit and home equity loan requests up to their stated authorities. Officers in Categories A through F have lesser authorities and with approval of an Executive officer may extend loans to borrowers with exposure of 5.0 million on a secured basis and 3.0 million unsecured. Officers in Categories A through F can also utilize the co-approval of the Regional and Small Business Credit Officers to extend loans with exposures up to 2.5 million and 1.5 million respectively on a secured basis, and up to 1 million and 750 thousand respectively on an unsecured basis. Loans exceeding 15.0 million and up to the Bank s legal lending limit can be approved by the Risk Committee consisting of four directors (three directors constituting a quorum). The Director s Loan Committee also reviews and approves changes to the Bank s Loan Policy as presented by management. 
 The following sections discuss the major loan categories within the total loan portfolio: 
 One-to-Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending 
 Residential lending activity may be generated by the Bank s loan officer solicitations, referrals by real estate professionals, and existing or new bank customers. Loan applications are taken by a Bank loan officer. As part of the application process, information is gathered concerning income, employment and credit history of the applicant. The valuation of residential collateral is provided by independent fee appraisers who have been approved by the Bank s Directors Loan Committee. In connection with residential real estate loans, the Bank requires title insurance, hazard insurance and, if applicable, flood insurance. In addition to traditional residential mortgage loans secured by a first or junior lien on the property, the Bank offers home equity lines of credit. 
 38 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Commercial Real Estate Lending 
 Commercial real estate loans are secured by various types of commercial real estate in the Bank s market area, including multi-family residential buildings, commercial buildings and offices, small shopping centers and churches. Commercial real estate loan originations are obtained through broker referrals, direct solicitation of developers and continued business from customers. In its underwriting of commercial real estate, the Bank s loan to original appraised value ratio is generally 80 or less. Commercial real estate lending entails significant additional risk as compared with residential mortgage lending. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Additionally, the repayment of loans secured by income producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of a business or a real estate project and thus may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy, in general. The Bank s commercial real estate loan underwriting criteria require an examination of debt service coverage ratios, the borrower s creditworthiness, prior credit history and reputation, and the Bank typically requires personal guarantees or endorsements of the borrowers principal owners. 
 Construction and Land Development Lending 
 The Bank makes local construction loans, primarily residential, and land acquisition and development loans. The construction loans are secured by residential houses under construction and the underlying land for which the loan was obtained. The average life of most construction loans is less than one year and the Bank offers both fixed and variable rate interest structures. The interest rate structure offered to customers depends on the total amount of these loans outstanding and the impact of the interest rate structure on the Bank s overall interest rate risk. There are two characteristics of construction lending which impact its overall risk as compared to residential mortgage lending. First, there is more concentration risk due to the extension of a large loan balance through several lines of credit to a single developer or contractor. Second, there is more collateral risk due to the fact that loan funds are provided to the borrower based upon the estimated value of the collateral after completion. This could cause an inaccurate estimate of the amount needed to complete construction or an excessive loan-to-value ratio. To mitigate the risks associated with construction lending, the Bank generally limits loan amounts to 80 of the estimated appraised value of the finished construction project. The Bank also obtains a first lien on the property as security for its construction loans and typically requires personal guarantees from the borrower s principal owners. Finally, the Bank performs inspections of the construction projects to ensure that the percentage of construction completed correlates with the amount of draws on the construction line of credit. 
 Commercial and Industrial Lending 
 Commercial business loans generally have more risk than residential mortgage loans, but have higher yields. To manage these risks, the Bank generally obtains appropriate collateral and personal guarantees from the borrower s principal owners and monitors the financial condition of its business borrowers. Residential mortgage loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from employment and other income and are secured by real estate whose value tends to be readily ascertainable. In contrast, commercial business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from cash flow from its business and are secured by business assets, such as commercial real estate, accounts receivable, equipment and inventory. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans is substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Furthermore, the collateral for commercial business loans may depreciate over time and generally cannot be appraised with as much precision as residential real estate. 
 39 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Consumer Lending 
 The Bank offers various secured and unsecured consumer loans, which include personal installment loans, personal lines of credit, automobile loans, and credit card loans. The Bank originates its consumer loans within its geographic market area and these loans are generally made to customers with whom the Bank has an existing relationship. Consumer loans generally entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciable assets such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral on a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. 
 The underwriting standards employed by the Bank for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant s payment history on other debts and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and from any verifiable secondary income. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes an analysis of the value of the security in relation to the proposed loan amount. 
 
 Marine Lending 
 The Bank s marine loan portfolio is comprised of originated retail loans. In August 2023, the Company completed a sale of specific assets from its marine lending segment and reduced its workforce associated with the marine lending division, as it expects to cease accepting new marine lending business. As part of the sale, the Company sold its interest in marine vessel floor plan loans, its rights to service loans that had been sold to secondary market investors prior to the date of sale, and other assets that were not individually significant. Subsequent to the sale the Company retained ownership of its portfolio of marine vessel retail loans, which continue to constitute a significant portion of the Company's assets, revenues, and earnings. At present, the Company expects to hold the retained outstanding loans until they are ultimately repaid. Retail loans were generally limited to premium manufacturers with established relationships with the Company which have a vested interest in the secondary market pricing of their respective brand due to the limited inventory available for resale. Consequently, while not contractually committed, manufacturers will often support secondary resale values which can have the effect of reducing losses from non-performing retail marine loans. Retail borrowers generally have very high credit scores, substantial down payments, substantial net worth, personal liquidity, and excess cash flow.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 The financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The financial information contained within these statements is, to a significant extent, based on measurements of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of the transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact the transactions could change. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 The Company establishes the allowance for credit losses through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the estimated net realizable value or fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent, when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance represents management s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of loans held for investment, and is recorded at an amount that, in management s judgment, reduces the recorded investment in loans to the net amount expected to be collected. Management s judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of historical loan losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts relevant to the collectability of loans. The measurement of the allowance for credit losses is based in part on forecasts of unemployment, inflation, as well as the consumer price index, and may also consider other factors, which we believe to be indicative of risk factors related to collectability. Management also assesses the risk of credit losses arising from changes in economic conditions; the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; the volume and severity of delinquencies and adversely classified loan balances; lending policy and procedures; credit administration and lending staff; loan review; concentrations of credit and the value of underlying collateral in determining the recorded balance of the allowance for credit losses. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. In evaluating the level of the allowance, we consider a range of possible assumptions and outcomes related to the various factors identified above. Refer to the 2023 Form 10-K for additional detail concerning the determination of the allowance for credit losses on loans. 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 This report refers to certain financial measures that are computed under a basis other than GAAP ("non-GAAP"). The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including tax-equivalent net interest income and efficiency ratio, to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance and to enhance investors' overall understanding of such financial performance. The methodology for determining these non-GAAP measures may differ among companies. Non-GAAP measures are supplemental and not a substitute for, or more important than, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Net Income 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.2 million, an increase of 31.53 , or 2.2 million, when compared to the same period in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 3.4 million, an increase of 1.1 million, or 47.65 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per share, basic and diluted, were 2.58 and 1.98 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Earnings per share, basic and diluted, were 0.97 and 0.66 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Return on average assets ("ROA") measures how efficiently the Company uses its assets to produce net income. Some issues reflected within this efficiency include the Company s asset mix, funding sources, pricing, fee generation, and cost control. The ROA of the Company, on an annualized basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.69 and 0.54 , respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company's annualized ROA was 0.75 and 0.51 , respectively. 
 Return on average equity ("ROE") measures the utilization of shareholders equity in generating net income. This measurement is affected by the same factors as ROA with consideration to how much of the Company s assets are funded by shareholders. The ROE of the Company, on an annualized basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 11.16 and 8.96 , respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company's annualized ROE was 11.99 and 8.87 , respectively. 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is our primary source of revenue, representing the difference between interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is impacted primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as changes in interest rates. Net interest income was 37.7 million and 38.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which represents a decrease of 249 thousand, or 0.66 . Net interest income was 13.2 million and 12.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which represents an increase of 250 thousand, or 1.94 . The increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities has continued to outpace the increase in the average rate earned on interest-earning assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased from the 2023 period primarily due to a 70 basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits reflecting efforts to retain and attract account balances by offering promotional rates. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 37 basis points compared to the average rate paid for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and the average balance of interest-bearing deposits grew by 61.8 million. 
 The Company's net interest spread and net interest margin decreased 31 basis points and 19 basis points, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's net interest spread and net interest margin decreased 13 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively, compared to the same period in 2023.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Total interest and dividend income was 67.3 million and 61.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which represents an increase of 6.2 million, or 10.21 . Total interest and dividend income was 23.7 million and 22.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which represents an increase of 1.5 million, or 6.78 . The increase in interest income was driven by an increase in the average balance of the loan portfolio along with the rise in interest rates. Average interest-earning assets increased 96.7 million, or 5.80 , when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while the average yield on earning-assets increased by 20 basis points over the same period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to the higher yields earned as the average balances were level with the prior year period. 
 Total interest expense was 29.6 million and 23.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which represents an increase of 6.5 million, or 28.07 . Total interest expense was 10.5 million and 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which represents an increase of 1.2 million, or 13.52 . The interest rate environment, coupled with the growth of higher-paying deposit accounts, have been the main drivers for the increase in interest expense during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense on deposit accounts increased 7.4 million, or 46.24 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of which 5.3 million was attributable to time deposits. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the average balance of interest-bearing deposits was 1.07 billion and 961.1 million, respectively. The 7.4 million increase in deposit interest expense was slightly offset by a decrease in interest expense on FHLB advances. The average balance of FHLB advances was 146.6 million and 168.2 million with an average rate of 4.72 and 4.77 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to time deposits, while FHLB borrowings experienced a decrease in expense reflecting a lower level of utilization during the three month period ending September 30, 2024. 
 The net interest margin was 2.86 and 3.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2.88 and 2.93 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net interest margin is calculated on a tax-equivalent basis. Tax-equivalent net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit on certain securities and loans, whose interest is tax-exempt, to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense. The tax rate used to calculate the tax benefit was 21 for 2024 and 2023. 
 Net interest margin has primarily declined due to deposit pricing pressure as interest rates increased throughout 2023 and and as competition for new deposits continues. If these factors persist, net interest margin may experience further downward pressure and may also result in the Company having to borrow additional wholesale funding to fund asset growth, which is more expensive than deposits.

(1) Tax benefit was calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 . 

The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 5.10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.90 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 20 basis points during the current year period. The tax-equivalent yield on securities increased 19 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The tax equivalent yield on loans increased 30 basis points from 5.27 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.57 for the same time period in 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 5.17 and 5.02 , respectively, an increase of 15 basis points in the current year period. The tax-equivalent yields on securities and loans also increased during the three month period in 2024 compared to 2023 by 5 basis points and 27 basis points, respectively. 
 The increase in the tax-equivalent yield on earning assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted mostly from the increase in the tax-equivalent yield on loans. The increase in the yield on loans as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 was primarily due to the sustained elevated interest rate environment, 
 The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased 51 basis points to 3.17 from 2.66 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period, and increased 29 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average rate on interest-bearing deposits increased 37 basis points and 70 basis points during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same 2023 periods, driven by increases in time deposits. The interest rate environment, marketplace competition and growth of higher-cost deposit accounts have been the main drivers for the increases in the average rate and total expense paid on interest-bearing deposits.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses is based upon management s estimate of the amount required to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. The Company's calculation of the provision for credit losses consists of changes in the allowance for credit losses on loans and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. The allowance for credit losses on loans represents management s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of loans held for investment, and is recorded at an amount that, in management s judgment, reduces the recorded investment in loans to the net amount expected to be collected. Management s judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of historical loan losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts relevant to the collectability of loans. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The amount of provision for credit losses on loans is affected by several factors including the growth rate of loans, net charge-offs (recoveries), and the estimated amount of expected losses within the loan portfolio. 
 The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.2 million and 1.3 million, respectively. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1.5 million and 216 thousand, respectively. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted largely from a 2.0 million provision against the marine portfolio due to charge-offs of 1.5 million, a specific reserve on an individually evaluated relationship of 268 thousand, and growth in the portfolio balance as compared to the prior measurement period. Marine loan charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect a clean-up within the portfolio and not a systemic performance issue. 
 Noninterest Income 
 Total noninterest income was 5.3 million and 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 13.0 million and 11.1 million, respectively. Management reviews the activities which generate noninterest income on an ongoing basis. The following table provides the components of noninterest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which are included within the respective Consolidated Statements of Income headings. Variances that the Company believes require explanation are discussed below the table.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Wealth management fee income increased from 2023 to 2024. Wealth management fee income is comprised of income from fiduciary activities as well as commissions from the sale of non-deposit investment products. The amount of income from fiduciary activities is determined by the number of active accounts and total assets under management. Higher interest rates and more favorable conditions in the stock market have resulted in an expansion of total assets under management. One-time fees for estates and other services have also contributed to the year over year increase in revenue. Investment sales have also increased as favorable market activity has made the use of brokerage and advisory investments more attractive. 
 Gain on the sale of marine finance assets was 463 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as the result of the Company's sale of certain marine finance division assets on August 23, 2023. Refer to additional discussion under the heading "Marine Lending" in Item 2 and Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Gain on sale of loans increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The Company sold 40.4 million in mortgage loans on the secondary market and 6.9 million SBA commercial loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This compares to loan sales consisting of 21.1 million in mortgage loans, 3.1 million in SBA commercial loans, and 49.1 million of marine loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Loan sales resulted in gains of 1.3 million and 913 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gain on loan sales recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 627 thousand and 265 thousand, respectively, and resulted from mortgage loan sales of 14.9 million and 4.2 million in SBA commercial loans during the third quarter of 2024 compared to mortgage loan sales of 15.9 million, marine loan sales of 10.5 million, and SBA commercial loans sales of 275 thousand during the third quarter of 2023. 
 Bank owned life insurance ("BOLI") fee income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023 as a result of an investment of 5 million into BOLI by the Company during the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received BOLI settlements resulting in gains of 653 thousand and 907 thousand, respectively. 
 Income from holdings in small business investment companies increased 345 thousand and 532 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively when compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases during the current year periods can be mainly attributed to higher cash distributions received, based on the results of their performance. 
 Other operating income decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to loan swap fee income. No loan swap fee income has been recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 225 thousand and 229 thousand recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the 2023 period, loan swap transactions executed with borrowers reflected original notional balances of 18.6 million.

NM - Not Meaningful 
 On August 23, 2023, the Company completed a sale of specific assets from its marine lending segment. As part of the sale, the Company sold its interest in marine vessel floor plan loans totaling 52.8 million, its rights to service loans that had been sold to secondary market investors prior to the date of sale (valued at 595 thousand on balance sheet prior to sale), and other assets that were not individually significant. The Company received total consideration, net of selling expenses, of 53.5 million and recognized a gain of 435 thousand. The assets sold as well as their related revenues and contribution to earnings did not constitute a significant portion of the Company's assets or operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023. As part of the sale, the Company reduced its workforce associated with the marine lending division, and ceased accepting new marine lending business. Subsequent to the sale of these assets, the Company retained ownership of approximately 260.5 million of marine vessel retail loans which continue to constitute a significant portion of the Company's assets, revenues, and earnings. At present, the Company expects to hold the retained outstanding loans until they are ultimately repaid. Subsequent to the sale, non-interest expenses related to marine lending have been significantly reduced or eliminated as discussed in variance explanation paragraphs below.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Salaries and employee benefits decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 over 2023, largely reflecting decreases in salaries and stock based compensation expenses while experiencing increases in employee benefits and annual incentive plan expenses. The Company's number of full-time equivalent employees ("FTE's") has decreased from 245 at September 30, 2023 to 233 at September 30, 2024. In addition to normal staffing fluctuation, the decrease in the number of FTE's was due to the sale of the marine finance assets during the third quarter of 2023. The Company reduced its workforce associated with the marine lending division and ceased accepting new marine lending business. Stock based compensation expense decreased due to a higher level of share forfeitures recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Mostly offsetting these decreases were annual pay increases, an increase in the annual incentive accrual, increasing insurance costs and enhanced employee benefit plans. 
 Equipment expenses have increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. A new loan origination system implemented during the fourth quarter of 2023 was a significant driver of the year-over-year increase. 
 Advertising and marketing expenses and computer software expenses decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease during nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the discontinuation of new marine lending business subsequent to August 2023, including costs for business development, as well as corporate rebranding expenses incurred during the 2023 periods. 
 A repossessed marine vessel was sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in the recognition of a 204 thousand loss. There were no sales of repossessed assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 FDIC assessment expense, which is based in part on asset size and capital levels, decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 over 2023. The decrease in FDIC assessment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects an improvement in the financial ratios portion of the assessment rate, largely due to the decline in the one-year asset growth factor. The assessment rate also includes a two basis point charge by the FDIC, which was applied to all financial institutions beginning in June 2023. 
 Professional fees decreased between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the same periods in 2023. During the 2023 period there were legal expenses for the marine lending business, legal costs related to the ESOP termination, and strategic planning expenses that were not incurred during the 2024 periods. 
 Data processing fee expenses increased during three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the same period in 2023, reflecting increased costs for core systems, including fees that are volume based. 
 Other operating expenses decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The largest driver of the decrease was due to the workforce reduction described above, which included a change in control agreement and sales and travel expenses. Additional year-over-year decreases reflect the Company's focus on expense control measures, as well as the impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-02 to account for its investments in low-income residential rental properties under the proportional amortization method effective January 1, 2024. Upon adoption of this accounting method, amortization expense is no longer recorded in other operating expenses, rather as an adjustment to income tax expense. These decreases were partially offset by increases in loan and collections expenses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 The efficiency ratio of the Company was 71.34 and 84.71 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The efficiency ratio of the Company was 75.22 and 81.08 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The improvement in the efficiency ratio during 2024 reflects an increase in noninterest income, coupled with lower noninterest expenses. Noninterest expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included one-time expenses of 1.0 million related to the sale of the marine finance assets during the third quarter of 2023. Excluding these expenses, the efficiency ratio for three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 would have been 78.71 and 79.02 , respectively. The efficiency ratio is not a measurement under GAAP. It is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and noninterest income. The Company adjusts for non-recurring items such as gains and losses on the investment portfolio and other gains/losses from OREO, repossessed assets, disposals of bank premises and equipment, etc. The tax rate utilized is 21 . The Company calculates and reviews this ratio as a means of evaluating operational efficiency. 
 The calculation of the efficiency ratio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense was 550 thousand and 457 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 1.6 million and 1.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate was 13.84 and 16.46 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate was 15.11 and 16.49 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate is below the statutory rate of 21 due to tax-exempt income on investment securities and loans, BOLI, income tax credits on qualified affordable housing project investments, and qualified rehabilitation credits. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, BOLI included income from life insurance proceeds of 653 thousand and 907 thousand, respectively. There was no income from life insurance proceeds in the comparative three and nine month periods. Qualified affordable housing project investments are discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Securities 
 Total securities available for sale were 130.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 137.4 million at December 31, 2023. This represents a decrease of 7.3 million, or 5.38 . The Company purchased no securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company had total maturities, calls, and principal repayments of 11.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional details about the Company s securities portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company had a net unrealized loss on available for sale securities of 18.3 million at September 30, 2024 as compared to a net unrealized loss of 22.8 million at December 31, 2023. Unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities are reported within shareholders equity, net of the related deferred tax effect, as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The primary cause of the unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was changes in market interest rates and other market conditions and not credit concerns of the issuers. Since the losses can be primarily attributed to changes in market interest rates and conditions and not expected cash flows or an issuer s financial condition and management does not intend to sell and it is likely that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, the Company concluded a credit loss did not exist. 
 Loan Portfolio 
 The Company s primary use of funds is supporting lending activities from which it derives the greatest amount of interest income. Gross loans were 1.48 billion and 1.46 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This represents an increase of 20.6 million, or 1.41 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The ratio of gross loans to deposits decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 97.10 at December 31, 2023 to 95.95 at September 30, 2024. 
 The loan portfolio consists primarily of loans for owner-occupied single-family dwellings and loans secured by commercial real estate. Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides the composition of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, through the normal course of business, 47.3 million in loans were sold, consisting primarily of mortgage loans. These loan sales resulted in net gains of 1.3 million. The balance of gross loans experienced solid growth, primarily in loans secured by real estate, which more than offset decreases in the marine and consumer loan portfolios due to paydowns and a large consumer loan payoff during 2024. 
 Residential real estate loans, consisting of first liens, junior liens and home equity loans, were 367.3 million, or 24.76 , and 356.1 million, or 24.35 , of total loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase of 11.2 million, or 3.14 , is primarily due to originations of residential adjustable-rate jumbo loans held in portfolio. 
 Commercial real estate loans (including multifamily loans) were 630.6 million, or 42.51 , and 600.3 million, or 41.04 , of total loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing an increase of 30.3 million, or 5.04 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Owner occupied commercial real estate loans experienced a 21.8 million increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and non-owner occupied and multifamily commercial real estate loans increased 8.5 million during the same period. 
 Construction and secured by farmland loans totaled 97.2 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 84.1 million at December 31, 2023. This increase of 13.1 million, or 15.48 , primarily reflects a 17.2 million construction loan in the current quarter with an existing commercial borrower. 
 Marine loans were 225.9 million, or 15.23 , and 251.2 million, or 17.17 , of total loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of 25.3 million, or 10.06 . The decline in marine loans reflects paydowns, payoffs and charge-offs only and no new originations. On August 23, 2023, the Company completed a sale of specific assets from its marine lending segment. As part of the sale, the Company sold its interest in marine vessel floor plan loans totaling

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 52.8 million and reduced its workforce associated with the marine lending division as it expects to cease accepting new marine lending business. At present, the Company expects to hold the retained outstanding loans until they are ultimately repaid. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 The purpose of, and the methods for, measuring the allowance for credit losses on loans are discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section in the 2023 Form 10-K. Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements shows the activity within the allowance for credit losses on loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023. Charged-off loans were 2.3 million and 314 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the total charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1.5 million, or 64.50 , were marine loans reflecting clean-up within the portfolio and not a systemic performance issue. Recoveries were 754 thousand and 255 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This resulted in net charge-offs (recoveries) of 1.5 million and 59 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The annualized ratio of net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans was 0.42 and 0.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of loans was 1.03 at September 30, 2024 and 0.99 at December 31, 2023. The increase as compared to December 31, 2023 was mainly attributable to net loan charge-offs and a specific reserve on a collateral-dependent commercial business loan relationship. 
 Management believes that the allowance for credit losses on loans is currently adequate to absorb the current expected losses in the loan portfolio. 
 Credit Risk, Nonperforming Assets and Other Assets 
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually to classify the loans as to credit risk on a quarterly basis. Loans risk rated as special mention, which exhibit negative trends and potential weaknesses, totaled 73.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 33.5 million at December 31, 2023. Loans risk rated as classified, include substandard, doubtful, and loss loans, totaled 3.0 million and 8.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. All other loans were classified as pass, exhibiting acceptable history of profits, cash flow ability and liquidity. The increase in special mention loans of 39.9 million was primarily in the owner-occupied commercial real estate portfolio as loans were downgraded from pass as the result of not having current financial statement information available at their annual review. Upon receipt of current financial information, the loans will be evaluated and returned to a pass classification if appropriate. 
 Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, repossessed assets, OREO (foreclosed properties), and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing as detailed in the table below.

Nonperforming assets decreased by 3.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Nonaccrual loans were 2.3 million and 5.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There was 99 thousand in OREO and repossessed assets at September 30, 2024 and 304 thousand at December 31, 2023. There were 251 thousand in loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing at September 30, 2024 and 181 thousand in loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing at December 31, 2023. The percentage of nonperforming assets to loans, OREO and repossessed assets was 0.18 at September 30, 2024 and 0.42 at December 31, 2023. 
 Total past due loans, as disclosed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, increased to 8.2 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 2.3 million at December 31, 2023. The 5.9 million increase in past due loans was primarily due to one relationship, consisting of two real estate secured loans totaling 6.8 million, for which the loans have matured and a 90-day extension has been approved. Total past due loans as of September 30, 2024 consist of loans secured by real estate totaling 7.7 million, and consumer and commercial business loans totaling 513 thousand. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, nonaccrual loans decreased by 3.3 million and totaled 2.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 5.6 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease primarily reflects 4.2 million in payoffs of two commercial real estate loans and three residential investor real estate loans and loan charge-offs totaling 651 thousand. These decreases were partially offset by two commercial business loan relationships totaling 937 thousand and a 748 thousand owner-occupied commercial real estate loan added to nonaccrual loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Management evaluates the financial condition of borrowers and the value of any collateral on nonaccrual loans. The results of these evaluations are used to estimate the amount of losses which may be realized on the disposition of these nonaccrual loans and are reflected in the allowance for credit losses on loans. At September 30, 2024 there was a 268 thousand allowance for credit losses required on the commercial business loan relationship due to a potential deficiency in collateral value. There was no allowance for credit losses required on nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2023. 
 Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when collection of principal and interest is doubtful, generally when a loan becomes 90 days past due. There are three negative implications for earnings when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. First, all interest accrued but unpaid at the date that the loan is placed on non-accrual status is either deducted from interest income or written off as a loss. Second, accruals of interest are discontinued until it becomes certain that both principal and interest can be repaid. Finally, there may be actual losses to principal that require additional provisions for credit losses to be charged against earnings. 
 55 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 For real estate loans, upon foreclosure, the balance of the loan is transferred to OREO and carried at the fair value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends, less estimated selling costs. If a write down of the OREO property is necessary at the time of foreclosure, the amount is charged-off to the allowance for credit losses. A review of the recorded property value is performed in conjunction with normal quarterly reviews, and if market conditions indicate that the recorded value exceeds the fair value, additional write downs of the property value are charged directly to operations. 
 Deposits 
 Total deposits were 1.55 billion and 1.51 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This represents an increase of 39.6 million or 2.63 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides the composition of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The total increase in deposits was in both core accounts, which increased 15.9 million and non-core accounts, which increased 23.7 million. During the first three quarters of 2024, noninterest demand deposits experienced a decline of 23.0 million, while savings and interest bearing demand deposits declined 838 thousand. Total time deposits increased 63.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting increases of 33.9 million and 29.6 million for time deposits with balances less than 250,000 and time deposits with balances 250,000 and more, respectively. Marketing efforts, including rate specials, have been utilized to maintain maturing accounts and to acquire new time deposit accounts. Core deposits, consisting of checking accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts and time deposits less than 250,000, totaled 1.29 billion, or 83.53 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.28 billion, or 84.67 , of total deposits at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, over 75 of deposits were fully FDIC insured. 
 CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The Bank continues to be a well capitalized financial institution. Total shareholders equity at September 30, 2024 was 117.8 million, reflecting a percentage of total assets of 6.26 , as compared to 108.4 million and 5.94 at December 31, 2023. The 9.4 million increase in shareholders equity was primarily due to net income of 9.2 million earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a decrease in unrealized losses on the securities available for sale portfolio of 4.5 million or 3.6 million, net of tax. These increases in shareholders' equity were partially offset by dividends declared of 3.2 million. During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company declared dividends of 0.90. The Company has a Dividend Investment Plan that allows shareholders to reinvest dividends in Company stock. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements and had regulatory capital ratios in excess of the levels established for well-capitalized institutions. The Bank monitors these ratios on a quarterly basis and has several strategies, including without limitation the issuance of common stock, to ensure that these ratios remain above regulatory minimums. The Bank's capital amounts and ratios are presented using the Federal Reserve's risk-based capital framework. 
 56 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Effective January 1, 2015, the Federal Reserve issued final risk-based capital rules to align with the Basel III regulatory capital framework and meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules require the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 of risk-weighted assets; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0 of risk-weighted assets; and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0 of total assets. In addition, a capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5 was effective January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with any ratio (excluding the leverage ratio) above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The capital conservation buffer rule requires the Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , plus a 2.5 capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 4.5 common equity Tier 1 ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0 ), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 , plus the 2.5 capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0 Tier 1 capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 ), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 , plus the 2.5 capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0 total capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5 ), and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 , calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank's capital ratios were as follows: Common equity Tier 1 capital was 10.57 and 10.27 , respectively, Tier 1 risk-based capital was 10.57 and 10.27 , respectively, Total risk-based capital was 11.53 and 11.16 , respectively, and Tier 1 leverage was 8.70 and 8.48 , respectively. 
 Pursuant to the Federal Reserve s Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement, qualifying bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than 3 billion, such as the Company, are not subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements . 
 On March 31, 2022, the Company entered into Subordinated Note Purchase Agreements with certain purchasers pursuant to which the Company issued and sold 30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.50 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due April 1, 2032. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q, for discussion of subordinated debt. 
 
 LIQUIDITY 
 Liquidity management involves meeting the present and future financial obligations of the Company with the sale or maturity of assets or with the occurrence of additional liabilities. Liquidity needs are met with cash on hand, deposits in banks, federal funds sold, unpledged securities classified as available for sale and loans maturing within one year. At September 30, 2024, liquid assets totaled 310.7 million as compared to 367.7 million at December 31, 2023. These amounts represented 17.61 and 21.41 of total liabilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company pledged available for sale mortgage-backed securities totaling 110.2 million with the Federal Reserve Bank discount window, which reduced its liquid assets and reinforced its ability to obtain liquidity from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. The Company generally attempts to minimize liquidity demand by primarily utilizing core deposits to fund asset growth. Securities provide a constant source of liquidity through paydowns and maturities. Also, the Company maintains short-term borrowing arrangements, namely federal funds lines of credit, with larger financial institutions as an additional source of liquidity. The Bank s membership with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta provides a source of borrowings with numerous rate and term structures. The Company s senior management monitors the liquidity position regularly and attempts to maintain a position which utilizes available funds most efficiently.
