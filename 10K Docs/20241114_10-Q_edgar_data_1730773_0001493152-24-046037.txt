and the issuance of shares of common stock of the Company with a fair value of . Such shares
were subject to a leak-out agreement pursuant to which Gault Seafood could not sell or otherwise transfer the shares until February 3,
2023. 

On
February 1, 2024, the Company entered into a ninety-day Master Services Agreement (the Services Agreement with Afritex
Ventures, Inc. a Texas corporation Afritex ), pursuant to which the Company will be responsible for all of Afritex s
operations and finance functions. The Company will provide Afritex with working capital in order to sustain operations and will purchase
certain inventory listed in the Services Agreement. In consideration for its services, during the term of the Services Agreement, the
Company will earn all of the revenue and profits by the purchase and sale of Afritex s inventory. Under the Services Agreement,
Afritex may not sell or otherwise use as consideration any of its intellectual property without the Company s consent. The Company
must maintain certain commercial liability insurance during the term of the Services Agreement. The Services Agreement also provides
that the Company may not solicit Afritex employees for 24 months nor circumvent existing business relationships of Afritex for three
years, after the term of the Services Agreement. The Company automatically extended the Services Agreement to August 31, 2024 after which it expired. 

In
connection with the Services Agreement, on February 12, 2024, the Company entered into an Intangibles Assets and Machinery Option To
Purchase Agreement with Afritex (the Option Agreement ). Pursuant to the Option Agreement, the Company has the option to
purchase Afritex s intangible assets, machinery and equipment set forth in the Option Agreement for a purchase price of 
for machinery and equipment and shares of the Company s common stock were issued on February 12, 2024 to be held in escrow,
for intangible assets. In addition, for one year from the date of the Option Agreement, Afritex has an option to purchase up to 
shares of the Company s common stock at a discount to the lowest volume-weighted average price in the immediately prior five
days. The sale of any shares acquired by Afritex under the Option Agreement are subject to a leak-out provision as set
forth in the Option Agreement. 

In
connection with the Services Agreement, on February 1, 2024, AFVFL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was incorporated in
the State of Florida for the purpose of purchasing raw materials from Afritex, up to the date of the Service Agreement expiration,
for the preparation of packaged seafood and other inventory to be sold to various customers in the United States. As of
August 31, 2024, the Service Agreement expired. 

On
May 20, 2024, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to affect a Reverse Stock
Split ), which became effective the same day. All share and per share amounts have been restated for all periods presented to reflect
the Reverse Stock Split. 

.
No new purchases have been made from Bacolod since November 2020. There was cost of revenue related to inventories purchased from
Bacolod recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

The
Company elected an accounting policy to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities. Consideration payable to a
customer is recorded as a reduction of the arrangement s transaction price, thereby reducing the amount of revenue recognized,
unless the payment is for distinct goods or services received from the customer.

and six to for real property. The Company elected the accounting policy to include both the lease and non-lease components
of its agreements as a single component and accounts for them as a lease. 

Lease
liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings
available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives,
plus any direct costs from executing the lease. Lease assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets used in
operations. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term. 

When
we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset,
and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider these options in determining the classification and measurement
of the lease. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the
term of the lease.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
as of September 30, 2024, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e)
and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer have concluded that based on the material weaknesses discussed below our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted
under the Securities Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms and that our disclosure controls are not effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

31 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: 

inadequate control over the monitoring of inventory maintained in the Company s third-party warehouse; 

ineffective controls over the Company s financial close and reporting process; and 

inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives, including lack of personnel resources and technical accounting expertise
within the accounting function of the Company. 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses that were identified did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes
that these weaknesses, if not properly remediated, could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we plan to further
initiate, the following measures, subject to the availability of required resources: 

We plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and hire personnel resources with technical accounting
expertise within the accounting function; and 

We plan to create an internal control framework that will address financial close and reporting process, among other procedures. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the period covered by this Quarterly Report, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
