Hess Guyana Exploration Limited (HGEL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hess, is currently in arbitration relating to the applicability of a right of first refusal (the Stabroek ROFR) contained in the operating agreement (the Stabroek JOA) among HGEL and affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon Mobil) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). The arbitration merits hearing about the applicability of the Stabroek ROFR to the Merger has been scheduled for May 2025, with a decision expected in the following three months.

 Additions to capitalized exploratory well costs pending the determination of proved reserves Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves ) Capitalized exploratory well costs charged to expense ) Balance at September 30, 2024 
 In the first nine months, additions to capitalized exploratory well costs pending determination of proved reserves primarily related to wells drilled on the Stabroek Block (Hess ), offshore Guyana. Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves resulted from the sanction of the Whiptail development project, the sixth sanctioned project on the Stabroek Block. At September 30, 2024, exploration and appraisal wells on the Stabroek Block, with a total cost of million, were capitalized pending determination of proved reserves. Capitalized exploratory well costs charged to expense in the first nine months primarily relate to exploration wells in the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) (Hess in the Gulf of Thailand. In the second quarter of 2024, the regulator provided notification that the current production sharing contract (PSC) for JDA Block A-18 will not be re-awarded to the existing PSC contractors upon its expiration in 2029. There is no plan to develop these discoveries prior to the expiration of the existing PSC. The preceding table excludes well costs of million that were incurred and expensed during the first nine months of 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, exploratory well costs capitalized for greater than one year following completion of drilling of million was comprised of the following: 
 Guyana: of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relate to successful exploration and appraisal wells where hydrocarbons were encountered on the Stabroek Block. The operator plans further appraisal drilling on the block and is conducting pre-development planning for additional phases of development. 
 Suriname: of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relate to the Zanderij-1 well on Block 42 (Hess ). Exploration and appraisal activities are ongoing. 
 Malaysia: of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relate to the North Malay Basin (Hess ), offshore Peninsular Malaysia, where hydrocarbons were encountered in successful exploration wells. Pre-development studies are ongoing. 
 
 million (December 31, 2023: million) that are on a non-recourse basis to Hess Corporation, while Hess Midstream LP assets available to settle the obligations of Hess Midstream LP included cash and cash equivalents totaling million (December 31, 2023: million), property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of million (December 31, 2023: million) and an equity-method investment in the Little Missouri 4 (LM4) gas processing plant with a carrying value of million (December 31, 2023: million). At September 30, 2024, we have an approximate consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP on an as-exchanged basis, primarily through our ownership of Class B units in Hess Midstream Operations LP (HESM Opco), the operating subsidiary of Hess Midstream LP, which are exchangeable into Class A shares of Hess Midstream LP on a one-for-one basis. 
 LM4 is a million standard cubic feet per day gas processing plant located south of the Missouri River in McKenzie County, North Dakota, that was constructed as part of a / joint venture between Hess Midstream LP and Targa Resources Corp. Hess Midstream LP has a natural gas processing agreement with LM4 under which it pays a processing fee and reimburses LM4 for its proportionate share of electricity costs. The processing fees included in Operating costs and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were million and million, respectively, compared with million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, Hess Midstream LP completed underwritten public equity offerings of an aggregate of million Hess Midstream LP Class A shares held by an affiliate of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). Hess Corporation did not receive any proceeds from these public equity offerings. As these transactions did not result in a change in Hess Corporation s ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP on a consolidated basis, there was no adjustment to Noncontrolling interests resulting from

 million resulting from step-ups in the tax basis of Hess Midstream LP s investment in HESM Opco. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, HESM Opco repurchased an aggregate of approximately million HESM Opco Class B units held by affiliates of Hess Corporation and GIP for total proceeds of million. The repurchases were financed using borrowings under HESM Opco s revolving credit facility and cash on hand. As Hess Corporation participated in these repurchases only to the extent necessary to maintain its current ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP on a consolidated basis, there was no adjustment to Noncontrolling interests resulting from changes to ownership interests. However, the repurchases, in aggregate, resulted in an increase in deferred tax assets and Noncontrolling interests of million due to adjustments in the carrying value of Hess Midstream LP s investment in HESM Opco without corresponding adjustments in the tax basis. The aggregate proceeds paid to GIP of million reduced Noncontrolling interests . 
 During the first nine months of 2023, Hess Midstream LP completed underwritten public equity offerings of an aggregate of million Hess Midstream LP Class A shares. Hess Corporation received net proceeds of million from the first public offering in May 2023, but did not participate or receive any proceeds from the second public offering in August 2023. The transactions, in aggregate, resulted in an increase in Capital in excess of par and Noncontrolling interests of million and million, respectively. The increase to Noncontrolling interests of million is comprised of million resulting from changes to ownership interests due to the first public offering in May 2023, and million from an increase to deferred tax assets resulting from step-ups in the tax basis of Hess Midstream LP s investment in HESM Opco. 
 During the first nine months of 2023, HESM Opco repurchased an aggregate of approximately million HESM Opco Class B units held by affiliates of Hess Corporation and GIP for total proceeds of million. The repurchases were financed using borrowings under HESM Opco s revolving credit facility. The repurchases, in aggregate, resulted in an increase in Capital in excess of par and a decrease in Noncontrolling interests of million due to changes in ownership interests, and an increase in deferred tax assets and Noncontrolling interests of million due to adjustments in the carrying value of Hess Midstream LP s investment in HESM Opco without corresponding adjustments in the tax basis. The aggregate proceeds paid to GIP of million reduced Noncontrolling interests .

At the time of issuance, the proceeds were primarily used to reduce indebtedness outstanding under HESM Opco s revolving credit facility. The indenture for the fixed-rate senior unsecured notes contains covenants that are substantially similar to the covenants contained in the indentures for the other existing HESM Opco fixed-rate senior unsecured notes. 
 In July 2024, we repaid the outstanding million principal amount of our fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, which matured on July 15, 2024.

Significant inputs used in determining future net cash flows include future prices, estimated expenditures to remedy the mechanical issue, and projected production volumes using risk adjusted oil and gas reserves. Future pricing assumptions were based on forward strip crude oil prices as of September 30, 2024 to the end of field life. Estimated expenditures to remedy the mechanical issue reflect the use of a deepwater drilling rig, and the nature and scope of the work required to return the well to production. A pre-tax charge of million million after income taxes) was also recorded in the third quarter of 2024 resulting from revisions to our estimated abandonment liabilities for uneconomic properties, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico.

 million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. We have complied with the EPA s March 2014 Administrative Order and contributed funding for the Remedial Design based on an allocation of costs among the parties determined by a third-party expert. In January 2020, we received an additional Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and several other parties to begin Remedial Action along the uppermost portion of the Canal. We intend to comply with this Administrative Order. The remediation work began in the fourth quarter of 2020. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us, and the costs will continue to be allocated amongst the parties, as they were for the Remedial Design. 
 From time to time, we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. We periodically receive notices from the EPA that we are a potential responsible party under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable. For any site for which we have received such a notice, the EPA s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed, or the EPA s claims have been settled or a settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. Beginning in 2017, certain states, municipalities and private associations in California, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and South Carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil, gas and coal producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. These proceedings include claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief. Beginning in 2013, various parishes in Louisiana filed suit against approximately 100 oil and gas companies, including us, alleging that the companies operations and activities in certain fields violated the State and Local Coastal Resource Management Act of 1978, as amended, and caused contamination, subsidence and other environmental damages to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, the payment of the costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate and otherwise restore the allegedly impacted areas. The ultimate impact of such climate and other aforementioned environmental proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates. 
 We are also involved in claims in federal and state courts in North Dakota related to post-production deductions from royalty and working interest payments. The plaintiffs in these cases assert that we take unauthorized or excessive post-production deductions from royalty or working interest payments for various oil and gas processing and transportation related costs and expenses. These plaintiffs seek reimbursement for allegedly underpaid revenue. It is our position that these costs and expenses are actual, reasonable, necessary, and authorized by the respective leases and North Dakota law. We believe that based on the facts and circumstances of these claims and because we have viable defenses, loss is not probable and the ultimate impact of these claims on our business or accounts cannot be estimated at this time due to the early stages of the proceedings and the speculative and indeterminate damages. 
 We may also be exposed to future decommissioning liabilities for divested assets in the event the current or future owners of facilities previously owned by us are determined to be unable to perform such actions, whether due to bankruptcy or otherwise. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. 
 Subject to the foregoing, in management s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including the matters disclosed above, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements, or revise our opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.

 Overview 
 Hess Corporation is a global E P company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located in the United States (U.S.), Guyana, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) and Malaysia. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname. At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30 ), offshore Guyana, we and our partners have discovered a significant resource base and are executing a multi-phased development of the block. We currently have three floating production, storage and offloading vessels (FPSO) producing, and plan to have six FPSOs with an aggregate expected production capacity of approximately 1.3 million gross barrels of oil per day (bopd) producing by the end of 2027. The discovered resources to date on the block are expected to underpin the potential for up to ten FPSOs. 
 Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation s approximate 38 consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at September 30, 2024, provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating natural gas liquids (NGL); gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. 
 On October 22, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Chevron Corporation (Chevron) and Yankee Merger Sub Inc. (Merger Subsidiary), a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron. The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Hess, and Hess will be the surviving corporation in the Merger as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron (such transaction, the Merger). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, our stockholders will receive at the effective time of the Merger consideration consisting of 1.025 shares of Chevron common stock for each share of our common stock. On May 28, 2024, holders of a majority of Hess outstanding common stock voted to approve the Merger. Hess Guyana Exploration Limited (HGEL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hess, is currently in arbitration relating to the applicability of a right of first refusal (the Stabroek ROFR) contained in the operating agreement (the Stabroek JOA) among HGEL and affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon Mobil) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). The arbitration merits hearing about the applicability of the Stabroek ROFR to the Merger has been scheduled for May 2025, with a decision expected in the following three months. We cannot predict the date on which the Merger will be completed because it is subject to conditions beyond our control, including the outcome of the arbitration. 
 Third Quarter Results 
 In the third quarter of 2024, net income was 498 million, compared with 504 million in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods detailed on page 23 , adjusted net income was 660 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in adjusted after-tax earnings in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the prior-year quarter, was primarily due to higher production volumes, partially offset by lower realized selling prices in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Exploration and Production Results 
 In the third quarter of 2024, E P had net income of 489 million, compared with 529 million in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, adjusted net income was 651 million in the third quarter of 2024. Total net production averaged 461,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 395,000 boepd in the third quarter of 2023. The average realized crude oil selling price was 77.06 per barrel in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 81.53 per barrel, including the effect of hedging, in the third quarter of 2023. The average realized NGL selling price in the third quarter of 2024 was 20.91 per barrel, compared with 20.17 per barrel in the prior-year quarter, while the average realized natural gas selling price was 3.81 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 4.57 per mcf in the third quarter of 2023.

PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT'D.) 

 Overview (continued) 
 The following is an update of our ongoing E P activities in the third quarter: 
 In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken averaged 206,000 boepd for the third quarter of 2024 (2023 Q3: 190,000 boepd), primarily reflecting increased drilling and completion activity. NGL and natural gas volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts were 22,000 boepd in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 19,000 boepd in the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, we operated four rigs and drilled 32 wells, completed 36 wells, and brought 37 new wells online. We plan to continue operating four drilling rigs in the fourth quarter of 2024. We forecast net production to be in the range of 200,000 boepd to 205,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting lower anticipated volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts. 
 In the Gulf of Mexico, net production for the third quarter of 2024 averaged 38,000 boepd (2023 Q3: 28,000 boepd), primarily due to start-up of the Pickerel well (Hess 100 that achieved first production in late June 2024 as a tieback to the Tubular Bells production facility, partially offset by hurricane-related downtime during the third quarter of 2024. We continue to drill the exploration well at the Vancouver prospect (Hess 40 located in Green Canyon Block 287, and well results are anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30 ), offshore Guyana, net production totaled 170,000 bopd for the third quarter of 2024 (2023 Q3: 108,000 bopd), which included 25,000 bopd of tax barrels (2023 Q3: 14,000 bopd), primarily due to the start-up of the third development on the block, Payara, which commenced production in November 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, we sold 14 cargos of crude oil from Guyana compared with nine cargos in the prior-year quarter. We expect to sell 15 cargos of crude oil in the fourth quarter of 2024. We forecast net production to be in the range of 185,000 bopd to 190,000 bopd in the fourth quarter of 2024, which includes tax barrels of approximately 25,000 bopd, reflecting recovery from planned downtime in the third quarter of 2024. 
 The fourth development on the block, Yellowtail, was sanctioned in April 2022 with a production capacity of approximately 250,000 gross bopd and first production is expected in 2025. The fifth development, Uaru, was sanctioned in April 2023 with a production capacity of approximately 250,000 gross bopd and first production is expected in 2026. The sixth development, Whiptail, was sanctioned in April 2024 and is expected to add production capacity of approximately 250,000 gross bopd by the end of 2027. The application for the environmental permit for the seventh development, Hammerhead, has been filed with Guyana s Environmental Protection Agency. Pending government and regulatory approval and project sanctioning, the development is expected to have a production capacity in the range of 120,000 gross bopd to 180,000 gross bopd, with first oil anticipated in 2029. 
 At the Stabroek Block, the operator is currently drilling the Redmouth-1 exploration well, and well results are anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 In the Gulf of Thailand, net production from Block A-18 of the JDA averaged 20,000 boepd for the third quarter of 2024 (2023 Q3: 38,000 boepd), including contribution from unitized acreage in Malaysia. Net production from North Malay Basin, offshore Peninsular Malaysia, averaged 27,000 boepd for the third quarter of 2024 (2023 Q3: 31,000 boepd). Net production in JDA and Malaysia was lower in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to planned and unplanned maintenance at JDA and planned maintenance at North Malay Basin. 
 The following is an update of significant Midstream activities in the third quarter: 
 Hess Midstream LP completed an underwritten public equity offering of approximately 12.7 million Hess Midstream LP Class A shares held by an affiliate of GIP. We did not receive any proceeds from the public equity offering. 
 HESM Opco, a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream LP, repurchased approximately 2.8 million HESM Opco Class B units held by affiliates of Hess Corporation and GIP for 100 million of which we received proceeds of 38 million.

 Consolidated Results of Operations (continued) 
 Adjusted net income attributable to Hess Corporation is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as reported net income attributable to Hess Corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods, which are summarized on page 23 . Management uses adjusted net income to evaluate the Corporation s operating performance and believes that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities presented in this report is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as reported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities. Management uses net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to evaluate the Corporation s ability to internally fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and service debt and believes that investors understanding of our ability to generate cash to fund these items is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes working capital and other movements that may distort assessment of our performance between periods. 
 These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. 
 In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.

 (a) Reflects natural gas production converted based on relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. In addition, NGLs do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil. See the average selling prices in the table on page 20 . 
 We forecast total net production to be in the range of 475,000 boepd to 485,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 United States: North Dakota net production was higher in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily reflecting increased drilling and completion activity. Total offshore net production was higher in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to start-up of the Pickerel well (Hess 100 that achieved first production in late June 2024 as a tieback to the Tubular Bells production facility, partially offset by hurricane-related downtime during the third quarter of 2024. 
 International: Net production in Guyana was higher in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily due to the Prosperity FPSO, which commenced production in November 2023, partially offset by planned downtime in the third quarter of 2024. Net production from Guyana included 25,000 bopd and 29,000 bopd of tax barrels in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared with 14,000 bopd of tax barrels in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. Net production in Malaysia and JDA was lower in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily due to planned and unplanned maintenance at JDA and planned maintenance at North Malay Basin during the third quarter of 2024.

 Sales Volumes: Higher sales volumes in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased after-tax earnings by approximately 465 million and 1,510 million, respectively, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023. Net worldwide sales volumes from Hess net production, which excludes sales volumes of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas purchased from third parties, were as follows:

Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. In addition, NGLs do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil. See the average selling prices in the table on page 20 . 
 Marketing, including Purchased Oil and Gas: Marketing expense is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil, NGL and natural gas from our partners in Hess operated wells or other third parties, primarily in the United States, and transportation and other distribution costs for U.S. and Guyana marketing activities. Marketing expense was higher in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to higher purchased volumes. 
 Cash Operating Costs: Cash operating costs consist of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and E P general and administrative expenses. Cash operating costs increased in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to Guyana following the start-up of Payara in November 2023, and increased maintenance activity at North Dakota, and Malaysia and JDA. Cash operating costs increased in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to Guyana following the start-up of Payara in November 2023, increased maintenance activity at North Dakota, and Malaysia and JDA, and higher production and severance taxes in North Dakota due to higher volumes and crude oil prices, partially offset by lower workover costs in the Gulf of Mexico. On a per-unit basis, the decrease in cash operating costs in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily reflects the impact of the higher production volumes. 
 Midstream Tariffs Expense: Tariffs expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily due to higher throughput volumes. We estimate Midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of 360 million to 370 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD A): DD A expense was higher in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily due to higher production volumes from Guyana following the start-up of Payara in November 2023, and Offshore U.S. following start-up of the Pickerel well (Hess 100 in late June 2024. On a per-unit basis, the increase in DD A rate in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the corresponding period in 2023, was primarily due to new wells and facilities online in 2024 with a higher DD A rate. 
 Unit Costs: Unit cost per boe information is based on total net production volumes and excludes items affecting comparability of earnings as detailed on page 23 . Actual and forecast unit costs per boe are as follows:

 Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions) Exploratory dry hole costs (a) 4 4 67 97 Exploration lease impairment (b) 6 11 16 24 Geological and geophysical expense and exploration overhead 34 50 104 109 Total Exploration Expense 44 65 187 230 
 (a) Exploratory dry hole costs in the first nine months of 2024 primarily relates to previously capitalized exploratory wells (see Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods below) and the Trumpetfish-1 exploration well at the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. Exploratory dry hole costs in the first nine months of 2023 primarily relates to the Ephesus exploration well, offshore Newfoundland, Canada and the Kokwari-1 and Fish/Tarpon-1 exploration wells at the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. 
 (b) Exploration lease impairment for the third quarter of 2023 primarily relates to the relinquishment of our participating interest in the Kaieteur Block, offshore Guyana. 
 Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, are estimated to be in the range of 50 million to 55 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Income Taxes: E P income tax expense was 251 million and 865 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared with 203 million and 525 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense in the third quarter and first nine months 2024, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023, was primarily due to higher income tax expense in Guyana as a result of higher pre-tax income. 
 We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the United States (non-Midstream), while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. While we emerged from a recent cumulative loss position in the U.S. (non-Midstream) in 2023, there is not sufficient positive evidence to support a release of the valuation allowance. Until we see a more significant and sustained pattern of objectively verifiable income, we do not assign significant weight to subjective long-term projections of future income and thus maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. (non-Midstream) federal and state deferred tax assets. 
 E P income tax expense is expected to be in the range of 250 million to 260 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: 
 2024: 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a pre-tax charge of 92 million 92 million after income taxes) to fully impair the net book value of our interests in Conger, a mature field in the Gulf of Mexico, due to a mechanical issue on one of the main producing wells, and a pre-tax charge of 40 million 38 million after income taxes) resulting from revisions to our estimated abandonment liabilities for uneconomic properties, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico (See Note 8, Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). E P results also include a pre-tax charge of 35 million 32 million after income taxes), recorded to Other, net, resulting from amendments to the Corporation s pension plan in the United Kingdom, associated with the purchase of a bulk annuity policy as part of the ongoing process to settle the plan s liabilities (See Note 9, Retirement Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) . 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we recognized a pre-tax charge of 48 million 38 million after income taxes) to write-off previously capitalized exploration wells (See Note 3, Property, Plant and Equipment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) , and a pre-tax charge of 18 million 14 million after income taxes) related to materials and supplies inventory recorded to Operating costs and expenses , both in the JDA, based on the regulator s notification that the current production sharing contract (PSC) for JDA Block A-18 will not be re-awarded to the existing PSC contractors upon its expiration in 2029. 
 2023: 
 In the second quarter of 2023, we recognized a pre-tax charge of 82 million 82 million after income taxes) that resulted from revisions to our estimated abandonment obligations in the West Delta field in the Gulf of Mexico. These abandonment obligations were assigned to us as a former owner after they were discharged from Fieldwood Energy LLC as part of its approved bankruptcy plan in 2021. See Note 8, Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Midstream 
 Following is a summarized income statement for our Midstream operations: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions) Revenues and Non-Operating Income Sales and other operating revenues 379 363 1,100 992 Other, net 5 2 12 6 Total revenues and non-operating income 384 365 1,112 998 Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses 89 89 255 225 General and administrative expenses 6 6 17 18 Interest expense 53 46 152 132 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 52 48 152 142 Total costs and expenses 200 189 576 517 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes 184 176 536 481 Provision for income taxes 19 12 49 26 Net Income 165 164 487 455 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 96 98 285 266 Net Income Attributable to Hess Corporation 69 66 202 189 
 Sales and other operating revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily due to higher throughput volumes. Operating costs and expenses for the first nine months of 2024 increased, compared with the corresponding period in 2023, as a result of the higher throughput volumes and higher maintenance costs. Interest expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily due to a new 600 million 6.500 fixed-rate senior unsecured note issued during the second quarter of 2024. DD A expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily due to additional assets placed in service. Provision for income taxes for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily driven by increased ownership of HESM Opco by Hess Midstream LP following the equity offerings and unit repurchase transactions in 2023 and 2024. 
 Net income attributable to Hess Corporation from the Midstream segment is estimated to be in the range of 70 million to 75 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Corporate, Interest and Other 
 The following table summarizes Corporate, Interest and Other expenses:

 Corporate and other expenses, net were lower in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily due to lower legal and professional fees. Interest expense, net was lower in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily due to higher capitalized interest associated with the Yellowtail, Uaru, and Whiptail development projects in Guyana.

 Consolidated Results of Operations (continued) 
 Fourth quarter 2024 corporate and other expenses, net are expected to be approximately 25 million, and interest expense, net is expected to be in the range of 40 million to 45 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Other Items Potentially Affecting Future Results 
 Our future results may be impacted by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, volatility in the selling prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, reserve and production changes, asset sales, impairment charges and exploration expenses, industry cost inflation and/or deflation, changes in foreign exchange rates and income tax rates, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances, the effects of weather, crude oil storage capacity, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect our business, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II , Item 1A Risk Factors of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In millions, except ratio) Cash and cash equivalents (a) 1,864 1,688 Current portion of long-term debt 20 311 Total debt (b) 8,596 8,613 Total equity 11,602 9,602 Debt to capitalization ratio for debt covenants (c) 28.9 33.6 
 (a) Includes 11 million of cash and cash equivalents attributable to our Midstream segment at September 30, 2024 (December 31, 2023: 6 million) of which 10 million is held by Hess Midstream LP at September 30, 2024 (December 31, 2023: 5 million). 
 (b) Includes 3,490 million of debt outstanding from our Midstream segment at September 30, 2024 (December 31, 2023: 3,211 million) that is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. 
 (c) Total Consolidated Debt of Hess Corporation (including finance leases and excluding Midstream non-recourse debt) as a percentage of Total Capitalization of Hess Corporation as defined under Hess Corporation s revolving credit facility financial covenants. Total Capitalization excludes the impact of noncash impairment charges and non-controlling interests. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 4,288 2,598 Investing activities (3,196) (2,666) Financing activities (916) (400) Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents 176 (468) 
 Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was 4,288 million in the first nine months of 2024 (2023: 2,598 million), while net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was 4,832 million in the first nine months of 2024 (2023: 3,255 million). Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities increased in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to higher production volumes. During the first nine months of 2024, changes in operating assets and liabilities reduced cash flow from operating activities by 544 million primarily due to payments for abandonment activities, the purchase of REDD+ carbon credits in accordance with our long-term agreement with the Government of Guyana, and a payment in connection with a legal settlement related to our former downstream business, HONX, Inc. Changes in operating assets and liabilities in the first nine months of 2023 reduced cash flow from operating activities by 657 million primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable due to higher crude oil prices, premiums paid for crude oil hedge contracts and payments for abandonment activities. 
 Investing activities: Additions to property, plant and equipment of 3,190 million in the first nine months of 2024 were up 526 million, compared with the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to higher development activities in Guyana, and higher drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico and the Bakken.

PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT'D.) 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) 
 The following table reconciles capital expenditures incurred on an accrual basis to Additions to property, plant and equipment: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In millions) Additions to property, plant and equipment - E P: Capital expenditures incurred - E P (3,078) (2,587) Increase (decrease) in related liabilities 99 83 Additions to property, plant and equipment - E P (2,979) (2,504) Additions to property, plant and equipment - Midstream: Capital expenditures incurred - Midstream (204) (174) Increase (decrease) in related liabilities (7) 14 Additions to property, plant and equipment - Midstream (211) (160) 
 Financing activities: Common stock dividends paid were 425 million in the first nine months of 2024 (2023: 405 million) reflecting a 14 increase in our third quarter 2024 dividend on common stock. Net borrowings (repayments) of debt with maturities of 90 days or less related to the HESM Opco revolving credit facility. In the first nine months of 2023 the proceeds from the HESM Opco revolving credit facility were used primarily to finance the repurchase of HESM Opco Class B units. Borrowings in the first nine months of 2024 resulted from the issuance by HESM Opco of 600 million of 6.500 fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due in 2029, and the proceeds were primarily used to reduce debt outstanding under HESM Opco s revolving credit facility. Repayments of debt in the first nine months of 2024 primarily resulted from the 300 million principal amount of our 3.500 fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, which matured on July 15, 2024. Net cash outflows to noncontrolling interests were 459 million in the first nine months of 2024 (2023: 399 million) which included 187 million paid to GIP (2023: 150 million) for the repurchase by HESM Opco of GIP-owned Class B units. In the first nine months of 2023, we received net proceeds of 167 million from the public offering of Class A shares in Hess Midstream LP. 
 Noncash activities: Operating right-of-use assets recorded in exchange for lease liabilities in the first nine months of 2024 included 162 million related to the exercise of a renewal option for a deepwater drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 
 Future Capital Requirements and Resources 
 In July 2024, we repaid the outstanding 300 million principal amount of our 3.500 fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, which matured on July 15, 2024. In September 2024, we announced a 14 increase in our third quarter 2024 dividend on common stock to 0.50 per share. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Midstream, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately 5.2 billion. Our E P capital and exploratory expenditures are forecast to be approximately 4.9 billion for 2024, up from previous guidance of 4.2 billion reflecting the decision to accelerate the purchase of the Liza Destiny and Prosperity FPSOs to the fourth quarter of 2024 instead of in 2025. In 2025, based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we expect cash flow from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our capital investment and capital return programs. Depending on market conditions, we may take any of the following steps, or a combination thereof, to improve our liquidity and financial position: reduce the planned capital program and other cash outlays, including dividends, pursue asset sales, borrow against our committed revolving credit facility, or issue debt or equity securities. These actions are subject to certain limitations under the Merger Agreement. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024 for a discussion of risks related to the Merger.

 (a) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2025. 
 (b) This credit facility may only be utilized by HESM Opco and is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. 
 Hess Corporation: 
 The revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.400 above SOFR, though the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on the credit rating of the Corporation s senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced long-term debt. The revolving credit facility is subject to customary representations, warranties, customary events of default and covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65 , and a financial covenant limiting the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 15 (as these capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility). The indentures for the Corporation s fixed-rate senior unsecured notes limit the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as that term is defined in the indentures) to 15 . As of September 30, 2024, Hess Corporation was in compliance with these financial covenants. 
 We have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. 
 Midstream: 
 At September 30, 2024, HESM Opco had 1.4 billion of senior secured syndicated credit facilities, consisting of a 1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a 400 million term loan facility. Borrowings under the term loan facility will generally bear interest at SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.650 to 2.550 , while the applicable margin for the syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.375 to 2.050 . Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest-rate margins are based on HESM Opco s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities). If HESM Opco obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on HESM Opco s credit ratings in effect from time to time. The credit facilities contain covenants that require HESM Opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (5.50 to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to HESM Opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. HESM Opco was in compliance with these financial covenants at September 30, 2024. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of the assets of HESM Opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, including equity interests directly owned by such entities, subject to certain customary exclusions. At September 30, 2024, borrowings of 30 million were drawn under HESM Opco s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of 390 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn under HESM Opco s term loan facility. Borrowings under these credit facilities are non-recourse to Hess Corporation. 
 Credit Ratings: 
 All three major credit rating agencies that rate the senior unsecured debt of Hess Corporation have assigned an investment grade credit rating. At September 30, 2024, our credit ratings were BBB- at S P Global Ratings, Baa3 at Moody s Investors Service, and BBB at Fitch Ratings. Subsequent to the announcement of the Merger all three agencies placed our credit ratings on review for positive action in connection with the Merger. 
 At September 30, 2024, HESM Opco s senior unsecured debt is rated BB+ by S P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, and Ba2 by Moody s Investors Service.

 Market Risk Disclosures 
 We are exposed in the normal course of business to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values . See Note 13, Financial Risk Management Activities , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 We have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling 202 million at September 30, 2024 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies. The change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10 strengthening or weakening in the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a gain or loss of approximately 20 million at September 30, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, our long-term debt, which was substantially comprised of fixed-rate instruments, had a carrying value of 8,596 million and a fair value of 9,021 million. A 15 increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately 390 million or 415 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024. Any changes in interest rates do not impact our cash outflows associated with fixed-rate interest payments or settlement of debt principal, unless a debt instrument is repurchased prior to maturity.

 Based upon their evaluation of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024, John B. Hess, Chief Executive Officer, and John P. Rielly, Chief Financial Officer, concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 There was no change in internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Information regarding legal proceedings is contained in Note 11, Guarantees and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference. Pursuant to Item 103(c)(3)(iii) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act, we are required to disclose certain information about environmental proceedings to which a governmental authority is a party if we reasonably believe such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, above a stated threshold. We have elected to apply a threshold of 1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. 
 Merger 
 Stockholder Suits 
 In connection with the Merger Agreement, two lawsuits were filed challenging the sufficiency of the disclosures made in connection therewith. First, a complaint was filed in federal court as an individual action. The complaint is captioned as Globokar v. Hess Corporation , et al. , 24-cv-01723 (filed March 6, 2024 in the Southern District of New York). It alleged, among other things, that the preliminary proxy statement filed on February 26, 2024 in connection with the Merger Agreement misrepresented and/or omitted certain purportedly material information and sought, among other things an injunction enjoining the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Second, a putative class-action complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery under the caption Assad v . Hess Corporation, et al. , C.A. No. 2024-0468-NAC (filed May 2, 2024). It alleged that Hess Board of Directors breached its fiduciary duties by failing to disclose purportedly material information in the definitive proxy statement filed on April 26, 2024 and sought, among other things an injunction enjoining the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including a preliminary injunction against the closing of the transaction) unless and until the allegedly omitted material information was disclosed. 
 In addition to these lawsuits, several purported stockholders of Hess sent demand letters alleging similar deficiencies regarding the disclosures made in the proxy statement. 
 In order to avoid the risk that the lawsuits or demand letters delay or otherwise adversely affect the Merger, and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, Hess provided supplemental disclosures to the definitive proxy statement filed in connection with the Merger Agreement in Hess s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on May 21, 2024. On May 31, 2024, the individual plaintiff in the above-captioned Assad v . Hess Corporation, et al. , C.A. No. 2024-0468-NAC filed a notice voluntarily dismissing the action without prejudice. On June 5, 2024, the individual plaintiff in the above-captioned Globokar v. Hess Corporation , et al. , 24-cv-01723, filed a notice voluntarily dismissing the action without prejudice and the matter has been dismissed. 
 Hess believes that these matters are without merit and intends to defend against demands or filed actions relating to the Merger. If additional similar complaints are filed or demands sent, Hess will not necessarily disclose such additional filings or demands. Hess cannot predict the outcomes of these matters. 
 Arbitration 
 On March 6, 2024, an affiliate of Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon Mobil) commenced arbitration proceedings regarding the applicability of the Stabroek ROFR to the Merger pursuant to the dispute resolution requirements of the Stabroek operating agreement (the Stabroek JOA). On March 11, 2024 and March 15, 2024, Hess Guyana Exploration Limited (HGEL) and an affiliate of China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), respectively, commenced parallel arbitration proceedings regarding the applicability of the Stabroek ROFR to the Merger pursuant to the dispute resolution requirements of the Stabroek JOA. On March 26, 2024, following a joint application by the parties, the authority administering the arbitration consolidated the three arbitration proceedings. The arbitration merits hearing about the applicability of the Stabroek ROFR to the Merger has been scheduled for May 2025, with a decision expected in the following three months. 
 HGEL has asserted in these arbitration proceedings that the Stabroek ROFR does not apply to the Merger due to the structure of the Merger and the language of the Stabroek ROFR provisions. The Exxon Mobil affiliate and the CNOOC affiliate have asserted in these arbitration proceedings that the Stabroek ROFR applies to the Merger. Chevron and Hess believe that Exxon Mobil s and CNOOC s asserted claims are without merit. HGEL intends to vigorously defend its position in the arbitration proceedings and expects the arbitration tribunal will confirm that the Stabroek ROFR does not apply to the Merger. However, the outcome of any arbitration proceedings regarding the applicability of the Stabroek ROFR to the Merger is uncertain.
