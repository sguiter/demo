Unless otherwise specified in this quarterly report, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to common stock refer to shares of our common stock. As used in this quarterly report, the terms we , us , our and our company means PetroGas Company, unless otherwise indicated. Corporate Overview We were incorporated under the name Alazzio Entertainment Corp. on January 24, 2014, under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our original business plan was to operate photo booth rentals. On April 3, 2015, a change in control occurred by virtue of our company s largest shareholder, Dmitri Kapsumun selling 900,000 shares (split adjusted) of our common stock to Rise Fast Limited, a Hong Kong corporation. Such shares represented 71.77 of our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As part of the sale of the shares, Rise Fast Limited arranged with the resigning member of our company s Board of Directors, to appoint Mr. Huang Yu as the sole officer and director of our company. On April 16, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the Nevada SOS whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by increasing our authorized number of shares of common stock from 75 million to 300 million (not adjusted for the one (1) for one hundred (100) stock split) and increasing all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of fifteen (15) shares for every one (1) share held. Our Board of Directors approved this amendment on April 15, 2015 and shareholders holding 71.77 of our issued and outstanding shares approved this amendment via a written consent executed on April 16, 2015. Effective April 29, 2015 we changed our name to America Resources Exploration Inc. by way of a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, incorporated solely for the purpose of the change of name. On June 10, 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Zheng Xiangwu, a resident of Guang Dong Province, China, whereby we issued 40,000 million shares of its common stock in exchange for rights to certain oil and gas leases located in Frio and Atascosa Counties, Texas, consisting of a total of 714 total acres of land, two (2) working wells and a total of seven (7) wells (the Leases ). The acquisition of the Leases pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement was completed on June 1, 2015. As a result of the completion of this acquisition, 40,000 shares of our company s common stock were issued to Mr. Zheng Xiangwu, who owns our company s largest shareholder, Rise Fast Limited. The number of shares issued to Mr. Zheng was determined by valuing the Leases at 160,000 and valuing our company s stock at 0.04 per share. At the completion of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we entered into the oil and gas industry. 13 Table of Contents On June 11, 2015, we entered into various assignment agreements with Mr. Zheng for the acquisition of multiple oil and gas leases and overriding royalty interests ORR s as set out in the table below. From July 6, 2015 through July 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of such oil and gas leases and ORR s, whereby we issued a total of 6,500 shares of our common stock to Mr. Zheng.

Texas June 11 th , 2015 Madison County Wellbore Interest Texas June 11 th , 2015 Shelby County Wellbore Interest Texas June 11 th , 2015 Emergy County Lease Purchase Utah On June 12, 2015, we acquired three (3) producing leases covering 714 acres situated in Atascosa and Frio Counties, Texas, located in the Eagle Ford Shale formation - the Jane Burns C Burns ), the Theo Rogers C , and the Theo Rogers A D Rogers Leases. We acquired a 99.5 working interest (74.625 net revenue interest) in each lease. The Burns and Rogers Leases provide exploration and production opportunities in the Kyote Field pay zone, very near the Eagle Ford Shale play with access to available rig crews and other vendor-servicers, due to their close proximity to San Antonio, Texas. The Burns and Rogers Leases hold collectively seven (7) oil wells, but none of which are operating wells. Although our company s management and industry professionals believed at the time that they were acquired that our company could double or triple previous production on these wells, depressed oil prices indicate that the cost to bring these wells online an uneconomical venture. On August 13, 2015 we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Inceptus Resources, LLC whereby our company acquired a 78 net revenue interest in 200 acres located in Callahan County, Texas, and a 78 net revenue interest in 522 acres also located in Callahan County, Texas. On January 20, 2016, we changed our name to PetroGas Company, by way of a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, incorporated solely for the purpose of the change of name. In addition, we amended our Articles of Incorporation for a reverse stock split by decreasing all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio one (1) new for one hundred (100) old shares of common stock. The reverse stock split was approved by our directors and shareholders holding 68.65 of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on January 13, 2016 and the reverse stock split became effective with FINRA on March 7, 2016. The change of name resulted in a change of trading symbol to PTCO . On November 30, 2016, we acquired various royalty interests in Texas for 10,485. On December 14, 2016, we acquired two oil and gas leases in Ohio for 2,705. On January 1, 2017, our company acquired the lease for three oil and gas properties for 4,975. On September 13, 2017, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by decreasing all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of one (1) share for every one hundred (100) shares held. Our Board of Directors approved the Amendment on July 21, 2017 and Shareholders holding 75.95 of our company s shares approved the Amendment via written consent executed on July 21, 2017, with an effective date of October 5, 2017. On February 20, 2019 a majority of our shareholders and our board of directors approved a resolution to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a one (1) new for 100 old basis. The reverse split was approved by FINRA with an effective date of March 19, 2019. As a result of the reverse split, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock decreased from 30,099,230 to 300,993 shares of common stock. Our authorized capital remained unchanged. On February 6, 2024, we acquired an oil and gas lease in Tarrant County, Texas. The lease covers 12.1 acres of land located in the Robert R Ramey Survey and is for a period of 1.5 years. 14 Table of Contents Our principal executive offices are located at 2800 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 4100, Houston, Texas 77056. Our telephone number is (832) 899-8597. We have never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding. We hold a 94 interest in Seabourn Oil Company, LLC, a Texas LLC. Future Operations We are actively seeking to acquire producing and non-producing leases that will allow us to explore and drill in high-profile pay zones. We intend to raise capital at a low cost from private placements so that we may acquire numerous additional leases, and to commence drilling, and taking advantage of the inevitable uptick in oil prices to come. In the current climate, our company believes that there are a very large number of oil gas leases under distress due to the depressed gas prices and that we can strategically position our company to acquire as many of these leases as possible at a discount to market value, hence creating shareholder value. We are planning an exploration strategy to drill new wells on the current leases, as well as acquire deeper rights in order to drill some of the wells at great depths. We expect that reservoirs at those depths could yield a very high daily output of oil. Results of Operations We have earned limited royalty revenues since inception.
