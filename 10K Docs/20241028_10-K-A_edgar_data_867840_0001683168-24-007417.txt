Date, solely for the purpose of including the information required by Items 10 through 14 of Part III of Form 10-K. This information was
previously omitted from the Original 10-K in reliance on General Instruction G(3) to Form 10-K, which permits the information in the above
referenced items to be incorporated in the Original 10-K by reference from our definitive proxy statement so long as such proxy statement
is filed no later than 120 days after our fiscal year-end. We are filing this Amendment No. 1 to include the Part III information in the

GOVERNANCE OF THE COMPANY 

Board Leadership Structure 

Mr. Woodward has served as
our Chairman of our Board of Directors since July 9, 2014. Dr. Forkey has been our Chief Executive Officer, President and Treasurer since
February 8, 2011. Dr. Forkey manages the day-to-day affairs of our Company and leads the Board meetings. Dr. Miles, who has served on
our Board of Directors since November 2005 and Mr. Miclot, who has served on our Board since March 2016, are independent directors. Our
Board believes that having a majority of independent directors serves our Company well. The Board believes that its structure should be
informed by the needs and circumstances of our Company, the Board, and our shareholders. With this in mind, the Board believes that its
structure is currently serving our Company well, and intends to maintain this as appropriate and practicable in the future. 

Risk Oversight of Management 

The Board of Directors oversees
management regarding our Company s risks. Our management keeps the Board of Directors apprised of significant risks facing our Company
and the approach being taken to understand, manage and mitigate such risks. Additional review or reporting on enterprise risks is conducted
as needed or as requested by the Board of Directors. 

Director Nominations 

The Board of Directors nominates
directors for election at each annual meeting of shareholders and appoints new directors to fill vacancies when they arise. The Board
is responsible for the identification, evaluation, recruitment of qualified candidates to the Board of Directors for nomination or election.
It is the policy of the Company that the Board seek recommendations from the independent directors as to each person considered for nomination
or election as a director. 

One of the Board of Directors 
objectives in evaluating director nominations is to ensure that its membership is composed of experienced and dedicated individuals with
a diversity of backgrounds, perspectives and skills. The Board selects nominees for director based on the nominee's character, judgment,
diversity of experience, business acumen, and ability to act on behalf of all shareholders. We do not have a formal diversity policy;
however, the Board endeavors to have a Board representing diverse viewpoints as well as diverse expertise at policy-making levels in many
areas, including business, accounting and finance, manufacturing, marketing and sales, education, legal, government affairs, regulatory
affairs, research and development, business development, technology and in other areas that are relevant to our activities. 

3 

The Board believes that nominees
for director should have experience, such as those mentioned above, that may be useful to our Company and the Board of Directors, high
personal and professional ethics and the willingness and ability to devote sufficient time to carry out effectively their duties as directors.
The Board believes it is appropriate for at least one, and, preferably, multiple, members of the Board of Directors to meet the criteria
for an audit committee financial expert as defined by rules of the SEC, and for a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors to meet the definition of independent director as defined by the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The Board also believes
it is appropriate for key members of our management to participate as members of the Board of Directors. Prior to each annual meeting
of shareholders, the Board identifies nominees first by evaluating the current directors whose term will expire at the annual meeting
and who are willing to continue in service. These candidates are evaluated based on the criteria described above, including as demonstrated
by the candidate s prior service as a director, and the needs of the Board of Directors with respect to the particular talents and
experience of its directors. In the event that a director does not wish to continue in service, the Board determines not to re-nominate
the director, a vacancy is created on the Board of Directors as a result of a resignation, an increase in the size of the Board or other
event, the Board will consider various candidates for Board membership, including those suggested by Board members, officers, employees,
customers, vendors, by an executive search firm engaged by the Board or by shareholders. 

The Board of Directors will
consider candidates for director positions that are recommended by any of our stockholders. Any such recommendation should be provided
to our Secretary. The recommended candidate should be submitted to us in writing addressed to our Secretary, c/o Precision Optics Corporation,
Inc., 22 East Broadway, Gardner, Massachusetts 01440. The recommendation should include the following information: name of candidate;
address, phone and fax number of candidate; a statement signed by the candidate certifying that the candidate wishes to be considered
for nomination to our Board of Directors and stating why the candidate believes that he or she would be a valuable addition to our Board
of Directors; a summary of the candidate s work experience for the prior five years and the number of shares of our stock beneficially
owned by the candidate. 

The Board will evaluate the
recommended candidate and shall determine whether or not to proceed with the candidate in accordance with our procedures. We reserve the
right to change our procedures at any time to comply with the requirements of applicable laws. 

Committees of the Board of Directors 

The Board of Directors has the responsibility for establishing
broad corporate policies and reviewing our overall performance rather than day-to-day operations. The Board s primary responsibility
is to oversee management of our Company and, in so doing, serve the best interests of our Company and our stockholders. 

Our Board of Directors has the ability to establish, or disband,
such committees as necessary or appropriate to serve the needs of our Company. For many years, our full Board of Directors performed all
of the functions normally designated to an audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee. Recently, the Board decided
to designate an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee, in part to satisfy Nasdaq Stock Markets requirements in contemplation of
our Nasdaq listing application. 

Our Board of Directors has not established a nominating
committee of the Board of Directors. Outside of the process provided by Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, we do not have a formal policy
concerning stockholder recommendations of candidates for board of director membership and our bylaws do not provide for stockholders to
submit proposals or director nominees for consideration at our annual meetings. Our Board views that such a formal policy is not necessary
at the present time given the Board of Directors willingness to consider candidates recommended by Board members, officers, employees,
customers, vendors, by an executive search firm engaged by the Board, or by stockholders. Stockholders may recommend candidates by writing
to our Secretary at our principal offices: c/o Precision Optics Corporation, Inc., 22 East Broadway, Gardner, Massachusetts 01440. The
recommendation should include the following information: name of candidate; address, phone and fax number of candidate; a statement signed
by the candidate certifying that the candidate wishes to be considered for nomination to our Board of Directors and stating why the candidate
believes that he or she would be a valuable addition to our Board of Directors; a summary of the candidate s work experience for
the prior five years and the number of shares of our stock beneficially owned by the candidate.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
was established by the Board in July 2022 and is currently composed of Messrs. Woodward (Chair), Miclot and Miles. The Audit Committee

has adopted a charter, which is available on the Investor Relations portion of the Company s website located at https://www.poci.com/investor-relations. 

The Board of Directors has made a determination
that Peter H. Woodward, Chairman of the Board and Chair of the Audit Committee, qualifies as an audit committee financial expert and meets
the criteria set forth in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. Mr. Woodward is an independent director as independence is currently
defined in Rule 5605(d)(2) of the Nasdaq Stock Markets listing standards and SEC Rule 10A-3. Mr. Woodward has an understanding of generally
accepted accounting principles and financial statements and has the ability to assess the general application of such principles in connection
with the accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves, and has an understanding of internal controls over financial reporting as well

Compensation Committee 

The Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors was established by the Board in May 2022 and is currently composed of Messrs. Woodward and Miclot (Chair). The Compensation

Under its charter, the Compensation Committee
of the Board acts on behalf of the Board to review and oversee the Company s overall compensation philosophy, and to oversee the
development and implementation of compensation programs aligned with the Company s business strategy. Specifically, the Compensation
Committee s authority includes reviewing and approving annually the corporate goals and objectives applicable to the compensation
of the chief executive officer , and to evaluate at least annually the CEO s performance in light of those goals and objectives,
and determine and approve the CEO s compensation level based on that evaluation. In evaluating and determining CEO compensation,
the Committee considers the results of the most recent stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation Say on Pay Vote required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act. The CEO is not allowed to be present during any voting or deliberations by the Committee
on CEO compensation. Additionally, the Compensation Committee approves the compensation of all other executive officers, in consultation
with the CEO. In evaluating and determining executive compensation, the Committee considers the results of the most recent Say on Pay
Vote. The Compensation Committee also makes recommendations to the Board regarding the adoption of Stock Plans and equity-based plans,
which includes the ability to amend and terminate such plans. The Compensation Committee has the authority to administer the Company s
Stock Plans and equity-based plans, including designation of the employees to whom the awards are to be granted, the amount of the award
or equity to be granted and the terms and conditions applicable to each award or grant, subject to the provisions of each plan. The Compensation
Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company s submission to a stockholder vote of matters relating to compensation, including
advisory votes on executive compensation and the frequency of such votes, incentive and other compensation plans, and amendments to such
plans. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for performing any other activities required by applicable law, rules or regulations,
including the rules of the SEC and any exchange or market on which the Company s capital stock is traded, and performs other activities
that are consistent with the Compensation Committee s charter, the Company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and
governing laws, as the Compensation Committee or the Board deems necessary or appropriate. 

The charter of the Compensation Committee grants
the Compensation Committee full access to all books, records, facilities and personnel of the Company. In addition, under the charter,
the Compensation Committee has the discretion and authority to obtain, at Company expense, advice and assistance from compensation consultants
and internal and external legal, accounting or other advisors and other external resources that the Compensation Committee considers necessary
or appropriate in the performance of its duties.

Delinquent Section
16(a) Reports 

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, requires our directors, executive officers and persons who own more than 10 of a registered class of our securities
to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 3 (Initial
Statement of Beneficial Ownership), 4 (Statement of Changes of Beneficial Ownership of Securities) and 5 (Annual Statement of Beneficial
Ownership of Securities). Officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with
copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 

Based solely upon a review of reports provided
to us by our officers and directors, we believe that, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, no person required to file reports under
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 failed to file such reports on a timely basis during such fiscal year except for
the following: a Form 4 for Richard B. Miles due on December 30, 2023 and filed on October 28, 2024. 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a written code of ethics that
applies to our directors, principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller and any
persons performing similar functions. The code of ethics has been filed as Exhibit 14.1 to our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We intend to disclose any future amendments to, or waivers from, the code of ethics within four business days of the waiver or amendment
through a website posting or by filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC. 

Insider Trading Policy 

Our Board has adopted an Insider Trading Policy
that applies to all of our directors, executive officers, and employees. The policy attempts to establish standards that will avoid even
the appearance of improper conduct on the part of insiders by requiring, among other things, that insiders maintain the confidentiality
of information about the Company and to not engage in transactions in the Company s securities while aware of material nonpublic
information. 

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. 

Named Executive Officers 

This Annual Report contains
information about the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers, as defined by Item 402(m)(2) of Regulation S-K, during our fiscal
year ended June 30, 2024. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for smaller reporting
companies, we determined that the following officers were our Named Executive Officers: 

Joseph N. Forkey, Chief Executive Officer, President, Treasurer and Director; 

Wayne M. Coll, Chief Financial Officer; and 

Mahesh Lawande, Chief Operating Officer. 

Compensation Overview 

We qualify as a smaller
reporting company under the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we have elected to comply with the
disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies. Accordingly, this executive compensation summary is not intended to
meet the Compensation Discussion and Analysis disclosure required of larger reporting companies.

Role of the Board 

The Board of Directors has
authorized the Compensation Committee to oversee and determine executive compensation, and review our major compensation plans, policies,
and programs. All compensation for our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer is determined by the Compensation Committee.
The Compensation Committee is charged with the responsibility of reviewing the performance and establishing the total compensation of
our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer on an annual basis. The Compensation Committee often discusses compensation
matters with the Board as part of our regularly scheduled Board meetings. The Compensation Committee administers our incentive plans and
is responsible for approving grants of equity awards under such plans. We believe that our Compensation Committee adequately fulfilled
its role in overseeing our compensation policies in the past. 

Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 

Due to the size of our Company,
the performance of our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Operating Officer directly affects all aspects
of our results. Consequently, our compensation philosophy is to reward these executive officers for the achievement of short- and long-term
corporate and individual performance, as measured by the attainment of specific goals for the creation of long-term shareholder value.
Also, to ensure that we are strategically and competitively positioned for the future, the Board has the discretion to attribute significant
weight to other factors in determining executive compensation, such as maintaining competitiveness, expanding markets, pursuing growth
opportunities and achieving other long-range business and operating objectives. The level of compensation should also allow us to attract,
motivate, and retain talented executive officers that contribute to our long-term success. The compensation of our Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer is comprised of cash compensation and long-term incentive compensation in the form
of base salary, restricted stock and stock options with the possibility to earn bonuses. 

Summary Compensation Table for the Years Ended June 30,

Granting of Certain Equity Awards Close in
Time to the Release of Material Nonpublic Information 

We do not grant equity awards in anticipation
of the release of material nonpublic information that is likely to result in changes to the price of our common stock, and do not time
the public release of such information based on award grant dates. During the last completed fiscal year, we have not made awards to any
named executive officer during the period beginning four business days before and ending one business day after the filing of a period
report on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K or the filing or furnishing of a current report on Form 8-K, and we have not timed the disclosure of
material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation. 

Recoupment Policy 

We adopted the Precision Optics Corporation, Inc.
Clawback Policy effective as of October 2, 2023. In the event we are required to prepare an accounting restatement of our financial statements
due to our material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the Board will require reimbursement
or forfeiture of any excess incentive compensation received by any covered executive during the three completed fiscal years immediately
preceding the date on which we are required to prepare an accounting restatement. Clawback or recoupment policy in our executive
compensation program contributes to creating and maintaining a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and reinforces the
performance-based principles underlying our executive compensation program.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS
AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. 

Policies and Procedures for Related Party Transactions 

It is our policy that all
employees, officers and directors must avoid any activity that is or has the appearance of conflicting with the interests of our Company.
Our Board reviews all related party transactions for potential conflict of interest situations on an ongoing basis and all such transactions
relating to executive officers and directors must be approved by the Board. In carrying out this responsibility, the Board has determined
that we do not have any related party transactions. 

Director Independence 

The rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, or the Nasdaq
Rules, require a majority of a listed company s board of directors to be composed of independent directors. In addition, the Nasdaq
Rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company s audit, compensation and nominating and governance
committees be independent. Under the Nasdaq Rules, a director will only qualify as an independent director if, in the opinion of our Board
of Directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out
the responsibilities of a director. The Nasdaq Rules also require that audit committee members satisfy independence criteria set forth
in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. In order to be considered independent for purposes
of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit
committee, the board of directors, or any other board committee, accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory
fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries.
In considering the independence of compensation committee members, the Nasdaq Rules require that our board of directors must consider
additional factors relevant to the duties of a compensation committee member, including the source of any compensation we pay to the director
and any affiliations with our company. 

Our board of directors undertook a review of the
composition of our board of directors and its committees and the independence of each director. Based upon information requested from
and provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our board
of directors has determined that Messrs. Woodward, Miclot, and Miles are independent as defined under the Nasdaq Rules.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and
Procedures 

In consultation with
our Chief Financial Officer, the Audit Committee pre-approves all services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm.
100 of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors either before or after the respective services
were rendered. The Board of Directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by Stowe Degon LLC and believes that the
provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining the firm s independence.
