 and as of November 22, 2024 and February 23, 2024, respectively. The fair value of our total debt is measured using a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market interest rates for similar types of instruments and was and as of November 22, 2024 and February 23, 2024, respectively. The estimation of the fair value of our total debt is based on Level 2 fair value measurements. 
 Starting in Q1 2025, we invested in a managed investment portfolio which consists of corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities and U.S. government debt securities. These investments are considered available-for-sale and are classified as Short-term investments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of November 22, 2024, the fair value of our Short-term investments was . We have instructed our investment manager to operate under a mandate to keep the average duration of investments under two years. Fair values for these investments are based upon valuations for identical or similar instruments in active markets, with the resulting net unrealized holding gains or losses reflected net of tax as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cost basis for these investments, determined using the specific identification method, was and unrealized gains were as of November 22, 2024. Of our total short-term investments, mature within one year and mature after one year through five years. 
 We may use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The use of these financial instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intention to reduce our risk of volatility. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. 
 In connection with the acquisition of Viccarbe Habitat, S.L in Q3 2022, up to an additional (or is payable to the sellers based upon the achievement of certain revenue and operating income targets over a three-year period ending Q4 2025. This amount was considered to be contingent consideration and was treated for accounting purposes as part of the total purchase price of the acquisition. We used the Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date, which represents a Level 3 measurement. At each subsequent reporting date, changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded to Operating expenses until the liability is settled. As of November 22, 2024, the fair value of the contingent consideration was based upon current projections for the Viccarbe business over the earnout period. The settlement of the contingent consideration could vary from this estimate based upon actual operating performance of the business during the earnout period compared to the underlying assumptions used in the estimation of fair value, including revenue and operating income projections, and changes to discount rates.

 performance units ("PSUs") to certain employees which are earned over the period of 2025 through 2027 (the "2025 PSUs"). These PSUs are earned based on performance conditions and a market condition which were established by the Compensation Committee in Q1 2025, and thus the 2025 PSUs were considered granted in Q1 2025. 
 In Q1 2024 and Q1 2023, we issued PSUs to certain employees which are earned over a three-year performance period based on performance conditions established annually by the Compensation Committee within the first three months of the applicable fiscal year, as follows: 
 PSUs to be earned over the period of 2024 through 2026 (the "2024 PSUs") and 
 PSUs to be earned over the period of 2023 through 2025 (the "2023 PSUs"). 
 The number of PSUs earned under the 2024 PSUs and the 2023 PSUs are modified based on achievement of certain total shareholder return results relative to a comparison group of companies, which is a market condition. When the performance conditions for a fiscal year are established for these PSUs, one-third of the PSUs issued are considered granted. Therefore, each of the three fiscal years within the performance period is considered an individual tranche of the award (referred to as "Tranche 1," "Tranche 2" and "Tranche 3," respectively). As of November 22, 2024, the 2024 PSUs and 2023 PSUs were considered granted as follows: 
 In Q1 2025, the performance conditions were established for Tranche 2 of the 2024 PSUs and Tranche 3 of the 2023 PSUs, and accordingly, such tranches were considered granted in Q1 2025. 
 In Q1 2024, the performance conditions were established for Tranche 1 of the 2024 PSUs and Tranche 2 of the 2023 PSUs, and accordingly, such tranches were considered granted in Q1 2024. 
 In Q1 2023, the performance conditions were established for Tranche 1 of the 2023 PSUs, and accordingly, such tranche was considered granted in Q1 2023. 
 Once granted, the PSUs are expensed and recorded in Additional paid-in capital on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets over the remaining performance period. The expense for PSUs is determined based on the probability that the performance conditions will be met, and if applicable, the fair value of the market condition on the grant date. For participants who are or become retirement-eligible during the performance period, the PSUs are expensed over the period ending on the date the participant becomes retirement-eligible. The awards will be forfeited if a participant leaves the company for reasons other than retirement, disability or death or if the participant engages in any competition with us, as defined in the Steelcase Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan ("Incentive Compensation Plan"). 
 We used the Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the fair value of the market conditions on the respective grant dates, which resulted in a total fair value of , and for the PSUs with market conditions granted in 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that remained outstanding as of November 22, 2024.

 After completion of the performance period, the number of PSUs earned will be issued as shares of Class A Common Stock. A dividend equivalent is calculated based on the actual number of PSUs earned at the end of the performance period equal to the dividends that would have been payable on the earned PSUs had they been held during the entire performance period as Class A Common Stock. At the end of the performance period, the dividend equivalents are paid in the form of cash.

 Restricted Stock Units 
 During the nine months ended November 22, 2024, we awarded restricted stock units ("RSUs") to certain employees. RSUs have restrictions on transfer which lapse up to three years after the date of grant, at which time the RSUs are issued as unrestricted shares of Class A Common Stock. RSUs are expensed and recorded in Additional paid-in capital on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets over the requisite service period based on the value of the shares on the grant date. For participants who are or become retirement-eligible during the service period, the RSUs are expensed over the period ending on the date that the participant becomes retirement-eligible. Typically, these awards will be forfeited if a participant leaves the company for reasons other than retirement, disability or death or if the participant engages in any competition with us, as defined in the Incentive Compensation Plan.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: 
 This management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("MD A") should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 23, 2024. Reference to a year relates to the fiscal year, ended in February of the year indicated, rather than the calendar year, unless indicated by a specific date. Additionally, Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 reference the first, second, third and fourth quarter, respectively, of the fiscal year indicated. All amounts are in millions, except share and per share data, data presented as a percentage or as otherwise indicated. 
 This item contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the condensed consolidated statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company. The non-GAAP financial measures used are (1) organic revenue growth (decline), (2) adjusted operating income (loss) and (3) adjusted earnings per share. We have provided a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the tables below. These measures are supplemental to, and should be used in conjunction with, the most comparable GAAP measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and evaluate financial results and trends. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a description of these measures and why management believes they are also useful to investors.

 Overview 
 In Q3 2025, we grew revenue by 2 compared to Q3 2024 which was driven by improvement in volume growth despite soft demand in our International markets. Revenue increased by 5 in the Americas which benefited from a higher percentage of the beginning backlog shipping during the quarter and included higher revenue from government, large corporate, healthcare and education customers. International revenue decreased by 6 driven by declines in most markets in Asia Pacific, except India, and France. 
 In the prior year, our operating results reflected a 9.5 benefit from a decrease in the valuation of a contingent earnout liability and 5.4 of gains related to the sale of fixed assets, including land. Excluding these items, we improved our year-over-year operating income driven by the revenue growth in the Americas and benefits from cost reduction initiatives, including from our previously announced restructuring actions. Orders (adjusted for the impact of a divestiture and currency translation effects) declined by 1 in Q3 2025 compared to the prior year, with 2 growth in the Americas and an 8 decline in International. 
 During Q3 2025, we finalized the annuitization of a defined benefit pension plan in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and recorded a pre-tax, non-cash settlement charge of 15.2 to Other income (expense), net which had the effect of decreasing diluted earnings per share by 0.10, after taking into account the related tax effects. We also continued to invest in our business transformation initiative and planned implementation of our new enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system, and we expect to begin amortizing the capitalized development costs from this project in 2026. 
 Q3 2025 Compared to Q3 2024 
 We recorded net income of 19.1 and diluted earnings per share of 0.16 in Q3 2025 compared to net income of 30.8 and diluted earnings per share of 0.26 in the prior year. In Q3 2025, the results included a non-cash settlement charge of 15.2 to Other income (expense), net related to the accelerated recognition of accumulated actuarial losses due to the annuitization of a defined benefit pension plan and an associated 3.5 discrete income tax benefit, which had the net effect of decreasing net income by 11.7 and diluted earnings per share by 0.10. 
 Operating income of 41.0 in Q3 2025 represented a decline of 2.8 compared to operating income of 43.8 in the prior year. Operating income in the prior year reflected a 9.5 benefit from a decrease in the valuation of a contingent earnout liability and 5.4 of gains related to the sale of fixed assets, including land. Excluding these items, the increase in operating income was driven by revenue growth in the Americas which improved gross margin. We reported adjusted operating income of 47.3 and adjusted earnings per share of 0.30 in Q3 2025 compared to adjusted operating income of 49.3 and adjusted earnings per share of 0.29 in the prior year. 
 Revenue of 794.9 in Q3 2025 represented an increase of 17.0 or 2 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by volume growth in the Americas, partially offset by a 1 decline from the impact of a divestiture and lower revenue in International. Revenue increased by 5 in the Americas which included growth from government, large corporate, healthcare and education customers. International revenue decreased by 6 driven by declines in most markets in Asia Pacific, except India, and France. On an organic basis, revenue in Q3 2025 represented growth of 3 compared to the prior year, with 7 growth in the Americas but an 8 decline in International. 
 Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue improved by approximately 120 basis points in Q3 2025 compared to the prior year. The improvement was driven by benefits from higher revenue and cost reduction initiatives, including savings from restructuring actions. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue improved by 190 basis points in the Americas but increased by 190 basis points in International. 
 Operating expenses increased by 17.3 in Q3 2025, or 160 basis points as a percentage of revenue, compared to the prior year. Operating expenses in the prior year reflected a 9.5 benefit from a decrease in the valuation of a contingent earnout liability and 5.4 of gains related to the sale of fixed assets, including land. Operating expenses in Q3 2025 reflected: 
 6.0 of higher employee costs and 
 1.4 of higher variable compensation expense, 
 partially offset by a 4.4 decrease from a divestiture. 
 The investment in our business transformation initiative includes internal resources deployed on the development and configuration of our new ERP system. In Q3 2025, approximately 2 of employee costs were capitalized to Other assets as part of the application-development phase of the project, and we expect to begin amortizing the capitalized development costs in 2026.

 Operating income of 148.6 in year-to-date 2025 represented an improvement of 56.5 compared to operating income of 92.1 in the prior year. The improvement was driven by 31.0 of higher gains on the sale of fixed assets (primarily land), pricing benefits in the Americas and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by 22.5 of higher variable compensation expense and the impacts of lower volume. We reported adjusted operating income of 144.0 and adjusted earnings per share of 0.85 in year-to-date 2025 compared to adjusted operating income of 122.3 and adjusted earnings per share of 0.69 in the prior year. 
 Revenue of 2,378.0 in year-to-date 2025 represented a decline of 6.4 compared to the prior year. The decline was driven by lower volume in International and the impact of a divestiture in the Americas, partially offset by revenue growth in the Americas. Revenue increased by 1 in the Americas driven by large corporate, education and government customers. International revenue decreased by 5 driven by soft demand in most of Western Europe and Asia Pacific, except India. On an organic basis, revenue in year-to-date 2025 represented growth of 1 compared to the prior year, with 3 growth in the Americas but a 5 decline in International. 
 Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue improved by approximately 150 basis points in year-to-date 2025 compared to the prior year. The improvement was driven by pricing benefits in the Americas, favorable business mix from our education business and benefits from cost reduction initiatives, including savings from restructuring actions, partially offset by the impacts of lower volume, 7.5 of higher variable compensation expense 5.6 of which related to the gain on the sale of land). Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue improved by 190 basis points in the Americas but increased by 50 basis points in International. 
 Operating expenses decreased by 16.6 in year-to-date 2025, or 60 basis points as a percentage of revenue, compared to the prior year. Operating expenses in year-to-date 2025 reflected: 
 a 42.1 gain on the sale of land, 
 a 13.0 decrease from a divestiture and 
 approximately 9 of lower spending, primarily in International, 
 partially offset by 15.0 of higher variable compensation expense 8.3 of which related to the gain on the sale of land), 7.9 of higher employee costs, and 4.9 of higher information technology costs primarily related to our business transformation initiative. 
 The investment in our business transformation initiative includes internal resources deployed on the development and configuration of our new ERP system. In year-to-date 2025, approximately 7 of employee costs were capitalized to Other assets as part of the application-development phase of the project, and we expect to begin amortizing the capitalized development costs in 2026. Operating expenses in year-to-date 2024 reflected 10.5 of gains related to the sale of fixed assets, including land, and a 9.5 benefit from a decrease in the valuation of a contingent earnout liability. 
 We recorded restructuring costs of 10.5 in year-to-date 2025 and 18.1 in year-to-date 2024. See Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Our year-to-date 2025 effective tax rate was 26.2 compared to a year-to-date 2024 effective tax rate of approximately 25.7 .

 We recorded restructuring costs of 1.8 in Q3 2025 and 1.6 in Q3 2024. We recorded restructuring costs of 4.3 in year-to-date 2025 and 16.2 in year-to-date 2024. See Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The non-GAAP financial measures used in this MD A are: (1) organic revenue growth (decline), (2) adjusted operating income (loss) and (3) adjusted earnings per share. 
 Organic Revenue Growth (Decline) 
 We define organic revenue growth (decline) as revenue growth (decline) excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency translation effects. Organic revenue growth (decline) is calculated by adjusting prior year revenue to include revenues of acquired companies prior to the date of the company's acquisition, to exclude revenues of divested companies and to use current year average exchange rates in the calculation of foreign-denominated revenue. We believe organic revenue growth (decline) is a meaningful metric to investors as it provides a more consistent comparison of our revenue to prior periods as well as to industry peers. 
 Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings Per Share 
 We define adjusted operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring costs (benefits) and gains (losses) on the sale of land, net of variable compensation impacts. We define adjusted earnings per share as earnings per share, on a diluted basis, excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring costs (benefits), gains (losses) on the sale of land, net of variable compensation impacts, and gains (losses) on pension plan settlements, and the related income tax effects of these items. 
 Amortization of purchased intangible assets: We may record intangible assets (such as backlog, dealer relationships, trademarks, know-how and designs and proprietary technology) when we acquire companies. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to net tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The fair value estimates for these intangible assets require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, which include the useful lives of intangible assets. We believe that adjusting for amortization of purchased intangible assets provides a more consistent comparison of our operating performance to prior periods as well as to industry peers. 
 Restructuring costs (benefits): Restructuring costs (benefits) may be recorded as our business strategies change or in response to changing market trends and economic conditions. We believe that adjusting for restructuring costs (benefits), which are primarily associated with business exit and workforce reduction costs, provides a more consistent comparison of our operating performance to prior periods as well as to industry peers. 
 Gains (losses) on the sale of land, net of variable compensation impacts: We may sell land when conditions are favorable. Gains and losses on the sale of land may increase or decrease, respectively, our variable compensation expense. We believe adjusting for these items provides a more consistent comparison of our operating performance to prior periods as well as to industry peers. In Q2 2025, we began adjusting for these items, as we realized a significant gain on the sale of land during the quarter which had a significant impact on our variable compensation expense, and we have adjusted the prior periods presented for consistency and comparability. 
 Gains (losses) on pension plan settlements : We realize gains or losses previously reported as unrealized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Other income (expense), net , in connection with pension plan settlements when all risks related to the benefit obligations to plan participants and plan assets are transferred. We believe adjusting for the gains or losses on pension plan settlements provides a more consistent comparison of our operating performance to prior periods as well as to industry peers.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are available to fund day-to-day operations, including seasonal disbursements, particularly the annual payment of accrued variable compensation and retirement plan contributions in Q1 of each fiscal year. During normal business conditions, we target a range of 75 to 175 in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments to fund operating requirements. In addition, we may carry additional liquidity for potential investments in strategic initiatives and as a cushion against economic volatility, and from time to time, we may allow our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments to temporarily fall below our targeted range to fund acquisitions, other growth initiatives and material committed cash requirements. 
 Liquidity Sources November 22, 2024 February 23, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents 365.2 318.6 Short-term investments 41.1 Company-owned life insurance 170.3 166.9 Availability under credit facilities 324.1 321.8 Total liquidity sources available 900.7 807.3 
 As of November 22, 2024, we held a total of 406.3 in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Of our total 365.2 in cash and cash equivalents, 87 was located in the U.S. and 13 was located outside of the U.S., primarily in China (including Hong Kong), India and Mexico. Our short-term investments are maintained in a managed investment portfolio in the U.S. and primarily consist of corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities and U.S. government debt securities. 
 COLI investments are recorded at their net cash surrender value. Our investments in COLI policies are intended to be utilized as a funding source for long-term benefit obligations. However, COLI can also be used as a source of liquidity. We believe the financial strength of the issuing insurance companies associated with our COLI policies is sufficient to meet their obligations. 
 Availability under credit facilities may be reduced related to compliance with applicable covenants. See Liquidity Facilities for more information.

 We also have other planned material usages of cash which we consider discretionary. This includes plans for capital expenditures which are expected to total approximately 50 in 2025. We also expect to incur approximately 50 in 2025 of capitalized costs for cloud computing arrangements related to the implementation of our new ERP system. We expect to begin amortizing the capitalized costs incurred in the development of our new ERP system beginning in 2026 when the system is expected to be ready for use. In addition, we fund dividend payments declared by our Board of Directors. On December 18, 2024, we announced a quarterly dividend on our common stock of 0.10 per share, or approximately 11, to be paid in Q4 2025.
