of investment company taxable income, as defined by Subchapter M of the Code, each year. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year; however, the Company will pay a excise tax if it does not distribute at least of the current year s ordinary taxable income. Any such carryover taxable income must be distributed through a dividend declared prior to the later of the date on which the final tax return related to the year in which the Company generated such taxable income is filed or the 15th day of the 10th month following the close of such taxable year. In addition, the Company will be subject to U.S. federal excise tax if it does not distribute at least of its net capital gains realized, computed for any one year period ending October 31. In the future, the SBIC Funds may be limited by provisions of the SBIC Act and SBA regulations governing SBICs from making certain distributions to FIC that may be necessary to enable FIC to make the minimum distributions required to maintain the tax treatment of a RIC. The Company has certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Taxable Subsidiaries that have elected to be treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are thus subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates, each of which generally holds one or more of the Company s portfolio investments listed on the consolidated schedules of investments. The Taxable Subsidiaries are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, such that the Company s consolidated financial statements reflect the Company s investment in the portfolio company investments owned by the Taxable Subsidiaries. The purpose of the Taxable Subsidiaries is to permit the Company to hold equity investments in portfolio companies that are taxed as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (such as entities organized as limited liability companies LLCs or other forms of pass through entities) while complying with the source-of-income requirements contained in the RIC tax provisions. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for U.S. federal corporate income tax purposes, and each Taxable Subsidiary will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its taxable income. Any such income or expense is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. U.S. federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, and as a result, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized under GAAP. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences may arise as a result of, among other items, a difference in the book and tax basis of certain assets and nondeductible U.S. federal income taxes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. ASC Topic 740 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ASC Topic 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC Topic 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be respected by the applicable tax authorities. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense in the current year. It is the Company s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits included in the income tax provision, if any. There were no material uncertain income tax positions at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

Consistent with the policies and methodologies adopted by the Board, the Company performs detailed valuations of its debt and equity investments, including an analysis on the Company s unfunded debt investment commitments, using both the market and income approaches as appropriate. Under the market approach, the Company typically uses the enterprise value methodology to determine the fair value of an investment. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and, in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally best expressed as a range of values, from which the Company derives a single estimate of enterprise value. Under the income approach, the Company typically prepares and analyzes discounted cash flow models to estimate the present value of future cash flows of either an individual debt investment or of the underlying portfolio company itself. The Company evaluates investments in portfolio companies using the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts. The Company also consults with the portfolio company s senior management to obtain further updates on the portfolio company s performance, including information such as industry trends, new product development and other operational issues.

 The significant unobservable input used in determining the fair value under the discounted cash flow technique is the weighted average cost of capital of each security. Significant increases (or decreases) in this input would likely result in significantly lower (or higher) fair value estimates. The significant unobservable inputs used in determining fair value under the enterprise value technique are revenue and EBITDA multiples, as well as asset coverage. Significant increases (or decreases) in these inputs could result in significantly higher (or lower) fair value estimates. Other Financial Assets and Liabilities ASC Topic 820 requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate such value. The Company believes that the carrying amounts of its other financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, interest receivable and accounts payable and other liabilities approximate the fair value of such items due to the short maturity of such instruments. The Company s borrowings under the Credit Facility (as defined in Note 6), the SBA debentures, and the Notes (as defined in Note 6) are recorded at their respective carrying values.

based on the average value of total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The Board accepted a voluntary, non-contractual, and unconditional waiver from the Investment Advisor to exclude any investments recorded as secured borrowings as defined under GAAP from the base management fee payable effective April 1, 2021. See Note 6. Borrowings Secured Borrowings for more information about the secured borrowings. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was and , respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The base management fee waiver for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was and , respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the base management fee payable (net of the base management fee waiver) was and , respectively. The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the quarter. Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (defined below) and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee and excise taxes on realized gains). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as market discount, original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK income, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero-coupon securities), and accrued income the Company has not yet received in cash. The Investment Advisor is not under any obligation to reimburse the Company for any part of the incentive fee it receives that was based on accrued interest that the Company never collects. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, taxes associated with such realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that the Company may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where the Company incurs a loss. For example, if the Company generates pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a quarter, the Company will pay the applicable incentive fee even if the Company has incurred a loss in that quarter due to a net loss on investments. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed hurdle rate of per quarter. Under conditions such as the current rising interest rate environment, the Company may be able to invest funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which would increase the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier for the Investment Advisor to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on such net investment income. The Company pays the Investment Advisor an incentive fee with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: 

 30 

FIDUS INVESTMENT CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (in thousands, except shares and per share data) 

 incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate of ; 

 of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than in any calendar quarter. This portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than is referred to as the catch-up provision. The catch-up is meant to provide the Investment Advisor with of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 

 of the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds in any calendar quarter. 

 The sum of the calculations above equals the income incentive fee. The income incentive fee is appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the calendar quarter. The income incentive fee for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was and , respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the income incentive fee payable was and , respectively. The second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains incentive fee that is determined and paid in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals of the net capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year. In determining the capital gains incentive fee to be paid in cash to the Investment Advisor, the Company calculates the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and losses since the Company's IPO on June 24, 2011 (realized capital gains and losses include realized gains and losses on investments, net of income tax provision from realized gains on investments, and realized losses on extinguishment of debt, but excluding income tax (provision) benefit from deemed distribution of long term capital gains), and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation on investments as of the date of the calculation. At the end of the applicable year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee to be paid equals the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains on investments, less cumulative aggregate tax (provision) benefit on realized gains (losses), less cumulative aggregate realized capital losses on investments, less aggregate unrealized capital depreciation on investments, and less cumulative aggregate realized losses on extinguishment of debt. If this number is positive at the end of such year, then the capital gains incentive fee to be paid in cash for such year equals of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid in all prior years. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the capital gains incentive fee payable in cash was and , respectively (as cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and losses on investments exceeded aggregate unrealized capital depreciation on investments plus realized losses on extinguishment of debt as of December 31, 2023). The aggregate amount of capital gains incentive fees paid from the IPO through September 30, 2024 was . In addition, the Company accrues, but does not pay in cash, a capital gains incentive fee in connection with any unrealized capital appreciation on investments, as applicable. If, on a cumulative basis, the sum of (i) net realized gains/(losses) on investments, net of income tax (provision) benefit from realized gains on investments plus (ii) net unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on investments plus (iii) realized losses on extinguishment of debt decreases during a period, the Company will reverse any excess capital gains incentive fee previously accrued such that the amount of capital gains incentive fee accrued is no more than of the sum of (i) net realized gains/(losses) on investments, net of income tax (provision) benefit from realized gains on investments plus (ii) net unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on investments plus (iii) realized losses on extinguishment of debt. The capital gains incentive fee accrued (reversed) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was and , respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the accrued capital gains incentive fee payable was and , respectively. Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will continue in effect from year to year if approved annually by the Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Company s outstanding voting securities, and, in either case, if also approved by a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the Company, as such term is defined under Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the Independent Directors ). The Investment Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by the Investment Advisor and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than days written notice to the other. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, upon days' written notice, by the vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or the vote of the Board.

These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the documents governing the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the Credit Agreement. SBA debentures: The Company uses debenture leverage provided through the SBA to fund a portion of its investment purchases. Under the SBA debenture program, the SBA commits to purchase debentures issued by SBICs; such debentures have -year terms with the entire principal balance due at maturity and are guaranteed by the SBA. Interest on SBA debentures is payable . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were approved and unused SBA debenture commitmen ts. The SBA may limit the amount that may be drawn each year under any SBA debenture commitments, and each issuance of leverage is conditioned on the SBICs full compliance, as determined by the SBA, with the terms and conditions under SBA regulations.

Legal proceedings: In the normal course of business, the Company may be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that are generally incidental to its ongoing operations.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Fidus Investment Corporation s consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. The information contained in this section should also be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Except as otherwise specified, references to we, us, our, Fidus and FIC refer to Fidus Investment Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Forward Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Fidus Investment Corporation, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to: 
 our future operating results; 

changes in the financial and lending markets; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies, including our and their ability to achieve our respective objectives; 

the impact of investments that we expect to make; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; 

an economic downturn and its impacts on the ability of our portfolio companies to operate and the investment opportunities available to us; 

the impact of geopolitical conditions, including the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, and U.S. and China relations, and its impact on financial market volatility, global economic markets, and various sectors, industries and markets for commodities globally; 

the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

our expected financing and investments; 

the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; 

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; 

the ability of the Investment Advisor to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 

the ability of our Investment Advisor to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 

our regulatory structure and tax treatment; 

our ability to operate as a BDC and a RIC and each of the SBIC Funds to operate as an SBIC; 

the timing, form and amount of any dividend distributions; 

the impact of interest rate volatility and the elevated level of inflation on our business and portfolio companies; 

the valuation of any investments in portfolio companies, particularly those having no liquid trading market; and 

our ability to recover unrealized losses. 

These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 
 41 

an economic downturn and significant disruptions to our portfolio companies, including supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, could impair our portfolio companies ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies; 

a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair our lending and investment activities; 

interest rate vo l atility, could adversely affect our results, particularly because we use leverage as part of our investment strategy; 

the elevated level of inflation could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies, which may, in turn, impact the valuation of such portfolio companies; and 

the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in Item 1A. Risk Factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new debt investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in Item 1.A Risk Factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.

Overview 
 General and Corporate Structure 
 We provide customized debt and equity financing solutions to lower middle-market companies, which we define as U.S. based companies having revenues between 10.0 million and 150.0 million. 
 FIC was formed as a Maryland corporation on February 14, 2011. We completed our initial public offering, or IPO, in June 2011. On June 20, 2011, FIC acquired all of the limited partnership interests of Fidus Mezzanine Capital, L.P. ("Fund I") and membership interests of Fidus Mezzanine Capital GP, LLC, its general partner, resulting in Fund I becoming our wholly-owned SBIC subsidiary. Immediately following the acquisition, we and Fund I elected to be treated as business development companies, or BDCs, under the 1940 Act and our investment activities have been managed by Fidus Investment Advisors, LLC, our investment advisor, and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of us. On March 29, 2013, we commenced operations of a second wholly-owned subsidiary, Fidus Mezzanine Capital II, L.P. ("Fund II"). On April 18, 2018, we commenced operations of a third wholly-owned subsidiary, Fund III. On November 28, 2023, we commenced operations of a fourth wholly-owned subsidiary, Fund IV. 
 Fund III and Fund IV received their SBIC licenses on March 21, 2019 and September 30, 2024, respectively. We plan to continue to operate Fund III and Fund IV as SBICs, subject to SBA approval, and to utilize the proceeds of the sale of SBA-guaranteed debentures to enhance returns to our stockholders. Fund I and Fund II completed their wind-down plans, can no longer issue additional SBA debentures, and relinquished their SBIC licenses on March 20, 2020 and March 7, 2024, respectively. We have also made, and continue to make, investments directly through FIC. We believe that utilizing FIC and the SBIC Funds as investment vehicles provides us with access to a broader array of investment opportunities. 
 We have certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Taxable Subsidiaries ), each of which generally holds one or more of our portfolio investments listed on the consolidated schedules of investments, that have elected to be treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are thus subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates. The Taxable Subsidiaries are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, such that our consolidated financial statements reflect our investment in the portfolio company investments owned by the Taxable Subsidiaries. The purpose of the Taxable Subsidiaries is to permit us to hold equity investments in portfolio companies that are taxed as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (such as entities organized as limited liability companies LLCs or other forms of pass through entities) while complying with the source-of-income requirements contained in the RIC tax provisions. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with us for U.S. federal corporate income tax purposes, and each Taxable Subsidiary will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its taxable income. Any such income or expense is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.

Revenues : We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments and dividends, if any, on equity investments. Our debt investments, whether in the form of second lien, subordinated or first lien loans, typically have terms of five to seven years and most bear interest at fixed or variable rates. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we may receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity dates, which may include prepayment penalties. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity may reflect the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, or structuring fees and fees for providing managerial assistance. Debt investment origination fees, OID and market discount or premium, if any, are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts into interest income. We record prepayment penalties on debt investments as fee income when earned. Interest and dividend income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. Interest is accrued daily based on the outstanding principal amount and the contractual terms of the debt investment. Dividend income is recorded as dividends are declared or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution, and is generally recognized when received. Distributions of earnings from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is a distribution of earnings or a return of capital. Distributions of earnings are included in dividend income while a return of capital is recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. Estimates are adjusted as necessary after the relevant tax forms are received from the portfolio company. Debt investments or preferred equity investments (for which we are accruing PIK dividends) are placed on non-accrual status when principal, interest or dividend payments become materially past due, or when there is reasonable doubt that principal, interest or dividends will be collected. Interest and dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as interest or dividend income or may be applied to the investment principal balance based on management s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal, interest or dividends are paid and, in management s judgment, payments are likely to remain current. See Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates Revenue Recognition. 
 We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Expenses : All investment professionals of the Investment Advisor and/or its affiliates, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses allocable to personnel who provide these services to us, are provided and paid for by the Investment Advisor and not by us. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including, without limitation, those relating to: 
 
 organization; 

calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); 

fees and expenses incurred by the Investment Advisor under the Investment Advisory Agreement or payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments, including dead deal costs; 

interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; 

offerings of our common stock and other securities; 

investment advisory fees and management fees; 

administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments under the Administration Agreement between us and the Investment Advisor based upon our allocable portion of the Investment Advisor s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our officers, including our chief compliance officer, our chief financial officer, and their respective staffs); 

transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses; 

federal and state registration fees; 

all costs of registration and listing our shares on any securities exchange;

all other expenses reasonably incurred by us or the Investment Advisor in connection with administering our business. 

Portfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Yield 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we invested 274.2 million and 204.0 million, respectively, in debt and equity investments including eleven and ten new portfolio companies, respectively.

(1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, first lien debt includes unitranche securities, which account for 32.3 and 35.7 of purchases, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, first lien debt includes unitranche securities, which account for 6.3 and 3.9 of repayments, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our investment portfolio totaled 1,090.7 million and consisted of 85 active portfolio companies and five portfolio companies that have sold their underlying operations. As of September 30, 2024, 49 portfolio companies debt investments bore interest at a variable rate, which represented 702.0 million, or 73.2 , of our debt investment portfolio on a fair value basis, and the remainder of our debt investment portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate investments. Overall, the portfolio had net unrealized appreciation of 15.9 million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, our average active portfolio company investment at amortized cost was 12.6 million, which excludes investments in five portfolio companies that have sold their underlying operations. 
 As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of our investment portfolio totaled 957.9 million and consisted of 81 active portfolio companies and one portfolio company that has sold its underlying operations. As of December 31, 2023, 46 portfolio companies debt investments bore interest at a variable rate, which represented 629.3 million, or 75.6 , of our debt investment portfolio on a fair value basis, and the remainder of our debt investment portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate investments. Overall, the portfolio had net unrealized appreciation of 21.3 million as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, our average active portfolio company investment at amortized cost was 11.6 million, which excludes an investment in one portfolio company that has sold its underlying operations. 
 The weighted average yield on debt investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 13.8 and 14.2 , respectively. The weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries fees and expenses. The weighted average yields were computed using the effective interest rates for debt investments at cost including the accretion of OID and debt investment origination fees, but excluding investments on non-accrual status.

 Portfolio Asset Quality 
 In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, the Investment Advisor uses an internally developed investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. We use a five-level numeric rating scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 
 Investment Rating 1 is used for investments that involve the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The portfolio company is performing above expectations, the debt investment is expected to be paid in the near term and the trends and risk factors are favorable, and may include an expected capital gain on the equity investment. 

Investment Rating 2 is used for investments that involve a level of risk similar to the risk at the time of origination. The portfolio company is performing substantially within our expectations and the risk factors are neutral or favorable. Each new portfolio investment enters our portfolio with Investment Rating 2. 

Investment Rating 3 is used for investments performing below expectations and indicates the investment s risk has increased somewhat since origination. The portfolio company requires closer monitoring, but we expect a full return of principal and collection of all interest and/or dividends. 

Investment Rating 4 is used for investments performing materially below expectations and the risk has increased materially since origination. The investment has the potential for some loss of investment return, but we expect no loss of principal. 

Investment Rating 5 is used for investments performing substantially below our expectations and the risks have increased substantially since origination. We expect some loss of principal. 

47 

We also have observed, and continue to observe, supply chain disruptions, labor and resource shortages, commodity inflation, elements of financial market instability (including high interest rates), an uncertain economic outlook for the United States (which may include a recession), and elements of geopolitical instability (including the ongoing war in Ukraine and U.S. and China relations and ongoing conflict in the Middle East). In the event that the U.S. economy enters into a protracted recession, it is possible that the results of certain U.S. middle market companies could experience deterioration. We are closely monitoring the effect of such market volatility may have on our portfolio companies and our investment activities. We also are maintaining close communications with our portfolio companies and have also increased oversight of credits in vulnerable industries to mitigate any decline in loan performance and reduce credit risk. 
 The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at fair value and cost as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions):

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income was 38.4 million, an increase of 4.2 million or 12.3 , from the 34.2 million of total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As reflected in the table above, the increase is primarily attributable to the following: 
 2.6 million increase in total interest income (which includes payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest income) resulting from an increase in average debt investment balances, partially offset by a decrease in weighted average yield on debt investment balances outstanding during 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.

As reflected in the table above, the increase is primarily attributable to the following: 
 12.1 million increase in total interest income (which includes a 1.0 million increase in PIK interest income) resulting from an increase in average debt investment balances, partially offset by a decrease in weighted average yield on debt investment balances outstanding during 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 

1.1 million increase in dividend income due to an increase in distributions received from equity investments, during 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total expenses, including income tax provision, were 17.0 million, a decrease of 0.5 million or (3.2 ), from the 17.5 million of total expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As reflected in the table above, changes across the periods were primarily attributable to the following: 
 0.7 million net increase in base management fee, including the base management fee waiver, due to higher average total assets during 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total expenses, including income tax provision, were 52.7 million, an increase of 7.1 million or 15.5 , from the 45.6 million of total expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As reflected in the table above, changes across periods were primarily attributable to the following: 
 1.3 million increase in interest and financing expenses due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate of our debt outstanding and an increase in average borrowings outstanding during 2024 as compared to 2023. 

1.9 million net increase in base management fee, including the base management fee waiver, due to higher average total assets during 2024 as compared to 2023. 

2.1 million net increase in the income incentive fee due to an increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income during 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 

0.4 million increase in the accrued capital gains incentive fee due to a net 2.2 million increase in net gain on investments and realized losses on extinguishment of debt during 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 

0.5 million increase in professional fees due to increased legal, audit and tax compliance costs during 2024 as compared to 2023. 

0.7 million increase in the income tax provision (benefit) due to an increase in taxable income at the Taxable Subsidiaries during 2024 as compared to 2023. 

Net Investment Income 
 Net investment income increased by 4.7 million, or 28.5 , to 21.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of the 4.2 million increase in total investment income and the 0.5 million decrease in total expenses, including base management fee waiver and income tax provision. 
 Net investment income increased by 7.8 million, or 16.2 , to 56.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of the 14.9 million increase in total investment income, partially offset by the 7.1 million increase in total expenses, including base management fee waiver and income tax provision.

Net Gain (Loss) on Investments 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the total net realized gain/(loss) on investments, before income tax (provision)/benefit, was (0.4) million and 12.2 million, respectively. Income tax (provision) benefit from realized gains on investments was zero and (1.6) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

 As it relates to realization events, we define an 'exit' of a portfolio company as situations where we have completely exited our position in all of the portfolio company's securities and no longer carry the portfolio company on our schedule of investments. We define a 'sale' of a portfolio company, distinguished from an exit, as situations where the underlying operations of a portfolio company have been sold, but where we retain a residual ownership interest in the legacy entity (we generally distinguish these residual portfolio company investments from 'active' portfolio company investments). 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the total net realized gain/(loss) on investments, before income tax (provision)/benefit, was 9.8 and 4.3 million, respectively.

Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting From Operations 
 51 

Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 16.5 million and 24.3 million, respectively, as a result of the events described above. 
 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 60.7 million and 50.7 million, respectively, as a result of the events described above. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 54.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and our net assets totaled 658.8 million. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our Credit Facility, our anticipated access to SBA-guaranteed debentures, and our anticipated cash flows from investments will provide adequate capital resources with which to operate and finance our investment business and make distributions to our stockholders for at least the next 12 months. We intend to generate additional cash primarily from the future offerings of securities (including the ATM Program) and future borrowings, as well as cash flows from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies. On both a short-term and long-term basis, our primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and cash distributions to our stockholders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid 35.0 million of SBA debentures relating to Fund II that would have matured during the period March 1, 2026 through September 1, 2027. Our remaining outstanding SBA debentures begin to mature in 2029 and subsequent years through 2034, which will require repayment on or before the respective maturity dates. In light of current market conditions, we will continually evaluate our overall liquidity position and take proactive steps to maintain that position based on the current circumstances. This Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources section should be read in conjunction with the notes of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Cash Flows 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 64.7 million. During that period, we made payments of 75.8 million of cash for operating activities, which included the funding of 274.2 million of investments that was partially offset by proceeds received from sales and repayments of investments of 154.1 million. During the same period, we repaid SBA debentures of 35.0 million relating to Fund II, received net borrowings of 40.0 million under our Credit Facility, received net proceeds from the ATM Program of approximately 66.3 million, received repayments of 1.9 million on our secured borrowings, paid cash dividends to stockholders of 57.7 million, and made payment of deferred financing costs related to our debt financings of 0.6 million. 
 Capital Resources 
 We anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities on a long-term basis through a combination of additional debt and equity capital. 
 SBA Debentures 
 Fund III and Fund IV are licensed to operate as an SBIC, and have the ability to issue debentures guaranteed by the SBA at favorable interest rates. Under the SBA regulations, an SBIC can have outstanding at any time debentures guaranteed by the SBA in an amount up to twice its regulatory capital. The SBA regulations currently limit the amount that is available to be borrowed by any SBIC and guaranteed by the SBA to 300.0 of an SBIC s regulatory capital or 175.0 million, whichever is less. For two or more SBICs under common control, the maximum amount of outstanding SBA debentures cannot exceed 350.0 million. The SBA may limit the amount that may be drawn each year under the SBA debenture commitments, and each issuance of leverage is conditioned on SBIC's full compliance, as determined by the SBA, with the terms and conditions under SBA regulations. SBA debentures have fixed interest rates that approximate prevailing 10-year Treasury Note rates plus a spread and have a maturity of ten years with interest payable semi-annually. The principal amount of the SBA debentures is not required to be paid before maturity but may be pre-paid at any time. Fund II has completed a wind-down plan, relinquished its SBIC license and can no longer issue additional SBA debentures, effective as of March 7, 2024. Effective September 30, 2024, the SBA approved a new SBIC license for Fund IV. As of September 30, 2024, Fund III and Fund IV had 175.0 million and zero outstanding SBA debentures, respectively. Subject to SBA regulatory requirements and approval of SBA debenture commitments, we may access up to 175.0 million of additional SBA debentures under the SBIC debenture program. For more information on the SBA debentures, please refer to Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

Credit Facility 
 On June 16, 2014, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement" and the senior secured revolving credit facility, the Credit Facility with ING Capital LLC ING ), as the administrative agent, collateral agent, and lender. The Credit Facility is secured by certain portfolio investments held by us, but portfolio investments held by the SBIC Funds are not collateral for the Credit Facility. On April 24, 2019, we entered into an Amended Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement among us, as borrower, the lenders party thereto, and ING, as administrative agent. On June 26, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Amended Credit Agreement that, among other changes, modified certain financial covenants. On August 17, 2022, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Amended Credit Agreement Second Amendment ). The Second Amendment, among other things: (i) changed the underlying benchmark used to compute interest under the Amended Credit Agreement to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR); (ii) reduced the applicable margin from 3.00 to 2.675 on SOFR loans prior to satisfying certain step-down conditions, and from 2.675 to 2.50 after satisfying certain step-down conditions, with commensurate reductions in the applicable margins for base rate loans; (iii) provided for a loan commitment availability period ending on August 17, 2026; (iv) extended the maturity date to August 17, 2027 from April 24, 2023; and (v) amended certain financial covenants, including (a) amending the asset coverage ratio to no less than 1.50 to 1.00 from no less than 2.00 to 1.00 (on a regulatory basis); and (b) requiring the Company to maintain a senior asset coverage ratio of no less than 2.00 to 1.00. On July 25, 2024, the Company entered into an incremental commitment agreement that increased the Credit Facility total commitment from 100.0 million to 140.0 million. 
 We pay a commitment fee that varies depending on the size of the unused portion of the Credit Facility: 2.500 to 2.675 per annum on the unused portion of the Credit Facility at or below 35 of the commitments and 0.50 per annum on any remaining unused portion of the Credit Facility between the total commitments and the 35 minimum utilization. The Credit Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in all of our assets, excluding the assets of our SBIC subsidiaries. 
 Amounts available to borrow under the Credit Facility are subject to a minimum borrowing/collateral base that applies an advance rate to certain investments held by us, excluding investments held by the SBIC Funds. We are subject to limitations with respect to the investments securing the Credit Facility, including, but not limited to, restrictions on sector concentrations, loan size, payment frequency and status and collateral interests, as well as restrictions on portfolio company leverage, which may also affect the borrowing base and therefore amounts available to borrow. 
 We have made customary representations and warranties and we are required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the documents governing the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the Credit Agreement and we had 40.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. 
 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.75 notes due 2026, or the . The total net proceeds to us from the January 2026 Notes, based on a public offering price of 100.00 of par, after deducting underwriting discounts of 2.5 million and offering expenses of 0.4 million, were 122.1 million. We do not intend to list the January 2026 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of the January 2026 Notes was 125.0 million. On October 8, 2021, we closed the offering of million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.50 notes due 2026, or the (collectively with the January 2026 Notes, the Notes ). The total net proceeds to us from the November 2026 Notes, based on a public offering price of 99.996 of par, after deducting underwriting discounts of 2.5 million and offering expenses of 0.3 million, were 122.2 million.

Secured Borrowing 
 As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of secured borrowings totaled 14.0 million and the fair value of the associated loans included in investments was 14.0 million. As of December 31, 2023, carrying value of secured borrowings totaled 15.9 million and the fair value of the associated loans included in investments was 15.8 million. These secured borrowings were created as a result of our completion of partial loan sales of certain unitranche loan assets that did not meet the definition of a participating interest as defined in ASC 860 (see Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies - Partial loan and equity sales for more information). As a result, sale treatment was not permitted and these partial loan sales were treated as secured borrowings. The weighted average interest rate on our secured borrowings was approximately 8.915 and 9.407 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average stated interest rates for our SBA debentures and the Notes were 4.316 and 4.125 , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had 100.0 million of unutilized commitment under our Credit Facility, and we were subject to a 0.696 fee on such amount. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average stated interest rate on total debt outstanding was 4.647 . 
 As a BDC, we are generally required to meet an asset coverage ratio of at least 150.0 (defined as the ratio which the value of our consolidated total assets, less all consolidated liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, bears to the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness), which includes borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future. This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. On April 29, 2019, our Board, including a majority of the non-interested directors, approved a minimum asset coverage ratio of 150 under Sections 18(a)(1) and 18(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, effective as of April 29, 2020. We also have received exemptive relief from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC to allow us to exclude the senior securities issued by the SBIC Funds and any future SBIC subsidiary from the definition of senior securities in the 150 asset coverage requirement applicable to the Company under the 1940 Act, which, in turn, will enable us to fund more investments with debt capital. 
 As a BDC, we are generally not permitted to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of our common stock if the Board, including the independent directors, determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and if our stockholders approve such sale. On June 12, 2024, our stockholders approved a proposal to authorize us to sell or otherwise issue common stock at a price below net asset value per share for a period of one year ending on the earlier of June 12, 2025 or the date of our 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Our stockholders specified that the cumulative number of shares sold pursuant to such authority during such period may not exceed 25.0 of our then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale. 
 Equity ATM Program 
 On November 10, 2022, the Company established the at-the-market program (the ATM Program ), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through Raymond James Associates, Inc. and B. Riley Securities, Inc., each as sales agents, shares of the Company's common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 50.0 million. On August 11, 2023, the Company increased the maximum amount of shares to be sold through the ATM Program to 150.0 million from 50.0 million. On February 29, 2024, the Company increased the maximum amount of shares to be sold through the ATM Program to 300.0 million from 150.0 million. Cumulative to date, the Company has sold 9,364,244 shares of common stock under the ATM Program at a weighted-average price of 19.75, raising 185.0 million of gross proceeds. Net proceeds were 182.5 million after commissions to the sales agents on sales sold. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 115.0 million available under the ATM Program. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 We have an open market stock repurchase program (the Stock Repurchase Program under which we may acquire up to 5.0 million of our outstanding common stock. Under the Stock Repurchase Program, we may, but are not obligated to, repurchase outstanding common stock in the open market from time to time provided that we comply with the prohibitions under our insider trading policies and the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including certain price, market value and timing constraints. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by our management, in its discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, capital availability, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations. Most recently, on October 28, 2024, the Board extended the Stock Repurchase Program through December 31, 2025, or until the approved dollar amount has been used to repurchase shares. The Stock Repurchase Program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares and we cannot assure that any shares will be repurchased under the Stock Repurchase Program. The Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. We did not make any repurchases of common stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning stock repurchases.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting amounts reported in the financial statements. We have identified investment valuation, revenue recognition and transfers of financial assets as our most critical accounting policies and estimates. We continuously evaluate our policies and estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies relating to investment valuations and transfers of financial assets are set forth below. See Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our critical accounting policies relating to revenue recognition. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 As a BDC, we report our assets and liabilities at fair value at all times consistent with GAAP and the 1940 Act. Accordingly, we are required to periodically determine the fair value of all of our portfolio investments. 
 Our investments generally consist of illiquid securities including debt and equity investments in lower middle-market companies. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for substantially all of the investments in our portfolio, we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market quotation, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market quotation existed for such investments, and the difference could be material. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals of the Investment Advisor responsible for the portfolio investment; 

preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the investment committee of the Investment Advisor; 

our board of directors engages one or more independent valuation firm(s) to conduct independent appraisals of a selection of our portfolio investments for which market quotations are not readily available. Each portfolio company investment is generally appraised by the valuation firm(s) at least once every calendar year and each new portfolio company investment is appraised at least once in the twelve-month period following the initial investment. In certain instances, we may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result it is not in our stockholders best interest, to request the independent appraisal of certain portfolio company investments. Such instances include, but are not limited to, situations where we determine that the fair value of the portfolio company investment is relatively insignificant to the fair value of the total portfolio; 

the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of the Investment Advisor and of the independent valuation firm(s) and responds and supplements the valuation recommendations to reflect any comments; and 

our board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of the Investment Advisor, the independent valuation firm(s) and the audit committee. 

In making the good faith determination of the value of portfolio investments, the Board starts with the cost basis of the security. The transaction price is typically the best estimate of fair value at inception. When evidence supports a subsequent change to the carrying value from the original transaction price, adjustments are made to reflect the expected exit values. 
 Our Board consulted with the independent third-party valuation firm(s) in arriving at our determination of fair value for 18 and 18 of our portfolio company investments representing 27.7 and 29.9 of the total portfolio investments at fair value (exclusive of new portfolio company investments made during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Consistent with the policies and methodologies adopted by the Board, we perform detailed valuations of our debt and equity investments, including an analysis on the Company's unfunded debt investment commitments, using both the market and income approaches as appropriate. Under the market approach, we typically use the enterprise value methodology to determine the fair value of an investment. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and, in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally best expressed as a range of values, from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value. Under the income approach, we typically prepare and analyze discounted cash flow models to estimate the present value of future cash flows of either an individual debt investment or of the underlying portfolio company itself. 
 55 

We evaluate investments in portfolio companies using the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts. We also consult with the portfolio company s senior management to obtain further updates on the portfolio company s performance, including information such as industry trends, new product development and other operational issues. 
 For our debt investments, the primary valuation technique used to estimate the fair value is the discounted cash flow method. However, if there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt investment is in workout status, we may consider other methods in determining the fair value, including the value attributable to the debt investment from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis. Our discounted cash flow models estimate a range of fair values by applying an appropriate discount rate to the future cash flow streams of our debt investments, based on future interest and principal payments as set forth in the associated debt investment agreements. We prepare a weighted average cost of capital for use in the discounted cash flow model for each investment, based on factors including, but not limited to: current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed or executed investment transactions of private companies; the portfolio company s historical financial results and outlook; and the portfolio company s current leverage and credit quality as compared to leverage and credit quality as of the date the investment was made. We may also consider the following factors when determining the fair value of debt investments: the portfolio company s ability to make future scheduled payments; prepayment penalties and other fees; estimated remaining life; the nature and realizable value of any collateral securing such debt investment; and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that generally may affect the price at which similar investments may be made. We estimate the remaining life of our debt investments to generally be the legal maturity date of the instrument, as we generally intend to hold debt investments to maturity. However, if we have information available to us that the debt investment is expected to be repaid in the near term, we would use an estimated remaining life based on the expected repayment date. 
 For our equity investments, including equity securities and warrants, we generally use a market approach, including valuation methodologies consistent with industry practice, to estimate the enterprise value of portfolio companies. Typically, the enterprise value of a private company is based on multiples of EBITDA, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company, we analyze various factors consistent with industry practice, including but not limited to original transaction multiples, the portfolio company s historical and projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public. 
 We may also utilize an income approach when estimating the fair value of our equity investments, either as a primary methodology if consistent with industry practice or if the market approach is otherwise not applicable, or as a supporting methodology to corroborate the fair value ranges determined by the market approach. We typically prepare and analyze discounted cash flow models based on projections of the future free cash flows (or earnings) of the portfolio company. We consider various factors, including but not limited to the portfolio company s projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public. 
 Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainties with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any changes in such valuations, on the consolidated financial statements. 
 Transfers of Financial Assets 
 Partial loan and equity sales. We follow the guidance in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, when accounting for loan (debt investment) participations, equity assignments and other partial loan sales. Such guidance requires a participation, assignment or other partial loan or equity sale to meet the definition of a participating interest, as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations, assignments or other partial loan or equity sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest should remain on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and the proceeds recorded as a secured borrowing until the definition is met. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standard 
 In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740), which requires disclosure of additional information pertaining to income taxes. Such changes include disclosing i) a reconciliation of the effective tax rate to statutory rate for federal, state, and foreign income taxes and ii) taxes paid (net of refunds received) should be disaggregated for federal, state and foreign taxes. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our consolidated financial position or disclosures, but we do not expect the impact to be material. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 56 

We have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with Fidus Investment Advisors as our investment advisor. Pursuant to the agreement, the Investment Advisor manages our day-to-day operating and investing activities. We pay the Investment Advisor a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components a base management fee and an incentive fee. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. The Investment Advisor, in consultation with the Board, agreed to voluntarily waive 0.1 million and 0.2 million of the base management fees on any assets accounted for as secured borrowings as defined under GAAP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 0.1 million and 0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Fidus Group Holdings, LLC Holdings ), a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware, is the parent company of Fidus Investment Advisors. Edward H. Ross, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Thomas C. Lauer, our President, are managers of Holdings. 

We entered into the Administration Agreement with Fidus Investment Advisors to provide us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. 

We entered into a license agreement with Fidus Partners, LLC, pursuant to which Fidus Partners, LLC has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Fidus. 

In connection with the IPO and our election to be regulated as a BDC, we applied for and received exemptive relief from the SEC on March 27, 2012 to allow us to take certain actions that would otherwise be prohibited by the 1940 Act, as applicable to BDCs. Effective June 30, 2014, pursuant to exemptive relief from the SEC, we are permitted to exclude the senior securities issued by the SBIC Funds and any future SBIC subsidiary from the definition of senior securities in the asset coverage requirement applicable to the Company under the 1940 Act. 
 While we may co-invest with investment entities managed by the Investment Advisor or its affiliates, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, the 1940 Act imposes significant limits on co-investment. On January 4, 2017, the SEC staff has granted us relief sought in an exemptive order that expands our ability to co-invest in portfolio companies with other funds managed by the Investment Advisor or its affiliates ("Affiliated Funds") in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions (the Order ). Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Independent Directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies. However, neither we nor our affiliates are obligated to invest or co-invest when investment opportunities are referred to us or them. 
 In addition, we and our Investment Advisor have each adopted a joint code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that governs the conduct of our and the Investment Advisor s officers, directors and employees. Additionally, the Investment Advisor has adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and in accordance with Rule 17j-1(c) under the 1940 Act. We have also adopted a code of business conduct that is applicable to all officers, directors and employees of Fidus and our Investment Advisor. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the Maryland General Corporation Law.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect both our cost of funding and the valuation of our investment portfolio. Uncertainty with respect to elevated interest rates, inflationary pressures, the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East and the failure of financial institutions introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effects of this volatility has materially impacted and could continue to materially impact our market risks. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs. The prices of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the companies in which we invest and conditions affecting the general economy, including: overall market changes, including an increase in market volatility; legislative reform; local, regional, national or global political, social or economic instability; and interest rate volatility. 
 In the future, our investment income may also be affected by changes in various interest rates, including SOFR and prime rates, to the extent of any debt investments that include floating interest rates. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has been rapidly raising interest rates bringing it up to 5.25 to 5.50 range. The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate in the third quarter to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 . Although the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate for the first time since March 2020 and indicated there may be additional rate cuts in 2024, future reductions to the benchmark rates are not certain. In a high interest rate environment, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. It is possible that the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle could result the United States into a recession, which would likely decrease interest rates. Conversely, a prolonged reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in base rates, such as SOFR are not offset by a corresponding increase in the spread over such base rate that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in in our operating expenses, including with respect to our income incentive fee, or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities tied to such base rate. See Risk Factors contained herein under Part II, Item 1A and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, such as "Changes in interest rates will affect our cost of capital and net investment income and Inflation may adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies, which may, in turn, impact the valuation of such portfolio companies. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the debt investments in 49 and 46 portfolio companies, respectively, bore interest at a variable rate, which represented 702.0 million, or 73.2 , and 629.3 million, or 75.6 , of our portfolio on a fair value basis, respectively, and the remainder of our debt portfolio was comprised entirely of fixed rate investments. Our pooled SBA debentures and our Notes bear interest at fixed rates. Our Credit Facility bears interest, at our election, at a rate per annum equal to (a) 2.675 on SOFR loans prior to satisfying certain step-down conditions (or 2.50 after satisfying certain step-down conditions, with commensurate reductions in the applicable margins for base rate loans). We pay a commitment fee that varies depending on the size of the unused portion of the Credit Facility: 2.500 to 2.675 per annum on the unused portion of the Credit Facility at or below 35 of the commitments and 0.50 per annum on any remaining unused portion of the Credit Facility between the total commitments and the 35 minimum utilization. The Credit Agreement relating to the Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a minimum asset coverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00 (on a regulatory basis) and a senior asset coverage ratio of no less than 2.00 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2024, the Credit Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in all of our assets, excluding the assets of the SBIC Funds. 
 
 Because we currently borrow, and plan to borrow in the future, money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 
 The following table shows the approximate annualized increase or decrease in the components of net investment income due to hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, assuming no changes in our investments and borrowings as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in millions):

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by our management, in its discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, capital availability, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations. Most recently, on October 28, 2024, the Board extended the Stock Repurchase Program through December 31, 2025, or until the approved dollar amount has been used to repurchase shares. The Stock Repurchase Program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares and we cannot assure that any shares will be repurchased under the Stock Repurchase Program. The Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time.
