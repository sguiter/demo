 (dollar and share amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified) 

We have reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements and have concluded that, other than as described above, they are either not applicable to us or are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

of the outstanding shares of GKE GmbH and SAL GmbH effective October 16, 2023, and upon approval by applicable Chinese regulators, effective December 31, 2023, we acquired of the outstanding shares of Beijing GKE Science Technology Co. Ltd. GKE China and together with GKE GmbH and SAL GmbH, GKE or the "GKE acquisition"). 
 
 GKE develops, manufactures and sells a highly competitive portfolio of chemical sterilization indicators, biologics, and process challenge devices to protect patient safety across global healthcare markets. GKE is included in our Sterilization and Disinfection Control ("SDC") division, and GKE's strengths in chemical indictors are complementary to SDC's strengths in biologic indicators as chemical and biologic indicators are used in the same sterility validation workflows. Additionally, GKE s healthcare-focused commercial capabilities in Europe and Asia greatly expand our reach in the healthcare markets in those geographies. We are working to obtain regulatory 510 (k) clearance on certain GKE products for sale in the United States, which would further expand organic revenues growth opportunities from the GKE business. 
 
 We finalized our purchase price accounting of GKE during fiscal year 2024. Total cash consideration for the GKE acquisition was , net of cash and financial liabilities acquired and inclusive of working capital adjustments. Of the total acquisition price, approximately (at September 30, 2024 exchange rates) is being held back until April 2025 in accordance with the purchase agreement as security against potential indemnification losses ("GKE holdback"). We funded the acquisition through a combination of cash on-hand and a total of borrowed under our line of credit. 
 
 During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , GKE's operations contributed the following amounts to our consolidated results of operations: 

Gross profit 
 
 Amortization of inventory step-up recorded in cost of revenues 
 Amortization of acquired intangibles recorded in cost of revenues 
 Amortization of acquired intangibles recorded in general and administrative expense

 Other 
 Total revenues 

Other than China, no foreign country exceeded 10 of total revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 
 
 Contract Balances 
 Our contracts have varying payment terms and conditions. Some customers prepay for products and services, resulting in unearned revenues or customer deposits, called contract liabilities. Short-term contract liabilities are included within unearned revenues in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and long-term contract liabilities are included within other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The significant majority of our revenues and related receivables and contract liabilities are generated from contracts with customers with original durations of 12 months or less. Contract liabilities will be recognized to revenue as we satisfy our obligations under the terms of the contracts. 
 
 A summary of contract liabilities is as follows: 

Prior year liabilities recognized in revenues during the six months ended September 30, 2024 
 Contract liabilities added during the six months ended September 30, 2024, net of revenues recognized 
 Contract liabilities as of September 30, 2024 

convertible senior notes due August 15, 2025 the "Notes"), through which we repurchased in aggregate principal amount of the Notes. See Note 7. "Indebtedness" for further information. As of September 30, 2024 , we had remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes. We estimate the fair value of the Notes using Level 2 inputs based on the last actively traded price or observable market input preceding the end of the reporting period. The fair value of the Notes is approximately correlated to our stock price. 
 
 The estimated fair value and carrying value of the Notes were as follows: 

The carrying amount of the term loan and revolving line of credit (together, the "Credit Facility") on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates fair value due to the variable interest rate pricing on the debt with the balance bearing an interest rate approximating current market rates. 
 
 We expect to pay approximately (at September 30, 2024 exchange rates) for the GKE holdback in April 2025. We estimate the discounted fair value of consideration held back to be approximately as of September 30, 2024 based on Level 3 inputs from the acquisition, including discount rate estimates. We adjust the estimated fair value at each reporting period through earnings. 
 
 During fiscal year 2023, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Belyntic GmbH s peptide purification business the Belyntic acquisition ). The Belyntic acquisition obligates us to pay contingent consideration of up to cash upon regulatory approval of certain patent applications (see Note 11. "Commitments and Contingencies"), of which has not yet been paid. We estimate the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration is , using Level 3 inputs and a probability-weighted outcome analysis based on our expectations of patent approval, leveraging our historical experience and expert input. 
 
 Amounts recognized or disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis include the initial recognition and disclosure of most assets and liabilities purchased in business acquisitions and any related measurement period adjustments. Additionally, assets such as property and equipment, operating lease assets, goodwill and other intangible assets are adjusted to fair value if determined to be impaired. Fair values of such assets and liabilities require measurement using Level 3 inputs. We recorded no impairments during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 . 
 
 There were no transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the three months ended three and six months ended September 30, 2024 .

 Other noncurrent liabilities consisted of the following: 

Noncurrent acquisition-related holdbacks

 Total other noncurrent liabilities 

The increase in operating lease liabilities is primarily attributable to new a new right-of-use leased facility associated with the manufacturing and administrative office facilities used by our Biopharmaceutical Development division in Uppsala, Sweden.

(the "Revolver"), 2 a swingline loan with an aggregate principal amount not exceeding , and 3 letters of credit with an aggregate stated amount not exceeding at any time. The agreement also provided for an incremental term loan or an increase in revolving commitments with a minimum aggregate principal amount of and a maximum amount of , subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and lender considerations. We refer to the agreement in whole as the Credit Facility. 
 
 On October 5, 2023, we amended the terms of the Credit Facility to increase the maximum principal amount available to us under the Revolver from to . 
 
 On April 5, 2024, we further amended and restated the terms of the Credit Facility to: 
 
 (i) Extend the maturity of the Credit Facility to April 2029; 
 (ii) Allow proceeds from the Credit Facility to be used to redeem some or all of the Company s 2025 Notes; 
 (iii) Include a 75,000 senior secured term loan facility (the Term Loan ), which is subject to principal amortization payments; and 
 (iv) Make certain changes to the financial covenants. 

In conjunction with the amendment and restatement of the Credit Facility during the six months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred of customary lender fees and debt issuance costs paid to third parties, of which is related to the Revolver and is related to the Term Loan. The fees are being amortized to interest expense through maturity. 
 
 Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility bear interest at either a base rate or a SOFR rate plus an applicable spread ranging from to , depending on our total net leverage ratio. The interest rate on borrowings under our line of credit as of September 30, 2024 was . 
 
 The financial covenants in the Credit Facility as amended include a maximum leverage ratio of to 1.00 for the first five testing dates on which amounts under the Revolver are outstanding; to 1.0 on each of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth testing dates; and to 1.0 on each testing date following the ninth testing date. The Credit Facility also stipulates a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to 1.0 and a minimum senior net leverage ratio of to 1. Other covenants include restrictions on our ability to incur debt, grant liens, make fundamental changes to our business as defined in the contract, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, or conduct asset sales. As of September 30, 2024 , we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility. 
 
 Term Loan 
 We borrowed under the Term Loan on April 5, 2024, to fund the privately negotiated repurchases of a portion of the Notes (see Convertible Notes below). During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , we made required quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan of and , respectively. 
 
 We are required to make quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan. For the following fiscal years ending March 31, debt payments on the Term Loan are required as follows: 

2026 
 2027 
 2028 
 2029 
 Thereafter 
 Total Principal Remaining 

The net carrying amount of the Term Loan was as follows: 

Less: discount and debt issuance costs 
 Less: current portion 
 Noncurrent portion 

The effective interest rate on the Term Loan at the time of borrowing was . 

Revolver 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the outstanding balance under the Revolver was and was available for borrowing. Subsequent to September 30, 2024 , we repaid an additional on the Revolver. 
 
 We are obligated to pay quarterly unused commitment fees of between and of the Revolver s aggregate principal amount, based on our leverage ratio. 
 
 The balance of unamortized customary lender fees related to the Revolver, including fees from the original debt issuance and all subsequent amendments and restatements, was and as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Convert ible Notes 
 On August 12, 2019, we issued an aggregate principal amount of of Notes. The net proceeds from the Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other related offering expenses payable by us, were approximately . The Notes mature on August 15, 2025, unless earlier repurchased or converted, and bear interest at a rate of payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 each year. The Notes are initially convertible, subject to certain conditions, at a conversion rate of shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock. 
 
 On April 5, 2024, we entered into separate, privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the Notes to repurchase aggregate principal amount of the Notes for an aggregate repurchase price of in cash, plus accrued and unpaid interest of . We accounted for the partial repurchase of the Notes as a debt extinguishment, which resulted in the recognition of a gain on extinguishment of in other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the six months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 , in aggregate principal amount of the Notes remained outstanding, which we intend to pay using a combination of cash on hand and a draw on our Revolver. 
 
 Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. The circumstances necessary for conversion were not met during the three or six months ended September 30, 2024 . The Notes will become convertible at any time from, and including, April 15, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. As of September 30, 2024 , the Notes were classified as a current liability on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The if-converted value of the Notes did not exceed the principal balance as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 The net carrying amount of the Notes was as follows: 

Unamortized debt issuance costs

 The following is a summary of RSU and PSU award activity for the six months ended September 30, 2024 : 

Awards granted (1) 
 Awards forfeited 
 Awards distributed 
 Outstanding as of September 30, 2024 

1 Balances for PSUs granted are reflected at target. 

Outstanding time-based RSUs vest and settle in shares of our common stock on a one -for- one basis. The majority of RSUs granted to employees during the six months ended September 30, 2024 vest in equal installments on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the grant date. RSUs granted to non-employee directors during the six months ended September 30, 2024 vest one year from the grant date. We generally recognize the expense relating to RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 
 
 We grant PSUs to certain key employees. The number of shares earned is determined at the end of each performance period based on Mesa's achievement of certain pre-defined targets per the related award agreement. The outstanding PSUs vest upon completion of the service period described in the award agreement. We recognize the expense relating to the performance-based RSUs based on the probable outcome of achievement of the performance targets on a straight-line basis over the service period. 
 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors created a plan to award PSUs at target the FY25 PSUs to eligible employees. Of the PSUs granted, PSUs have a grant date fair value of and are subject to service and company financial performance conditions. The financial performance measurement period is from April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2027. The remaining PSUs have a grant date fair value of and are subject to service and market conditions, with the market performance period measured from June 18, 2024 through June 18, 2027. The service period for all of the FY25 PSUs is from June 18, 2024 through June 18, 2027. The quantity of shares that will be earned based upon either company financial performance or market performance will range from to of the targeted number of shares if the defined minimum targets are not met, then no shares will vest. 
 
 The following is a summary of stock option award activity for the six months ended September 30, 2024 : 

Awards granted 
 Awards forfeited or expired 
 Awards exercised 
 Outstanding as of September 30, 2024 

Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock 
 Dilutive effect of RSUs 
 Fully diluted shares 
 
 Basic earnings (loss) per share 
 Diluted earnings (loss) per share 

Potentially dilutive securities include stock options and both time and performance based RSUs (collectively "stock awards"), as well as common shares underlying our Notes. Stock awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS if they are subject to performance conditions that have not yet been achieved or if they are antidilutive. Diluted EPS does not consider the impact of potentially dilutive securities in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potential common shares would have an antidilutive effect in such cases. 
 
 The following stock awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS: 

Stock awards that were anti-dilutive 
 Total stock awards excluded from diluted EPS 

Shares underlying the Notes were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as the impact of the assumed conversion of the Notes calculated under the if-converted method was antidilutive. The decrease in assumed conversion of the Notes is related to the partial repayment of the Notes that occurred during the six months ended September 30, 2024 (see Note 7. "Indebtedness"). 

Effective tax rate 

For interim income tax reporting, we estimate our annual effective tax rate and apply this effective tax rate to our year-to-date pre-tax income. Each quarter, our estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if the estimated effective tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made. Additionally, the tax effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring items are recognized as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. There is a potential for volatility in the effective tax rate due to several factors, including changes in the mix of the pre-tax income and the jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in tax laws and foreign tax holidays, settlement with taxing authorities, and foreign currency fluctuations. 
 
 The change in the effective tax rate for both the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods is primary due to the valuation allowance established on the US deferred taxes during fiscal year 2024. The effective tax rate for both the three and the six months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the statutory federal rate of primarily due to the valuation allowance established on the US deferred taxes during fiscal year 2024. 

(at September 30, 2024 exchange rates) for the GKE holdback in April 2025, pending adjustments for potential indemnification losses that may arise. The liability is recorded at its discounted fair value of in other accrued expenses on our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 As part of the Belyntic acquisition, we agreed to pay the sellers a contingency based upon approval of contractually specified patents. The estimated fair value of the probable remaining contingent consideration was as of September 30, 2024 .

 Overview 
 
 We are a global leader in the design and manufacture of life sciences tools and critical quality control solutions for regulated applications in the pharmaceutical, healthcare, and medical device industries. We offer products and services to help our customers ensure product integrity, increase patient and worker safety, and improve the quality of life throughout the world. We have manufacturing operations in the United States and Europe, and our products are marketed by our sales personnel in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, and by independent distributors in these areas as well as throughout the rest of the world. We prefer markets in which we can establish a strong presence and achieve high gross profit margins. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we managed our operations in four reportable segments, or divisions: Sterilization and Disinfection Control, Clinical Genomics, Biopharmaceutical Development, and Calibration Solutions. Each of our divisions is described further in "Results of Operations" below. Unallocated corporate expenses and other business activities are reported within Corporate and Other. 
 
 Corporate Strategy 
 We strive to create stakeholder value and further our purpose of Protecting the Vulnerable by growing our business both organically and through acquisitions, by improving our operating efficiency, and by continuing to hire, develop and retain top talent. As a business, we commit to our purpose of Protecting the Vulnerable every day by taking a customer-focused approach to developing, building, and delivering our products. We serve a broad set of industries, in particular the pharmaceutical, healthcare services, and medical device verticals, in which the safety, quality, and efficacy of products is critical, by delivering the highest quality products possible. We are committed to protecting the communities we serve. 
 
 Organic Revenues Growth 
 Organic revenues growth is driven by the expansion of our customer base, increases in sales volumes, new product offerings, and price increases, and may be affected positively or negatively by changes in foreign currency rates. Our ability to increase organic revenues is affected by general economic conditions, both domestic and international, customer capital spending trends, competition, and the introduction of new products. Our policy is to price our products competitively and, where possible, we pass along cost increases to our customers in order to maintain our margins. We typically evaluate costs and pricing annually, with price increases effective January 1. 
 
 Inorganic Growth - Acquisitions 
 Over the past decade, we have consummated a number of acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our product offerings and the industries we serve, globalize our company, and increase the scale at which we operate. In turn, this growth affords us the ability to improve our operating efficiency, extend our customer base, and further the pursuit of our purpose: Protecting the Vulnerable . 
 
 Improving Our Operating Efficiency 
 Our ongoing goal is to maximize value in our existing businesses and those we acquire by implementing efficiencies in our manufacturing, commercial, engineering, and administrative operations. We achieve efficiencies using the four pillars that make up the Mesa Way , which is our customer-centric, lean-based system for continuously improving and operating the manufacturing and administrative aspects of our high-margin, niche businesses. The Mesa Way is focused on: "Measuring What Matters" using our customers' perspective and setting high standards for performance; "Empowering Teams" to improve operationally and exceed customer expectations; "Sustainably Improving" using lean-based tools designed to help us identify and prioritize the biggest opportunities; and "Always Learning" so that performance continuously improves.

Gross profit is affected by many factors including our product mix, foreign currency rates, manufacturing efficiencies, costs of products and labor, and price competition. Historically, as we have integrated our acquisitions and taken advantage of manufacturing efficiencies, our gross profit percentages for some products have improved. There are, however, differences in gross profit percentages between product lines, and ultimately our mix of revenues will continue to impact our overall gross profit. 
 
 Hire, Develop, and Retain Top Talent 
 At the center of our organization are talented people who are capable of taking on new challenges using a team approach. Indeed, it is our exceptionally talented workforce that works together and uses our lean-based tool set to find ways to continuously and sustainably improve our products, our services, and ourselves, resulting in long-term value creation for our stakeholders. 
 
 General Trends 
 We are a global company with multinational operations. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 53 of our revenues were earned outside of the United States. We face both opportunities and challenges resulting from our geographic and industry diversity, such as varied economic environments across served geographies, technology changes in served markets, opportunities in high-growth markets, the impact of foreign currency movements against the U.S. dollar ("USD"), changes in trends and costs of a global labor force, and increasing regulation. Continued growth of our revenue will depend on our ability to (i) continue commercial efforts to expand business with new and existing customers, (ii) identify, consummate, and integrate acquisitions successfully, and (iii) develop or purchase differentiated products and services. We maintain our profitability by improving the effectiveness of our sales forces, continuing to pursue cost reduction initiatives, and improving our operating efficiency. 
 
 During the first half of fiscal year 2025, our revenues increased 11.7 , versus the comparable prior year period, primarily driven by revenues of 12,117 from GKE, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Organic revenues increased 0.1 during the first half of fiscal year 2025 primarily as a result of 25.0 organic revenues growth from our Biopharmaceutical Development division, and to a lesser extent organic revenues increases of 5.6 from our Calibration Solutions division. Our Biopharmaceutical Development division, in particular, benefited from an improved environment for capital equipment purchases in the biopharmaceutical vertical. Organic revenues in our Clinical Genomics business declined 20.8 as we continue to experience challenges from the economic slowdown in China and regulatory challenges that are impacting sales of new Clinical Genomics instruments in the United States. However, the Clinical Genomics division's revenues have increased sequentially in both the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2025. 
 
 Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 1.7 percentage points in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024, primarily attributable to lower amortization of intangible expenses flowing through cost of revenues as a result of the Clinical Genomics intangible asset impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 and margin contribution of 62.3 from the GKE acquisition, including 1,232 of non-cash inventory step up amortization. 
 
 Operating expenses declined slightly during the first half of fiscal year 2025 versus the comparable prior year period, despite an 11.7 increase in revenues. Operating expenses incurred by GKE during the six months ended September 30, 2024 were offset by lower amortization expense as we impaired a portion of the intangible assets held by the Clinical Genomics division in fiscal year 2024. The weakening of the USD increased reported expenses incurred in Europe, but despite foreign currency headwinds, operating income was 9,088, an increase of 9,812 versus the comparable prior year period. Additionally, we recorded about 900 more for bonuses in the first six months of fiscal year 2025 versus the comparable prior year period due to improved performance. GKE contributed 4,533 to our consolidated operating income during the first half of fiscal year 2025. 
 
 A weakening or strengthening of foreign currencies against the USD increases or decreases our reported revenues, gross profit margins, and operating expenses, and impacts the comparability of our results between periods.

The Sterilization and Disinfection Control division's revenues increased 30.0 and 36.8 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively versus the comparable prior year periods. The GKE acquisition contributed inorganic revenues of 5,863 and 12,117 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Organic revenues declined 4.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased 0.1 for the six months ended September 30, 2024. Strong commercial execution that resulted in organic revenues growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and significant orders growth of 6 in the first half of the fiscal year excluding GKE was largely offset by lower than expected order fulfillments. However, the past due backlog for the division has increased and is expected to be fulfilled over the next two quarters. We anticipate positive organic revenues growth in the Sterilization and Disinfection Control division in fiscal year 2025. 
 
 The Sterilization and Disinfection Control division's gross profit percentage decreased 4.7 percentage points and 4.9 percentage points for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the comparable prior year periods. The three and six months ended September 30, 2024 includes 588 and 1,476, respectively, of both amortization of GKE s intangible assets and amortization of non-cash inventory step-up, which affect the comparability of gross margins as a percentage of revenues. There will be no further charges for the inventory step up. Excluding these non-cash charges from purchase accounting, the Sterilization and Disinfection Control division s margin decreased 2.1 percentage points and 1.6 percentage points for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, when the inventory step up is no longer being amortized through cost of revenues, we expect GKE's gross profit percentage will be in the low 70s. 
 
 Clinical Genomics 
 The Clinical Genomics division develops, manufactures and sells highly sensitive, low-cost, high-throughput genetic analysis tools and related consumables and services that enable clinical research labs and contract research organizations to perform genomic testing for a broad range of research applications in several therapeutic areas, such as screenings for hereditary diseases, pharmacogenetics, oncology related applications, and toxicology research.

The Clinical Genomics division's revenues decreased 26.0 and 20.8 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 versus the comparable prior year periods. The decrease for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to decreases in revenues from consumables, and to a lesser extent, new systems in China as a result of China's economic slowdown and anti-corruption initiatives, which began to significantly impact us during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Decreased instrument sales in the United States due to increased regulation of lab-developed tests further contributed to decreased revenues. 
 
 Gross profit percentage for the Clinical Genomics division increased 1.7 and 4.1 percentage points for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 versus the comparable prior year periods, primarily due to lower intangibles amortization expense as a result of an impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Excluding the impact of amortization expense, gross profit as a percentage of revenues would have decreased 5.8 and 4.0 percentage points for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily as a result of lower revenues on a partially fixed cost base as well as realizing lower margins on certain strategic instrument sales into our APAC region that we expect will increase our consumables sales in the future. 
 
 Biopharmaceutical Development 
 Our Biopharmaceutical Development division develops, manufactures, and sells automated systems for protein analysis (immunoassays) and peptide synthesis solutions. Immunoassays and peptide synthesis solutions accelerate the discovery, development, and manufacture of biotherapeutic therapies, among other applications.

The Calibration Solutions division's revenues increased 8.2 and 5.6 , respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 versus the comparable prior year period, primarily due to commercial efforts and increases in prices, particularly in our Renal Care product lines. 
 
 The Calibration Solutions division's gross profit percentage increased 2.2 and 3.8 percentage points for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the comparable prior year period, primarily due to increased revenues on a partially-fixed cost base and favorable product mix. 
 
 Operating Expense 
 
 Operating expense decreased 0.7 and 0.6 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the comparable prior year period. Increases in operating expenses from GKE's operations were offset by lower amortization of intangible assets as a result of the Clinical Genomics impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. 
 
 Selling Expense 
 Selling expense is driven primarily by labor costs, including salaries and commissions; accordingly, it may vary with sales levels.

General and administrative expenses decreased 0.4 and 3.7 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the comparable prior year period, largely due to the decrease of amortization of intangible assets due to an impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Excluding amortization expense, general and administrative expense would have increased 12.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of GKE's general and administrative expenses as well as higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Excluding amortization expense, for the six months ended September 30, 2024, general administrative costs would have increased 9.4 , primarily as a result of general and administrative costs from GKE and costs associated with integrating GKE into our enterprise resource planning tool. 
 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development expense is predominantly comprised of labor costs and costs of third-party consultants.

Research and development expenses decreased 7.2 and 4.4 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the comparable prior year periods. We undertook cost containment efforts during fiscal year 2024, which included recording severance. Lower costs in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 were a result of lower headcount, no severance charges, and reduced research and development supplies purchases.

Nonoperating expense, net for the six months ended September 30, 2024 is composed primarily of a 3,197 gain recorded related to the partial extinguishment of the Notes during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. The gain represents the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the Notes and any unamortized debt issuance costs at the time of settlement. The gain on the extinguishment was offset by the combination of interest expense and debt issuance costs, and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. 
 
 We incurred significantly more interest expense during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 versus the comparable prior year period as we re-financed our Credit Facility during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 in order to repurchase a portion of the Notes. We had 107,953 outstanding under our Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, net of discounts on the Term Loan, and 0 outstanding under our Credit Facility as of September 30, 2023. The interest rate on our Credit Facility is variable, but was approximately 7.0 percentage points higher than the fixed-rate interest on the Notes during the first half of fiscal year 2025. 
 
 During the third quarter of fiscal year, Mesa issued an intercompany loan denominated in USD to our wholly owned subsidiary, Mesa Germany GmbH, to purchase GKE. Nonoperating income increased for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 as we recorded net unrealized gains on foreign currency resulting from the weakening of the USD against the euro.

(9.7 pt) 

Our effective income tax rate was 10.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 7.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective income tax rate was 11.7 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 21.4 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The change in the effective tax rate for both the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods is primary due to the valuation allowance established on the US deferred taxes during fiscal year 2024. The effective tax rate for both the three and the six months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the statutory federal rate of 21 primarily due to the valuation allowance established on the US deferred taxes during fiscal year 2024. 
 
 Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, and the geographic composition of our pre-tax income. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust our effective income tax rate accordingly. 
 
 Net Income 
 Net income varies with changes in revenues, gross profit, and operating expense (and included 8,611, 6,765 and 2,922 of non-cash: amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation expense, respectively, for the six months ended September 30, 2024). 
 
 Market-Based Awards 
 The performance-based restricted stock awards granted during fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2024 included a market-based component. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash available from our Credit Facility and Open Market Sale Agreement SM , working capital, and potential additional equity and debt offerings. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and potential cash provided by borrowings from our Credit Facility or funds from our Open Market Sale Agreement SM , when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled interest payments on debt, dividend payments, and anticipated capital expenditures. 
 
 Our more significant uses of resources have historically included acquisitions, payments of debt and interest obligations, long-term capital expenditures, and quarterly dividends to shareholders. During fiscal year 2024, we acquired GKE for 87,187, net of cash and financial liabilities acquired and inclusive of working capital adjustments. We expect to pay a holdback of approximately 9,700 (at September 30, 2024 exchange rates) from the acquisition in April 2025, pending adjustments for potential indemnification losses. 
 
 Working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. We had working capital of (45,252) and 65,040 as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had 24,337 and 28,214, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. Our working capital balance is negative as of September 30, 2024 primarily because of the balance on the Notes is now current, due August 15, 2025, which is within 12 months of September 30, 2024. See further discussion below. 

Page 19

Table of Contents 

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we amended and restated our Credit Facility to: 

Allow proceeds from the Credit Facility to be used to redeem some or all of the Notes. 

Add the 75,000 senior secured Term Loan. 

Extend the maturity of the Credit Facility to April 2029. 

Make certain changes to the financial covenants. 

Under the revised Credit Facility, we maintain access to our Revolver, allowing access to up to 125,000 of borrowings. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we borrowed a total of 71,000 under the Revolver to fund the majority of the acquisition of GKE. As of September 30, 2024, 35,500 remained outstanding under the Revolver. During October 2024, we repaid 4,500 on our Revolver. 
 
 We used the 75,000 proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan to enter into a separate, privately negotiated purchase agreements with a limited number of holders of our Notes. Pursuant to the purchase agreements, we purchased 75,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately 71,250. Following these transactions, 97,500 aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding and is now classified as current on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 At the interest rate effective through October 30, 2024, within the next twelve months we expect to incur cash interest expense of approximately 7,300 (adjusted for required future principal payments) on undiscounted borrowings of 104,125 related to the Credit Facility as of the date of this filing. 
 
 We have 97,500 due on the Notes in August 2025. Together with the current portion of our Term Loan, the cash needed for principal debt payments is 101,250 within the next 12 months. We plan use cash on hand, draws against our Revolver, which has 94,000 available as of the date of this filing, and cash generated from operating activities over the next three quarters to fund the amount due. 
 
 In April 2022, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement SM pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of up to 150,000. We have not sold any shares under this agreement. 
 
 We routinely evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions. Future material acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital, assume additional third-party debt or incur other long-term obligations. We believe that we have the ability to issue more equity or debt in the future in order to finance our acquisition and investment activities; however, additional equity or debt financing, or other transactions, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. 
 
 We may from time to time repurchase or take other steps to reduce our debt. These actions may include retirements or refinancing of outstanding debt through tender offers, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. The amount of debt that may be retired, if any, could be material. Retirement would be decided at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and would depend on market conditions, our cash position, and other considerations. 
 
 Dividends 
 We have paid regular quarterly dividends since 2003. We paid dividends of 0.16 per share during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as well as each quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024. 
 
 In October 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.16 per share of common stock, payable on December 16, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 29, 2024. 
 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 We perform analyses at least quarterly to identify potential impairment indicators and to assess whether it is more likely than not that our goodwill reporting units are impaired. We have determined our goodwill reporting units are not impaired as of September 30, 2024; however, impairment losses recorded in the prior fiscal year resulted in a 0 cushion between the fair and carrying values of our Clinical Genomics division and the Immunoassays reporting unit within our Biopharmaceutical Development division as of our most recent annual impairment testing date on January 1, 2024. Revenues related to our Biopharmaceutical Development division were higher than our impairment model indicated; however, our Clinical Genomics reporting unit remains susceptible to future impairment losses if actual results differ significantly from the assumptions used in our most recent impairment tests. While revenues in our Clinical Genomics division have declined somewhat from fiscal year 2024 levels, we deployed cost saving measures late in fiscal year 2024, primarily a reduction in force, and as a result, we believe that our operating cash flows for fiscal year 2025 for Clinical Genomics will approximate the levels used in our recent impairment model. At our last testing date, the fair value of the applicable reporting units was assessed by weighting Gordon Growth and Exit Multiple discounted cash flow models and guideline public company models (one-year forward multiples), relying on unobservable Level 3 inputs, including but not limited to discount rates, expected useful lives, applicable competitors, and anticipated revenues growth and margins. Inputs were established through discussions between management and external valuation specialists, and were based on internal expectations for future performance, market indicators, and reputable valuation research resources. These assumptions required inputs and estimates that are subject to uncertainty such that there is a reasonable possibility that further impairment losses, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements, may occur in the future. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities were as follows (in thousands):

Page 20

Table of Contents 

Cash flows from operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 provided 15,704, a decrease of 4,011 versus the comparable prior year period. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of: 

lower cash collected on accounts receivable, 

higher payments made for income taxes, 

approximately 3,900 more paid for interest as we had more debt outstanding at higher rates; partially offset by 

cash provided by improved operating performance, primarily due to an increase in revenues of 12,193. 

Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to spending on property, plant and equipment, including for our new leased facility in Sweden. 

Cash used in financing activities resulted in a 17,719 use of cash for the six months ended September 30, 2024. Net proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 were almost fully offset by payments made to repurchase the Notes. We used 15,000 of cash to repay the Revolver and 1,875 to pay down the Term Loan in the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13,000 to pay down the Revolver in the comparable prior year period. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments 
 
 We are party to many contractual obligations that involve commitments to make payments to third parties in the ordinary course of business. For a description of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of March 31, 2024, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 28, 2024. 
 
 On a consolidated basis, as of September 30, 2024, we had contractual obligations for open purchase orders of approximately 18,030 for routine purchases of supplies and inventory, the majority of which are payable in less than one year. 
 
 As part of the GKE acquisition, we have agreed to pay the GKE sellers approximately 9,700 (at September 30, 2024 exchange rates) of the acquisition price in April 2025, pending adjustments for potential indemnification losses that may arise. 
 
 As part of the Belyntic acquisition, we agreed to pay 1,500 to the sellers if specified patents related to the technology purchased are issued. The estimated fair value of the probable remaining contingent consideration was 650 as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for information related to future required debt payments. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. These estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgements are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we present organic revenues growth (reported revenues growth excluding revenues from recent acquisitions), as a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that presenting supplemental organic revenues growth facilitates comparability between current period and prior period information, and provides insight into Mesa s short-term and long-term financial trends. We use organic revenue growth internally to forecast and evaluate Mesa s operating performance and to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods, for financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. 
 
 A reconciliation of organic revenues growth to total revenues growth is as follows:

I tem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures a bout Market Risk 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 We face exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of the applicable subsidiary. We also face translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into USD, our functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into USD using average exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the USD. Our Biopharmaceutical Development division is particularly susceptible to currency exposures since it incurs a substantial portion of its expenses in Swedish Krona, while most of the division's revenue contracts are in USD and euros. Therefore, when the Swedish Krona strengthens or weakens against the USD, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. As we continue to consummate acquisitions of companies with foreign operations or with functional currencies other than the USD, our foreign currency exchange rate risk will increase. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our international subsidiaries' assets and liabilities is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity. 
 
 Interest Rates 
 Our Credit Facility bears interest at either a base rate or a SOFR rate plus an applicable spread. Based on the balance outstanding as of the date of this filing and required future principal payments, we estimate that if interest rates increased 1 percentage point, we would incur approximately 920 of additional cash interest expense per year. 
 
 Inflation Risk 
 Inflation generally impacts us by increasing our costs of labor, materials, and freight. The rates of inflation experienced in recent years have not had a significant impact on our financial statements as inflationary cost increases have been offset by annual price increases. However, any price increases imposed may lead to declines in sales volume if competitors do not similarly adjust prices. We cannot reasonably estimate our ability to successfully recover any impact of inflation cost increases into the future. 
 
 Other 
 We have no derivative instruments. We have minimal exposure to commodity market risks. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report, due to a material weakness identified in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 that has not yet been remediated. Two of the material weaknesses identified in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 were remediated in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. The material weaknesses are described further below. 
 
 Prior Year Material Weaknesses 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As disclosed in Part II Item 9A. "Controls and Procedures" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, during fiscal year 2024 we identified three material weaknesses in our internal controls: 

Controls over technical accounting for complex and non-routine transactions - We did not have adequate supervision and review controls over complex technical accounting related to non-routine goodwill impairment transactions and related analyses. 

Controls over determining the useful lives of our recently acquired intangibles - During the GKE acquisition's measurement period, we selected a useful life over which to amortize acquired customer relationships, but there was evidence that a longer useful life may be appropriate. 

Certain controls related to change management and logical access controls related to our enterprise resource planning tool, part of our information technology general controls set, were not operating effectively for a portion of the year ended March 31, 2024. The failure of these information technology general controls extended to automated application controls across portions of financial reporting and business transaction cycles which rely upon the affected information technology application controls. 

Remediation Status for Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Beginning during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and continuing into the three months ended September 30, 2024, we implemented our previously-disclosed remediation plans: 

Technical accounting for complex and non-routine transactions - We executed two transactions during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2025, partial repurchases of the Notes and the amendment and modification of our Credit Facility, which met our definition of complex technical accounting matters for which we should obtain technical accounting support from an outside expert. We identified and selected qualified third-party advisors, including validation that that the advisors possessed adequate knowledge to address the complexities of the applicable technical accounting matters, and we ensured analyses were appropriately reviewed, ensuring consensus on accounting conclusions. Following the execution of our remediation plan for these transactions, management has concluded that the material weakness has been remediated. 

Page 22

Table of Contents 

Assessment of useful lives of recently acquired intangibles - We modified the useful life of our customer relationship intangible and recorded an immaterial cumulative effect true-up to release amortization expense during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Following the execution of our remediation plan related to the useful lives of recently acquired intangible assets, management has concluded that the material weakness has been remediated. 

Information technology general controls ("ITGCs") - We have not yet remediated the material weakness related to ITGCs. We believe that our existing user access review control over our ERP was not designed to operate at a precise enough level to appropriately identify the user groups tested in certain of our other logical access and change management controls. Therefore, we have designed a new user access control regarding users of our ERP that will operate at a higher degree of precision compared with our existing user access control and will enhance our review of roles, particularly roles with the ability to add, edit or delete transactions. Management has modified the reports used as source data to test change management and logical access controls in our enterprise resource planning tool, which we expect will allow us to conclude that the related controls are operating effectively by the end of fiscal year 2025. We have engaged a third party specialist to assist in the remediation of our ITGCs. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We acquired GKE during the third quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. As such, the scope of our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting does not yet include GKE. This exclusion is in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from our scope for one year from the date of acquisition. GKE GmbH and Sal GmbH will be included in the scope of our assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting, and GKE China will be included for cash, in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2025. The Company's total assets as of September 30, 2024 include 105,000 of assets held by GKE. The Company's consolidated revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include 5,863 from GKE. 
 
 Other than as discussed above, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
