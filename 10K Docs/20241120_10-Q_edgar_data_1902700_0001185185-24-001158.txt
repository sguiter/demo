In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

Pioneer Greens Farms, Inc., (the Company was originally incorporated in Florida in January 2019. In 2019, the Company entered a joint-venture with Colorado- based Sugar Magnolia Hemp Farms LLC to cultivate hemp in the State of Colorado. 

Due to the Company being based in Florida, it decided to apply for a hemp cultivation license in the State of Florida when the State of Florida legalized hemp production in July 2019. The climate in Florida enables the farms to grow three to four crops per year with much lower overhead as opposed to Colorado where only one crop can be grown annually at higher operational costs in an extremely competitive Colorado marketplace. Pioneer Green Farms entered a 25-year lease of 5 acres from Drymon s Citrus Nursery Drymon s ). Drymon s has been involved in citrus farming in Florida for many decades and has met all the State s guidelines for licensed applicants. Pioneer owns the farming infrastructure which is expansive and controls the revenues from the flower and oil extracts. 

In April 2020, Drymon s was granted a hemp cultivation license by the Plant Division of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The Company uses and controls the Drymon hemp cultivation license, as part of its lease agreement with Drymon. Pioneer was able to build, construct and outfit 4 - 30 ft x 100 ft greenhouses on Drymon s farm with water, lighting, and all equipment and specifications to ensure optimal uniform growing conditions and crop consistency approved by State regulations. 

In January 2022, the Company completed the purchase of over five (5) acres of farmland in Myakka City, Manatee County, Florida. The Company intends to expand its operations by building at least six (6) more greenhouses and planting over eight thousand (8,000) outdoor hemp plants. 

In November 2023, the Company launched two new products, Ink Bomb Tattoo Healing Spray and Healing Wash, and Big Banana Organic Libido Enhancer for His and Hers. The Company expects to benefit from this growing market and is optimistic that these products will generate a new revenue stream. These products will be marketed and sold directly by the Company, and through affiliate sales partner programs. 

Impact of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID 19) and other Macroeconomic Factors on the Company s Business Operations 

The global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID 19) has led to severe disruptions in general economic activities worldwide, as businesses and governments have taken broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. In light of the uncertain and continually evolving situation relating to the spread of COVID 19, this pandemic could pose a risk to the Company. The extent to which the coronavirus may impact the Company s business operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. The Company intends to continue to monitor the situation and may adjust its current business plans as more information and guidance become available. 

There is also significant uncertainty as to the effect that the coronavirus may have on the amount and type of financing available to the Company in the future. 

Macroeconomic factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, governmental responses there to and possible recession caused thereby also add significant uncertainty to our operations and possible effects to the amount and type of financing available to the Company in the future. 

Since our inception, we devoted substantially all of our efforts and funding to planting and harvesting hemp for extraction and raising capital. We have not yet generated revenues from our planned operations. However, in November 2023 the Company launched two new products, Ink Bomb Tattoo Healing Spray and Healing Wash, and Big Banana Organic Libido Enhancer for His and Hers, which the Company expects will continue to generate revenue. The Company also sells products through its website and retail store.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements that have been prepared under accounting principle generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

A summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this filing. Of these policies, we believe that the following items are the most critical in preparing our financial statements. 

USE OF ESTIMATES: 

Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION: 

Revenue from sale of goods is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income of the Company when significant risks and rewards of the ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyers. 

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE: 

Accounts Receivable (AR) is the payment which the Company will receive from its customers who have purchased its goods services in the last month of the year and on credit terms. Usually the credit period is short, approximately a few days. 

ASSESSMENT OF COLLECTABILITY: 

Recording of Accounts Receivable: All amounts due on physical delivery of the merchandise from the drop shipper, must be promptly recorded as an accounts receivable. Each account receivable must be recorded and maintained until payment is received or the recorded amount is written off or extinguished. 

An adequate provision for doubtful accounts must be established. When all reasonable efforts fail to collect an account receivable and it has been approved for write off, the related provision for doubtful accounts should be reduced. 

Statements to Debtors: Statements must be issued to debtors, on a monthly basis, providing meaningful and concise information on the status of their debts. 

Accounts receivable are considered overdue when a debtor does not pay or resolve the debt within 30 days from the invoice date or a written request for payment to the debtor. 

All actions taken to collect overdue accounts must be documented.

Table of Contents 

If there is no response after the initial contact at the 30 day point (within 30 day period 60 days from date of invoice),to the Company will take prompt and vigorous action to collect overdue accounts receivable. 

Accounts receivable, in most cases, should be at least 30 days overdue (i.e., 60 days after invoice notification), before staff advises debtors that their accounts are overdue and that the accounts may be: 

o 

turned over to a private collection agency 

o 

subject to legal action; 

o 

credit privileges will be revoked and/or account may be suspended. 

Most Recent accounting pronouncements 

Refer to Note 2 in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements. 

Impact of Most Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

There were no recent accounting pronouncements that have had a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Management does not expect that its internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. Control systems, no matter how well-conceived and managed, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include those judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. 

Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as of September 30, 2024, The Company conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, based on the material weaknesses discussed below, the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Act Commission s rules and forms and that its disclosure controls are not effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The Company s internal controls are not effective for the following reasons, (1) there are no entity level controls, because of the limited time and abilities of the Company s three officers, (2) there is no separate audit committee, and (3) the Company has not implemented adequate system and manual controls. As a result, the Company s internal controls have inherent weaknesses, which may increase the risks of errors in financial reporting under current operations and accordingly are not effective as evaluated against the criteria set forth in the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 version). Based on the evaluation, management concluded that the Company s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Even though there are inherent weaknesses, management has taken steps to minimize the risk. The Company uses a third-party consultant to review transactions for appropriate technical accounting, reconcile accounts, review significant transactions, and prepare financial statements. Any deviation or errors are reported to management. 

The Company can provide no assurance that its internal controls over financial reporting will be compliant in the near future. As revenues permit, the Company will enhance its internal controls through additional software and other means. If and when it becomes a listed company under SEC rules, the Company intends to create an audit committee comprised of independent directors. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the last quarterly period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, the internal control over financial reporting.
