Actual amortization expense to be reported in future periods could differ from these estimates as a result of acquisitions, divestitures, and asset impairments, among other factors. impairment losses were recorded against the other intangibles during each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined that there were no triggering events or circumstances to indicate that the carrying value of the finite-lived asset group may not be recoverable. Based on the assessment performed, we concluded that an impairment charge to finite-lived intangible assets was not required as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 and the useful lives remain appropriate. Goodwill impairment losses were recorded against the goodwill during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company determined that there were no events or circumstances that indicated that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's current and expected cash flows, and the macro-economic and industry conditions have not significantly changed, while the Company s market capitalization materially increased since December 31, 2023. After assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determined that there were no events or circumstances in the fourth quarter of 2023 and third quarter of 2024 that indicated that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount. Therefore, an impairment charge to goodwill was not required as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Certain future events and circumstances could result in changes to our assumptions and judgments used in the impairment tests. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the total fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to fall below carrying values and a non-cash impairment charge would be required. Such a charge may have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

and may contain options to extend up to and/or terminate early. Options to extend are included in leased right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet when we are reasonably certain to renew a lease. Since the implicit rate of such leases is unknown and we may not be reasonably certain to renew leases, the Company elected to apply a collateralized incremental borrowing rate to facility leases on the original lease term in calculating the present value of future lease payments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average discount rate for operating leases were and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was years and years, respectively. The Company has entered into various short-term operating leases, primarily for test houses and office equipment with initial terms of 12 months or less. These short-term leases are not recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet, and the related short-term lease expense was and , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total operating lease cost was million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The variance from the U.S. federal statutory rate of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the utilization of deferred tax attributes that had a full valuation allowance. Management assesses its deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether all or any portion of the asset is more likely than not unrealizable under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740. The Company is required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of the asset that management concludes is more likely than not to be unrealizable.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) The Company maintains the 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) that provides employees an opportunity to purchase common stock through payroll deductions. The ESPP is implemented through consecutive -month offering periods commencing on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The purchase price is set at of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on either the first or last trading day of the offering period, whichever is lower. Annual

Compensation expense is calculated using the fair value of the employees purchase rights under the Black-Scholes model. The Company currently uses authorized and unissued shares to satisfy share award exercises.

Core Markets 
 Airgain s core business primarily focuses on the following three key markets: 
 The enterprise market requires reliable wireless access across various settings, including smart cities, utilities, factories, buildings, campuses, transportation hubs, stadiums, and suburban developments. Our NimbeLink embedded modems serve numerous enterprise sectors requiring cellular connectivity such as packaging, logistics, EV charging, smart cities, smart buildings, agriculture, asset tracking, and self-service innovations. These NimbeLink cellular modems, which are both patented and end-device certified, minimize the need for additional carrier certifications. Our asset trackers are deployed globally across transportation, supply chain, and other specialized applications. In addition to hardware, our asset tracking offering includes a recurring revenue component, our subscription-based NLink cloud-based device enablement platform, which allows for deployment and integration with enterprise systems via open application programming interfaces. Our custom products feature joint engineering collaboration with strategic customers to develop industrial IoT products (IIoT) for specific applications while helping them reduce their time to market. Our enterprise IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) antennas are extensively deployed in diverse systems, devices, and applications, including access points, gateways, FWA devices and utility meters. In the second quarter of 2024, we started shipping our new line of FWA products designed to address 5G connectivity challenges, reduce deployment costs and enhance customer experiences. In 2024, we continue to advance with our Lighthouse customer trials -smart repeaters platform designed to reduce an operator s capital expenses for extending range, while enhancing 5G coverage. 

The consumer market represents a vast audience utilizing wireless-enabled devices. Our embedded antennas are deployed in various consumer applications including access points, wireless gateways, FWA devices, Wi-Fi routers and extenders, smart TVs, smart home devices, and set-top boxes. These consumer products support a variety of technologies, products and services, including LTE, 5G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LPWAN and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System). We continue to grow our relationships with MSOs and MNOs as the market evolves with both wired and wireless broadband internet offerings. We currently ship a tier-one MNO embedded antenna system and a tier-one MSO Wi-Fi 7 router antenna system. 

In the automotive market, our products are deployed in a wide range of vehicles in the fleet and aftermarket applications, supporting a variety of technologies that include Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, LPWAN, GNSS, and Bluetooth. Fleet and aftermarket products in the automotive market typically consist of applications where vehicular wireless routers are paired with external antenna systems to provide connectivity to mobile assets. We offer a full line of external fleet antennas that are designed to be rugged, reliable, and flexible to meet almost any need. We design our products for performance, quality, and long product life, and our antennas connect to almost any vehicular router or modem. These antennas include high-performance and low-profile versions that mount on the roof, trunk, windshield, or dashboard and are optimized for 5G, 4G, Wi-Fi, and GNSS. In the third quarter 2024, we expanded our product offering with a second generation AirgainConnect Fleet system solution a low profile, roof-mounted, all-in-one 5G vehicle gateway that provides 5G cellular connectivity with built-in GPS and Wi-Fi hotspot functionalities. 

Macro-economic Conditions 
 Macroeconomic conditions continue to create demand softness in certain markets. This demand softness combined with excess inventories, drove a sequential decline in our enterprise market sales. While we experience a market recovery with our consumer customers, we anticipate the inventory surplus some of our enterprise and automotive customers have may extend into the first half of 2025. We believe the previously broad demand softness that we experienced last year has become more product and customer specific, as the industry re-calibrates to optimal inventory levels. We remain focused on the execution of our strategic product initiatives and operational efficiencies, which lay the foundation of our revenue and profitability growth when market conditions improve. 
 Factors Affecting Our Operating Results 
 We believe that our performance and future success depend upon several factors including macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties, epidemic diseases, impact of inflation on consumer spending, and our ability to transition from a component provider to a wireless systems provider and to develop technology leadership and expand our markets. 
 Our performance and future success also depend on factors such as continued investments in our growth, our ability to expand into growing addressable markets, including consumer, enterprise, and automotive, the average selling prices of our products per device, manufacturing costs and our ability to diversify the number of devices that incorporate our antenna products. Our customers are price conscious, and our operating results are affected by pricing pressure which may force us to lower prices below our established list prices. In addition, a few end-customer devices which incorporate 
 25 

our antenna products comprise a significant amount of our sales, and the discontinuation or modification of such devices may materially and adversely affect our sales and results of operations. Our ability to maintain or increase our sales depends on, among other things: 
 new and existing end customers selecting our solutions for their wireless devices and networks; 

investments in our growth to address customer needs; 

development of our product offerings and technology solutions; 

our ability to target new end markets; 

the proliferation of Wi-Fi connected home devices and data intensive applications; 

the impact of global supply shortages on our business and that of our end customers; 

international expansion in light of continuing global tensions; and 

the ability to successfully integrate past and any future acquisitions. 

In addition, inflation generally affects us by increasing our raw material and employee-related costs and other expenses. Our financial condition and results of operations may also be impacted by other factors we may not be able to control, such as uncertain global economic conditions, pandemics and epidemics, global trade disputes or political instability, as well as conflicts around the world. We do not believe that such factors had a material adverse impact on our results of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 While each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges we must successfully address. We discuss many of these risks, uncertainties and other factors in greater detail in the section entitled Risk Factors included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Seasonality 
 Our operating results historically have not been subject to significant seasonal variations. Although it is difficult to make broad generalizations, our sales tend to be lower in the first quarter of each year compared to other quarters due to the Lunar New Year. Results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year and these patterns may change because of general customer demand or product cycles. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
 Sales 
 We primarily generate revenue from the sales of our products. We recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control over promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. We generally recognize product sales at the time of shipment to our customers, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We also generate service revenue from agreements to provide design, engineering, and testing services as well as subscription revenue from the sale of data plans. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 The cost of goods sold reflects the cost of producing antenna, embedded modem and system solutions products that are shipped to our customers as well as costs incurred for service agreements. This primarily includes manufacturing costs of our products payable to our third-party CMs. The cost of goods sold that we generate from services and subscription revenues primarily includes personnel costs and the cost to maintain data lines. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses are classified into three categories: research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative. The largest component of expense is personnel costs, which includes salaries, employee benefit costs, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for depreciation of equipment, facilities and information technology. Allocated costs for facilities consist of amortization of leasehold improvements as well as rent and utility expenses and taxes. Operating expenses are generally recognized as incurred. 
 Research and Development . Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and project development costs. These expenses include work related to the design, development and testing of antennas, modems and system solutions. These expenses include salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits, bonuses, project development and testing, prototype material, consulting, travel, and similar costs, and depreciation and allocated costs for 
 26 

certain facilities. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in the development of new solutions and markets, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total sales. 
 Sales and Marketing . Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and facility-related costs for our sales, marketing, and business development personnel, stock-based compensation and bonuses earned by our sales personnel, and commissions earned by our third-party sales representative firms. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of trade shows, advertising, marketing programs, promotional materials, demonstration equipment, travel, and allocated costs for certain facilities. We expect sales and marketing expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of total sales. 
 General and Administrative . General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and facility related costs for our executive, legal, human resource finance, and administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation, as well as legal, accounting, other professional services fees, depreciation, and other corporate expenses. We expect general and administrative expenses to fluctuate as we grow our operations. 
 
 Other (Income) Expense 
 Interest Income, net . Interest income consists of interest from our cash and cash equivalents offset by interest expense which consists of interest charges on credit card charges and certain vendor bills. 
 Other Income and Expense. Other income and expense consists of realized foreign exchange gains or losses, the loss from disposal of property and equipment, and other income and expenses. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. It is difficult for us to project future taxable income as the timing and size of sales of our products are variable and difficult to predict. We concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will utilize our deferred tax assets other than those that are offset by reversing temporary differences. 
 Results of Operations 
 The following tables set forth our operating results for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total sales for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of 7.3 million at September 30, 2024. 
 Prior to 2013 and for the years ended 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, we have incurred net losses. As a result, we have an accumulated deficit of 83.5 million at September 30, 2024. 
 We plan to continue to invest for long-term growth, including expanding our engineering and sales teams to execute on our product roadmap and further penetrate domestic and international markets. We anticipate that these investments will continue to increase in absolute dollars. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months.

Net cash used in operating activities. Net cash used by operating activities was 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was primarily driven by the net loss of 6.7 million and a 2.9 million net change in operating assets and liabilities, offset by 6.1 million in non-cash expenses. 
 Net cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was for purchases of property and equipment. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities of 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily from 3.0 million of net proceeds after fees and expenses from the issuance of approximately 629,000 shares of common stock via our ATM offering program. Additionally, we received 0.2 million primarily from the proceeds of common stock issuances under the ESPP. These proceeds were partially offset by 0.1 million tax payments for net share settlement of restricted stock units. 
 Employee Retention Credit 
 On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law providing an employee retention credit (ERC), which is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes on qualified wages. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act amended the qualifications for eligible employers who could apply and extended the availability of the ERC employment taxes on qualified wages paid after December 31, 2020 through September 30, 2021. We believe that we qualify for application of the ERC on qualified wages from the second quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021. 
 In August 2023, we applied for ERC refunds, totaling 2.5 million, net of professional fees. Pending the Internal Revenue Service s (IRS) review and determination of our eligibility, we are uncertain as to the timeframe of credit receipts. There is no assurance we will ultimately receive the amounts that we currently expect, if any, or the timeframe of any such receipt, based on IRS review or otherwise. As of September 30, 2024, we have not recognized the ERC in our financial statements. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources Assessment 
 As of December 31, 2023, management performed the annual assessment of the Company's ability to meet its obligations as they become due within one year based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable. Following ASC 205-40 guidance, management considered quantitative and qualitative information to evaluate the Company's ability to meet obligations. Based on the analysis of the relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably known as of December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that it is probable that it will be able to meet all of its financial obligations as they become due in the next twelve months. 
 The relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably known as of September 30, 2024 related to the Company have not significantly changed since December 31, 2023. Therefore, the resulting cash inflows along with the existing funds are expected to be sufficient for the Company s financial obligations as they become due in the next twelve months. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of our business during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to the information regarding our contractual obligations that was disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 At-the-Market Sales Agreement 
 On March 7, 2024, the Company entered into an At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement) with Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC (Craig-Hallum). Pursuant to the Sales Agreement, the Company may sell, at its option, up to an aggregate of 5.0 million in shares of its common stock through Craig-Hallum, as sales agent. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, Craig-Hallum may sell the shares, if any, only by methods deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). The Company has agreed to pay Craig-Hallum a sales commission of 3.0 of the gross proceeds for sales under the Sales Agreement and to provide Craig-Hallum with customary indemnification and contribution rights, 
 31 

including for liabilities under the Securities Act. In addition, the Company is required to reimburse Craig-Hallum for certain specified expenses in connection with entering into the Sales Agreement. 
 The Company is not obligated to sell, and Craig-Hallum is not obligated to buy or sell, any shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement. No assurance can be given that the Company will sell any additional shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement, or, if it does, as to the price or amount of shares of common stock that the Company may sell or the dates when such sales will take place. As of September 30, 2024, 1.7 million remains available under the Sales Agreement for future sales of the Company s common stock. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported sales and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Goodwill Impairment Assessment 
 For the annual goodwill impairment assessment, as of December 31, 2023, the Company determined that there were no events or circumstances that indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. Based on the assessment performed, we concluded that an impairment charge to goodwill was not required as of December 31, 2023. 
 The Company evaluated the goodwill impairment considerations as of September 30, 2024. The Company's current and expected cash flows, and the macro-economic and industry conditions have not significantly changed since the annual goodwill impairment assessment that was performed as of December 31, 2023, while the Company s market capitalization materially increased since December 31, 2023. After assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determined that there were no events or circumstances as of September 30, 2024 that indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. Since there was no indication that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company determined that a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not necessary as of September 30, 2024. Based on the assessment performed, we concluded that an impairment charge to goodwill was not required as of September 30, 2024. 
 Certain future events and circumstances, including adverse changes in the business and economic conditions and changes in customer behavior could result in changes to our assumptions and judgments used in the impairment tests. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the total fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to fall below carrying values and a non-cash impairment charge would be required. Such a charge may have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we may be a party to legal proceedings and subject to claims incident in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 
 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS 
 A description of the risk factors associated with our business is included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to such risk factors. In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The occurrence of any of the risks discussed in such filings, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial, could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
