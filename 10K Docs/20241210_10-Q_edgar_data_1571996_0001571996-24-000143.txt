 The sale of Secureworks does not meet the criteria for discontinued operations reporting, and as a result its operating results and cash flows are not separately stated as a discontinued operation in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As Secureworks does not meet the requirements for a reportable segment, its operating results are included within Other businesses. 
 
 Other Events On October 4, 2023, the Company established a new consumer revolving financing program with Comenity Capital Bank, a subsidiary of Bread Financial Holdings, Inc. Bread ), under which transactions are originated, owned, serviced, and collected by Bread. Under the agreement, the Company also sold its U.S. consumer revolving customer receivables portfolio for total cash consideration of approximately million, resulting in an immaterial gain recognized within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company has no continuing involvement with these receivables, which are serviced by Bread.

 Equity and Other Securities 
 
 Equity and other securities include strategic investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Investments in marketable securities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Investments in non-marketable equity and other securities represent early-stage companies without readily determinable fair values. The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative for non-marketable securities. Under the alternative, the Company measures investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, adjusted for observable price changes. The Company makes a separate election to use the alternative for each eligible investment and is required to reassess at each reporting period whether an investment qualifies for the alternative. In evaluating these investments for impairment or observable price changes, the Company uses inputs including pre- and post-money valuations of recent financing events and the impact of those events on its fully diluted ownership percentages, as well as other available information regarding the issuer s historical and forecasted performance.

 ____________________ 
 (a) For the three months ended November 1, 2024 and November 3, 2023, net gains on non-marketable securities are primarily due to upward adjustments for observable price changes. For the three months ended November 3, 2023, these were partially offset by losses due to impairments. 

Fixed Income Debt Securities 
 
 As of November 1, 2024 and February 2, 2024, the Company held fixed income debt securities of million and million, respectively, which it intends to hold to maturity. These investments are recorded at amortized cost and approximate fair value. As of November 1, 2024, the Company held million in fixed income debt securities which will mature within one year and million in fixed income debt securities which will mature within five years.

 The Company s lease and loan arrangements with customers are aggregated primarily into the following categories: 
 
 Fixed-term leases and loans The Company enters into financing arrangements with customers who seek lease financing for equipment. DFS leases are generally classified as sales-type leases or operating leases. Leases with business customers have fixed terms of generally two to . 
 
 The Company also offers fixed-term loans to qualified small businesses, large commercial accounts, governmental organizations, educational entities, and certain individual consumer customers. These loans are repaid in equal payments including interest and have defined terms of generally three to . The fair value of the fixed-term loan portfolio is determined using market observable inputs. The carrying value of these loans approximates fair value. 
 
 Revolving loans The Company primarily offers revolving loans to small and medium-sized commercial customers. Revolving loans provide qualified customers with a revolving credit line for the purchase of products and services offered by Dell Technologies. Revolving loans in the United States bear interest at a variable annual percentage rate that is tied to the prime rate. Based on historical payment patterns, revolving loan transactions are typically repaid within on average. Due to the short-term nature of the revolving loan portfolio, the carrying value of the portfolio approximates fair value. 
 
 Prior to the sale of the U.S. consumer revolving customer receivables portfolio on October 4, 2023, described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company offered private label credit financing under the Dell Preferred Account DPA program. The DPA product was primarily offered to individual consumer customers. During the three months ended November 1, 2024, the Company discontinued remaining offerings under the revolving loan portfolio. The Company will support existing customer arrangements as well as transition these customers to fixed-term offerings. 
 
 Flexible consumption models, as defined above, further enable the Company to offer its customers the option to pay over time to provide them with financial and operational flexibility. Such models may result in identification of embedded lease arrangements that lead to the recognition of operating or sales-type leases.

 Aging is likely to fluctuate as a result of the variability in volume of large transactions entered into over the period, and the administrative processes that accompany those transactions. Aging is also impacted by the timing of the Company s fiscal period end date relative to calendar month-end customer payment due dates. As a result of these factors, fluctuations in aging from period to period do not necessarily indicate a material change in the collectibility of the portfolio. 
 
 Fixed-term customer receivables are placed on non-accrual status if principal or interest is past due and considered delinquent, or if there is concern about the collectibility of a specific customer receivable. The receivables identified as doubtful for collectibility may be classified as current for aging purposes. Aged revolving portfolio customer receivables identified as delinquent are charged off.

 The categories shown in the tables above segregate customer receivables based on the relative degrees of credit risk. Credit quality indicators for revolving and fixed-term accounts are generally updated on a periodic basis. 
 
 An internal grading system is utilized that assigns a credit level score based on a number of considerations, including liquidity, operating performance, and industry outlook. The grading criteria and classifications for the fixed-term products differ from those for the revolving products as loss experience varies between these product and customer groups. The credit quality categories cannot be compared between the different classes as loss experience varies substantially between the classes.

 Asset-Based Financing Facility The Company maintains an asset-based financing facility in the United States, which is a revolving facility for fixed-term leases and loans. This debt is collateralized solely by the U.S. lease and loan payments and associated equipment in the facility. The asset-based financing facility consists of tranches, with effective dates through July 7, 2025 and July 7, 2026, respectively. As of November 1, 2024, the total debt capacity related to the asset-based financing facility was billion. The debt has a variable interest rate, and the duration of the debt is based on the terms of the underlying lease and loan payment streams. The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to economically convert a portion of this debt from a floating rate to a fixed rate. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Company s interest rate swaps.

The debt under this facility has a variable interest rate, and the duration of the debt is based on the terms of the underlying lease and loan payment streams. This facility is effective through December 23, 2024 and had a total debt capacity of million as of November 1, 2024. 
 
 The securitization facility contains standard structural features related to the performance of the securitized receivables, which include defined credit losses, delinquencies, average credit scores, and minimum collection requirements. In the event one or more of these criteria are not met and the Company is unable to restructure the program, no further funding of receivables will be permitted and the timing of the Company s expected cash flows from over-collateralization will be delayed. As of November 1, 2024, these criteria were met. 
 
 Other Borrowings In connection with the Company s international financing operations, the Company has entered into revolving structured financing debt programs related to its fixed-term lease and loan products sold in Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and Singapore. The debt under these programs has a variable interest rate. 
 
 The duration of the debt in Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and the Middle East is based on the terms of the underlying lease and loan payment streams. These facilities are collateralized solely by the lease and loan payments and associated equipment in their respective region or country. The Canadian facility had a total debt capacity of million as of November 1, 2024 and is effective through January 16, 2025. The European facility had a total debt capacity of million as of November 1, 2024 and is effective through December 14, 2026.

 NOTE 7 

Foreign Exchange Risk 
 
 The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Hedge accounting is applied based upon the criteria established by accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The risk of loss associated with purchased options is limited to premium amounts paid for the option contracts. The risk of loss associated with forward contracts is equal to the exchange rate differential from the time the contract is entered into until the time it is settled. The majority of these contracts typically expire in or less. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended November 1, 2024 and November 3, 2023, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges related to foreign exchange contracts that had a material impact on the Company s results of operations due to the probability that the forecasted cash flows would not occur. 
 
 The Company uses forward contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. These contracts generally expire in or less, are considered economic hedges, and are not designated for hedge accounting. The change in the fair value of these instruments represents a natural hedge as their gains and losses offset the changes in the underlying fair value of the monetary assets and liabilities due to movements in currency exchange rates. 
 
 In connection with DFS operations in Europe, forward contracts are used to hedge financing receivables denominated in foreign currencies other than Euro. These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and most expire within or less. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows related to the interest rate payments on structured financing debt. The interest rate swaps economically convert the variable rate on the structured financing debt to a fixed interest rate to match the underlying fixed rate being received on fixed-term customer leases and loans. These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and most expire within or less. 
 
 Interest rate swaps are utilized to manage the interest rate risk, at a portfolio level, associated with DFS operations in Europe. The interest rate swaps economically convert the fixed rate on financing receivables to a three-month Euribor floating rate in order to match the floating rate nature of the banks funding pool. The Company also uses interest rate swaps to manage the cash flows related to interest payments on senior unsecured eurobonds. The interest rate swaps economically convert the fixed rate on the Company s bonds to a floating rate to match the underlying lease repayments profile. These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and most expire within or less. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Dell Bank senior unsecured eurobonds.

 Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing 
 
 Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter and whenever events or circumstances may indicate that an impairment has occurred. 
 
 For the annual impairment review of the Infrastructure Solutions Group ISG and Client Solutions Group CSG reporting units during the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, the Company elected to bypass the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. In electing to bypass the qualitative assessment, the Company proceeded directly to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test to measure the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit relative to its carrying amount, and to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized, if any. For the remaining reporting units, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. The qualitative assessment included consideration of the relevant events and circumstances affecting the reporting unit, including macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and trends in the public company market valuation, where applicable. Additionally, Secureworks entry into a definitive agreement, pursuant to which Secureworks will be acquired in an all-cash transaction for approximately billion, as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, provided a fair value indication that the Secureworks reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. 
 
 Management exercised significant judgment related to the above assessments, including the identification of goodwill reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to goodwill reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit. For the quantitative goodwill impairment test, the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit is generally estimated using a combination of public company multiples and discounted cash flow methodologies. The discounted cash flow and public company multiples methodologies require significant judgment, including estimation of future revenues, gross margins, and operating expenses, which are dependent on internal forecasts, current and anticipated economic conditions and trends, selection of market multiples through assessment of the reporting unit s performance relative to peer competitors, the estimation of the long-term revenue growth rate and discount rate of the Company s business, and the determination of the Company s weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of the goodwill reporting unit, potentially resulting in a non-cash impairment charge. 
 
 The fair value of the indefinite-lived trade names is generally estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. These methodologies require significant judgment, including the estimation of future revenue, the estimation of the long-term revenue growth rate of the Company s business and the determination of the Company s weighted average cost of capital and royalty rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, potentially resulting in a non-cash impairment charge. 
 
 Based on the results of the annual impairment test performed during the three months ended November 1, 2024, the fair values of each of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles exceeded their carrying values. No goodwill or indefinite-lived assets impairment test was performed during the nine months ended November 1, 2024 other than the Company s annual impairment review and the assessment of Secureworks.

 Remaining Performance Obligations Remaining performance obligations represent the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations not delivered, or partially undelivered, as of the end of the reporting period. Remaining performance obligations include deferred revenue plus unbilled amounts not yet recorded in deferred revenue. The value of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations as of November 1, 2024 was approximately billion. The Company expects to recognize approximately of remaining performance obligations as revenue in the next , and the remainder thereafter. 
 
 The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations does not include amounts owed under cancelable contracts where there is no substantive termination penalty. The Company applied the practical expedient to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed. 
 
 Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidation, adjustments for revenue that have not materialized, and adjustments for currency.

 Legal Matters 
 
 The Company is involved in various claims, suits, assessments, investigations, and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, including those identified below, consisting of matters involving consumer, antitrust, tax, intellectual property, and other issues on a global basis. 
 
 The Company accrues a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. The Company reviews these accruals at least quarterly and adjusts them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and the Company s views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations, or legal proceedings change, changes in the Company s accrued liabilities are recorded in the period in which such a determination is made. For some matters, the incurrence of a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore accruals have not been made. 
 
 The following is a discussion of the Company s significant legal matters and other proceedings: 
 
 Class Actions Related to the Class V Transaction On December 28, 2018, the Company completed a transaction (the Class V transaction in which it paid billion in cash and issued shares of its Class C Common Stock to holders of its Class V Common Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Class V Common Stock. As a result of the Class V transaction, the tracking stock feature of the Company s capital structure associated with the Class V Common Stock was terminated. Certain stockholders of the Company subsequently brought class action complaints arising out of the Class V transaction in which they named as defendants (collectively, the defendants Michael S. Dell and certain other directors serving on the Company s board of directors at the time of the Class V transaction (collectively, the director defendants ), certain stockholders of the Company, consisting of Mr. Dell and Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. and certain of its affiliated funds (collectively, the stockholder defendants ), and Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, which served as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the transaction. The plaintiffs generally alleged that the director defendants and the stockholder defendants breached their fiduciary duties under Delaware law to the former holders of the Class V Common Stock in connection with the Class V transaction by offering a transaction value that was allegedly billions of dollars below fair value. 
 
 As previously reported, during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended February 3, 2023, the plaintiffs and the defendants entered into an agreement to settle the lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement, the plaintiffs agreed to the dismissal of all claims upon payment of a total of billion (the settlement amount ), which includes all costs, expenses and fees of the plaintiff class relating to the action and its resolution. On May 16, 2023, during the fiscal year ended February 2, 2024, the Company paid the settlement amount following approval of the settlement by the Delaware Court of Chancery. This matter is no longer material to the Company.

European patent is infringed by certain Intel processors and those of the Company s products that incorporate those processors. R2 sought an injunction prohibiting the sale of the allegedly infringing products and damages for the alleged infringement. The court conducted a trial on December 7, 2023 and, on February 7, 2024, issued a decision in favor of R2 and imposed an injunction prohibiting the sale and use of such products in Germany by Dell GmbH, and requiring Dell GmbH to issue a communication to certain customers recalling the covered products sold since March 5, 2020. On February 8, 2024, the Company filed an appeal. In April and May 2024, R2 filed lawsuits in Paris, France and Milan, Italy, against affiliates of Intel Corporation Intel and of the Company, raising similar allegations. Intel agreed to defend the foregoing actions and indemnify the Company and its affiliates against certain losses incurred by the Company in connection with R2 s claims. On August 30, 2024, Intel and R2 publicly announced an agreement to dismiss all litigation between the two companies that would include dismissal of all litigation against all subsidiaries of Dell Technologies named in the foregoing actions. Pursuant to that agreement, the Italian lawsuit was dismissed on September 2, 2024, the German lawsuit was dismissed on September 4, 2024, and the French lawsuit was dismissed on September 6, 2024. 
 
 Other Litigation Dell does not currently anticipate that any of the other legal proceedings it is involved in will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 
 In accordance with the relevant accounting guidance, the Company provides disclosures of matters where it is at least reasonably possible that the Company could experience a material loss exceeding the amounts already accrued for these or other proceedings or matters. In addition, the Company also discloses matters based on its consideration of other matters and qualitative factors, including the experience of other companies in the industry, and investor, customer, and employee relations considerations. As of November 1, 2024, the Company does not believe there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss exceeding the amounts already accrued for these or other proceedings or matters has been incurred. However, since the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings and matters is inherently unpredictable, the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period by unfavorable outcomes in one or more of these proceedings or matters. Whether the outcome of any claim, suit, assessment, investigation, or legal proceeding, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows will depend on a number of factors, including the nature, timing, and amount of any associated expenses, amounts paid in settlement, damages, or other remedies or consequences. 
 
 Indemnifications Obligations 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into various contracts under which it may agree to indemnify other parties for losses incurred from certain events as defined in the relevant contract, such as litigation, regulatory penalties, or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments related to these indemnification obligations have not been material to the Company. 
 
 Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into with VMware, Inc. upon completion of the spin-off of VMware, Inc. on November 1, 2021 (the VMware Spin-off ), Dell Technologies agreed to indemnify VMware, Inc., each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, as well as any successors and assigns of the foregoing, from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to Dell Technologies as part of the separation of Dell Technologies and VMware, Inc. (currently operating under the name VMware LLC, and individually and together with its subsidiaries, VMware and their respective businesses (the Separation ). VMware similarly agreed to indemnify Dell Technologies Inc., each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers, and employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to VMware as part of the Separation. The amounts that VMware and Dell Technologies may be obligated to pay each other could vary depending on the outcome of certain unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for several years. Net income tax indemnification receivables from VMware were immaterial as of November 1, 2024 and February 2, 2024.

 on pre-tax income of billion compared to on pre-tax income of billion for the three months ended November 3, 2023. For the nine months ended November 1, 2024, the Company s effective income tax rate was on pre-tax income of billion compared to on pre-tax income of billion for the nine months ended November 3, 2023. The changes in the Company s effective income tax rate were primarily driven by discrete tax items. For the nine months ended November 1, 2024, the Company recorded discrete tax benefits of billion related to changes in uncertain tax benefits resulting from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and billion related to stock-based compensation. 
 
 The differences between the estimated effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 principally result from the geographical distribution of income, differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items, and discrete tax items. In certain jurisdictions, the Company s tax rate is significantly less than the applicable statutory rate as a result of tax holidays. The majority of the Company s foreign income subject to these tax holidays and lower tax rates is attributable to Singapore and China. A significant portion of these income tax benefits relates to a tax holiday that will be effective until January 31, 2029. Most of the Company s other tax holidays will expire in whole or in part during fiscal years 2030 and 2031. Many of these tax holidays and reduced tax rates may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met or as a result of changes in tax legislation. As of November 1, 2024, the Company was not aware of any matters of non-compliance related to these tax holidays. 
 
 In June 2023, the Company received a Revenue Agent s Report for the federal income tax examination by the Internal Revenue Service IRS of fiscal years 2018 through 2019. The IRS proposed adjustments primarily relating to certain transactions the Company completed as part of its business integration efforts. In August 2023, the Company submitted a written protest to the IRS relating to certain assessments. The Company received a rebuttal from the IRS to its written protest in April 2024. The Company disagrees with the IRS s proposed adjustments and will contest them through the IRS administrative appeals procedures. The Company anticipates that the appeals process for the resolution of these matters will extend beyond the next twelve months. In September 2023, the IRS commenced a federal income tax examination of fiscal years 2020 through 2022. 
 
 The Company is also currently under income tax audits in various U.S. state and foreign taxing jurisdictions. The Company is undergoing negotiations, and in some cases contested proceedings, relating to tax matters with the taxing authorities in these jurisdictions. With respect to major U.S. state and foreign taxing jurisdictions, the Company is generally not subject to tax examinations for years prior to the fiscal year ended January 29, 2010. The Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves related to all matters contained in tax periods open to examination, including the IRS audits described above. 
 
 Although the Company believes it has made adequate provisions for the uncertainties with respect to these audits, should the Company experience unfavorable outcomes, such outcomes could have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
 
 Judgment is required in evaluating the Company s uncertain tax positions and determining the Company s provision for income taxes. Unrecognized tax benefits were billion and billion as of November 1, 2024 and February 2, 2024, respectively, and are included in other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company does not anticipate a significant change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 
 
 The Company takes certain non-income tax positions in the jurisdictions in which it operates and has received certain non-income tax assessments from various jurisdictions. The Company believes that a material loss in these non-income tax litigation matters is not probable and that it is not reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding amounts already accrued has been incurred. The Company believes its positions in these matters are supportable and that it ultimately will prevail in the matters. In the normal course of business, the Company s positions and conclusions related to its non-income taxes could be challenged and assessments may be made. To the extent new information is obtained and the Company s views on its positions, probable outcomes of assessments, or litigation change, changes in estimates to the Company s accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such a determination is made. In the resolution process for income tax and non-income tax audits, the Company is required in certain situations to provide collateral guarantees or indemnification to regulators and tax authorities until the matter is resolved.

INTRODUCTION 
 
 Company Overview 
 
 Dell Technologies is a global technology company that provides customers with a broad and innovative solutions portfolio to help customers modernize their information technology IT infrastructure, address workforce transformation, and provide critical solutions that keep people and organizations connected. With our extensive portfolio and our commitment to innovation, we offer secure, integrated solutions that extend from the edge to the core to the cloud, and we are at the forefront of artificial intelligence AI ), software-defined, and cloud native infrastructure solutions. Our vision is to become the most essential technology partner. We intend to realize our vision as we execute our strategy to leverage our strengths to extend our leadership positions and capture new growth. 
 
 We are organized into two business units which are also our reportable segments: Infrastructure Solutions Group and Client Solutions Group. 
 
 Infrastructure Solutions Group ISG ISG includes our storage, server, and networking offerings. Our comprehensive storage portfolio includes modern and traditional storage solutions, including all-flash arrays, scale-out file, object platforms, hyper-converged infrastructure, and software-defined storage. Our server portfolio includes high-performance general-purpose and AI-optimized servers. Our networking portfolio includes wide area network infrastructure, data center and edge networking switches, and cables and optics. ISG also offers software, peripherals, and services, including consulting and support and deployment. 
 
 Client Solutions Group CSG CSG includes offerings designed for commercial and consumer customers. Our CSG portfolio includes branded PCs, including notebooks, desktops, and workstations, branded peripherals, and third-party software and peripherals. CSG also includes services offerings, such as configuration, support and deployment, and extended warranties. 
 
 Our other businesses primarily consist of our resale of standalone offerings of VMware LLC (formerly VMware, Inc. and individually and together with its subsidiaries, VMware ), referred to as VMware Resale, and offerings of SecureWorks Corp. Secureworks ). In October 2024, Secureworks announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Sophos Inc., an affiliate of Thoma Bravo, L.P., a private equity and growth capital firm, will acquire Secureworks in an all-cash transaction for approximately 0.9 billion, subject to certain closing adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. Our other businesses are not classified as reportable segments, either individually or collectively.

Table of Contents 

For further discussion regarding our current reportable segments, see Results of Operations Business Unit Results and Note 16 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 
 
 We offer customers choice in how they acquire our solutions, including traditional purchasing and financing offerings provided by Dell Financial Services and its affiliates DFS ). We also offer flexible consumption models that include utility, subscription, and as-a-Service models. These offerings allow our customers to pay over time and provide them with operational and financial flexibility. For additional information about our financing arrangements, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 
 
 Business Trends and Challenges 
 
 During the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025, the following trends and conditions continued to affect the environment in which we operate: 
 
 Macroeconomic environment: The demand environment continued to remain strong for our servers and networking offerings, which resulted in overall net revenue growth. Additionally, we began to see modest demand improvement for our commercial offerings. 
 
 Demand for AI-optimized solutions: Our ISG business continued to benefit from increased demand for AI-optimized solutions as customers continue to adopt and further integrate AI into their operations. As a result of the continued strong demand for our AI-optimized servers, backlog levels for such offerings remained elevated as we exited the quarter. 
 
 Supply chain: Notwithstanding the increased demand for AI-optimized solutions, our supply chain continued to operate efficiently. We experienced an increase in input costs primarily driven by higher logistics costs, the effect of which was partially offset by favorability in component costs. Compared to the prior quarter, we began to observe an inflationary environment. Input costs primarily consist of both component and logistics costs. 
 
 Broadcom s acquisition of VMware: On November 22, 2023, Broadcom Inc. Broadcom completed its acquisition of VMware, leading to changes to our relationship with VMware as described below. 
 
 We expect the demand environment will continue to remain strong in our servers and networking offerings, which we expect will result in ISG net revenue growth across our AI-optimized and traditional servers for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2025. We expect modest CSG net revenue growth for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2025 depending on the timing of the anticipated PC refresh cycle and a competitive pricing environment. Additionally, we expect a continued reduction of our other businesses net revenue as we no longer act as a distributor of VMware s standalone products and services. 
 
 We expect input costs to increase during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2025, principally driven by anticipated inflation for component costs. Input cost trends are dependent on the strength or weakness of actual end-user demand and supply dynamics, which will continue to fluctuate and ultimately impact our costs, pricing, and operating results. 
 
 We remain focused on executing our key strategic priorities, building long-term value creation for our stakeholders, and addressing our customers needs while continuing to make prudent decisions in response to the environment. We look to balance profitability and growth while maintaining disciplined pricing as we navigate through competitive pricing pressures. 
 
 We continue to advance our own capabilities to change the way we work and make decisions, improve business outcomes and the customer experience, and reduce costs by leveraging new technology and optimizing business processes. We remain committed to disciplined cost management in coordination with our ongoing business transformation initiatives and will continue to take certain measures to reduce costs, including limitation of external hiring, employee reorganizations, and other actions to align our investments with our strategic priorities and customer needs. We anticipate these actions will result in a continued reduction in our overall headcount. We believe our unique operating advantages provide a foundation to foster growth, drive efficiencies, and continue to position us for long-term success.

 Relationship with VMware On November 22, 2023, VMware was acquired by Broadcom, and subsequently announced changes to its go-to-market approach for VMware offerings that impacted our commercial relationship with VMware. On March 25, 2024, we terminated our Commercial Framework Agreement with VMware, which provided the framework under which we and VMware continued our commercial relationship following our spin-off of VMware on November 1, 2021. We no longer act as a distributor of Broadcom s VMware standalone products and services, though we will continue to support customers that have purchased resale offerings sold in prior periods. We continue to integrate and embed certain VMware products and services with select Dell Technologies offerings to end-users, such as through our VxRail solution. The results of such offerings are reflected within CSG or ISG, depending upon the nature of the underlying offering sold. 
 
 VMware was a related party until the date of its acquisition by Broadcom. The acquisition terminated the preexisting related party relationship with VMware such that no related party relationship exists with either Broadcom or VMware effective as of November 22, 2023. For more information regarding the impact of the Broadcom acquisition of VMware and our prior related party transactions with VMware, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 
 
 ISG We expect that ISG will continue to be impacted by the evolving nature of the IT infrastructure market and competitive environment. With our scale and strong solutions portfolio, we believe we are well-positioned to address the ongoing competitive dynamics and trends in technology and customer needs. Through our collaborative, customer-focused approach to innovation, we strive to deliver new and relevant solutions and software to our customers quickly and efficiently. We continue to focus on customer base expansion and the lifetime value of customer relationships. We anticipate that ISG will continue to benefit from technology advancements and customer interest in AI and we are well-positioned to capture growth and support our customers needs. 
 
 We expect that growth in data will continue to generate long-term demand for our storage solutions and services. Cloud native applications are expected to continue to be a key trend in the infrastructure market. We continue to expand our offerings in external storage arrays, which incorporate flexible, cloud-based functionality. We benefit from offering solutions that address software-defined storage, hyper-converged infrastructure, and modular solutions based on server-centric architectures. Our storage business is subject to seasonal trends, which may continue to impact ISG results. 
 
 CSG We participate in all segments of the PC market with a focus on commercial and high-end consumer computing devices, as we believe they represent the most stable and profitable markets. We anticipate that CSG will benefit from advances in AI over the long-term as customers will require PCs with the ability to run their complex AI workloads. 
 
 Competitive dynamics remain an important factor in our CSG business and continue to impact pricing and operating results. We are committed to our long-term CSG strategy and will continue to make investments to innovate across the portfolio. We expect that the CSG demand environment will be subject to seasonal trends as well as the timing of the anticipated PC refresh cycle. 
 
 Recurring Revenue and Consumption Models We expect that our flexible consumption models will further strengthen our customer relationships and provide a foundation for growth in recurring revenue. We define recurring revenue as revenue recognized that is primarily related to hardware and software maintenance, as well as operating leases, subscription, as-a-Service, and usage-based offerings. 
 
 Strategic Investments and Acquisitions As part of our strategy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic investments through our venture capital investment arm, Dell Technologies Capital, with a focus on emerging technology areas that are relevant to our business and that will complement our existing portfolio of solutions. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never have commercial value, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in the companies. In addition to these investments, we may also make disciplined acquisitions of businesses that advance our strategic objectives and accelerate our innovation agenda. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exposure We manage our business on a U.S. Dollar basis. However, we have a large global presence, generating approximately half of our net revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States during the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024. As a result, our operating results can be, and particularly in recent periods have been, impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We utilize a comprehensive hedging strategy intended to mitigate the impact of foreign currency volatility over time, and we adjust pricing when possible to further minimize foreign currency impacts. 

55 

Table of Contents 

 Other Macroeconomic Risks and Uncertainties The impacts of trade protection measures, including increases in tariffs and trade barriers, changes in government policies and international trade arrangements, geopolitical volatility, and global macroeconomic conditions (including those in China) may affect our ability to conduct business in some non-U.S. markets. We monitor and seek to mitigate these risks with adjustments to our manufacturing, supply chain, and distribution networks.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 In this management s discussion and analysis, we use supplemental measures of our performance which are derived from our consolidated financial information but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP product gross margin; non-GAAP services gross margin; non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP operating expenses; non-GAAP operating income; non-GAAP net income; non-GAAP earnings per share attributable to Dell Technologies Inc. - diluted; free cash flow; and adjusted free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance or liquidity in isolation from or as a substitute for gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share, or cash flows from operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. 
 
 We use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in financial planning and forecasting and when evaluating our financial results and operating trends and performance. We believe, when used supplementally with GAAP financial measures, these non-GAAP financial measures provide our investors with useful and transparent information to help them evaluate our results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our results of operations and enabling them to make period to period comparisons. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. 
 
 Non-GAAP product gross margin, non-GAAP services gross margin, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP earnings per share attributable to Dell Technologies Inc. - diluted, as defined by us, exclude amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, other corporate expenses and, for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share attributable to Dell Technologies Inc. - diluted, fair value adjustments on equity investments and an aggregate adjustment for income taxes. As the excluded items may have a material impact on our financial results, our management compensates for this limitation by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures supplementally or for projections when comparable GAAP financial measures are not available. 
 
 Reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented below. We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented. The discussion below includes information on each of the excluded items as well as our reasons for excluding them from our non-GAAP results. In future fiscal periods, we may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items. Accordingly, the exclusion of these items and other similar items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual. 
 
 The following is a summary of the items excluded from the most comparable GAAP financial measures to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures. 
 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets primarily consists of the amortization of customer relationships, developed technology, and trade names. In connection with our acquisition by merger of EMC, referred to as the EMC merger transaction, and the acquisition of Dell Inc. by Dell Technologies Inc., referred to as the going-private transaction, all of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of EMC and Dell Inc. and their consolidated subsidiaries, respectively, were accounted for and recognized at fair value on the transaction dates. We exclude amortization charges for the amortization of intangible assets as they do not reflect our current operating performance and charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and, as a result, may vary in amount from period to period. 
 
 Stock-based Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date. To estimate the fair value of performance-based awards containing a market condition, we use the Monte Carlo valuation model. For other share-based awards, the fair value is generally based on the closing price of the Class C Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, we exclude such expense because the fair value of the stock-based awards may fluctuate based on factors unrelated to the operating performance of the business and may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards. 
 
 57 

Table of Contents 

Other Corporate Expenses Other corporate expenses consist primarily of severance expenses, payroll taxes associated with stock-based compensation, transaction-related expenses, facility action costs, impairment charges, and incentive charges related to equity investments. Severance costs are primarily related to severance and benefits for employees terminated pursuant to cost management initiatives. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, we recognized 0.6 billion and 0.4 billion of severance expense related to workforce reduction activities. Transaction-related expenses typically consist of acquisition, integration, and divestitures related costs, primarily representing costs for legal, banking, consulting, and advisory services, and are expensed as incurred. Although we may incur these types of expenses in the future, we exclude other corporate expenses as they can vary from period to period, are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events, and are not used by management in assessing operating performance of the business. 
 
 Fair Value Adjustments on Equity Investments Fair value adjustments on equity investments primarily consist of the gain (loss) on strategic investments, which includes recurring fair value adjustments of investments in publicly-traded companies, as well as those in privately-held companies, which are adjusted for observable price changes and any potential impairments. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information on our strategic investment activity. We exclude fair value adjustments on equity investments given the volatility in ongoing adjustments to the valuation of these strategic investments and because such adjustments are unrelated to the operating performance of our business. 
 
 Aggregate Adjustment for Income Taxes The aggregate adjustment for income taxes is the estimated combined income tax effect for the adjustments described above and determined based on the tax jurisdictions where those adjustments were incurred, as well as an adjustment for discrete tax items. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, the aggregate adjustment for income taxes included discrete tax benefits of 0.4 billion related to changes in uncertain tax benefits resulting from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and 0.2 billion related to stock-based compensation. We exclude these benefits or charges for purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income due to the variability in recognition of discrete tax items from period to period. The tax effects are determined based on the tax jurisdictions where the above items were incurred. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information about our income taxes. Beginning in Fiscal 2025, our non-GAAP income tax is calculated using a fixed estimated annual tax rate which is determined based on historical trends and projections for the current fiscal year. We may adjust our estimated annual tax rate during the fiscal year to take into account events that would significantly impact our income tax expense, including significant changes resulting from tax legislation, material changes in geographic mix of revenue and expenses, changes to our corporate structure, and other significant events.

 In addition to the above measures, we use free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow as non-GAAP liquidity measures to evaluate our performance. As presented in the following table, we define free cash flow as cash flow from operations after excluding capital expenditures and capitalized software costs, net. To measure adjusted free cash flow, we exclude the impact of financing receivables and equipment under operating leases from free cash flow, as the initial funding of these DFS offerings at the time of origination is largely subsequently replaced with cash inflows from our DFS debt, the majority of which is asset-backed. 
 
 Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow provide useful information to management and investors in part because we use these metrics in our long-term capital allocation framework. Further, we believe free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are useful measures to management and investors because they reflect cash that we can use, among other purposes, to repurchase common stock, pay dividends on our common stock, invest in our business, pay down debt, and make strategic acquisitions. 
 
 As is the case with the other non-GAAP measures presented above, users should consider the limitations of using free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, including the fact that those measures do not provide a complete measure of our cash flows for any period. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow do not purport to be alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In particular, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management s discretionary use, as these measures do not reflect certain cash requirements, such as debt service requirements and other contractual commitments.

 Overview 
 
 During the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025, net revenue increased by 10 and 8 , respectively, driven by an increase in ISG net revenue that was partially offset by a decrease in other businesses net revenue and, to a lesser extent, CSG net revenue. The increase in ISG net revenue was driven by growth in our servers and networking offerings. Other businesses net revenue declined primarily due to a decrease in VMware Resale revenue as we no longer act as a distributor of standalone VMware offerings. The decline in CSG net revenue was attributable to a decrease in sales of our consumer offerings. 
 
 During the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, both operating income and non-GAAP operating income increased by 12 , to 1.7 billion and 2.2 billion, respectively. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, operating income and non-GAAP operating income increased by 6 to 3.9 billion and 3 to 5.7 billion, respectively. During both the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025, the increases in operating income and non-GAAP operating income were primarily attributable to an increase in ISG operating income driven by our servers and networking offerings, which was largely offset by a decrease in CSG operating income. 
 
 During the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, operating income and non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of net revenue increased 10 basis points to 6.8 and increased 20 basis points to 9.0 , respectively. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, operating income and non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of net revenue decreased 10 basis points to 5.5 and 40 basis points to 8.0 , respectively. Operating income and non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of net revenue during both the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025 were impacted by a decline in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue due to a shift in mix towards AI-optimized server offerings and a competitive CSG pricing environment. The decline in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was offset by the favorable impact of a decrease in operating expense rate that was driven by strong ISG net revenue growth coupled with continued disciplined cost management. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 3.9 billion during the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, and was driven by profitability, partially offset by working capital dynamics. Working capital was primarily impacted by AI dynamics, which led to higher inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable levels. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2024, cash provided by operating activities was 7.1 billion, which was primarily driven by profitability and working capital management as we reduced inventory, demonstrated strong cash collections performance, and benefited from the timing of purchases and payments to vendors. Cash provided by operating activities also reflected the impact of the 0.9 billion net payment to settle the Class V transaction litigation and 0.4 billion in proceeds from the sale of our U.S. consumer revolving customer receivables portfolio. See Liquidity, Cash Requirements, and Market Conditions for additional information about our cash flow metrics. 
 
 We continue to see opportunities to create value and grow as we respond to long-term demand for our IT solutions driven by a data- and AI-enabled world. We have demonstrated our ability to adjust to changing market conditions with complementary solutions and innovation across both segments of our business, an agile workforce, and the strength of our global supply chain. As we continue to innovate and modernize our offerings, we believe that Dell Technologies is well-positioned for long-term profitable growth. 
 
 Net Revenue 
 
 During the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025, net revenue increased 10 and 8 , respectively, primarily driven by an increase in ISG net revenue that was partially offset by a decrease in other businesses net revenue and, to a lesser extent, CSG net revenue. See Business Unit Results for further information. 
 
 Product Net Revenue Product net revenue includes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software licenses. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, product net revenue increased 13 due to an increase in ISG product net revenue driven by growth in our servers and networking offerings. The increase was partially offset by a decline in CSG product net revenue as a result of a decrease in units sold within our consumer offerings, as well as a decline in other businesses product net revenue as we no longer act as a distributor of standalone VMware offerings. 
 
 During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, product net revenue increased 11 due to an increase in ISG product net revenue driven by growth in our servers and networking offerings. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in CSG product net revenue as a result of a decrease in the average selling prices of our CSG offerings and, to a lesser extent, a decline in units sold within our consumer offerings, as well as a decline in other businesses product net revenue as we no longer act as a distributor of standalone VMware offerings.

Services Net Revenue Services net revenue includes revenue from our services offerings and support services related to hardware products and software licenses. During the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025, services net revenue increased 1 and 2 , respectively, driven primarily by growth within services net revenue attributable to CSG and, to a lesser extent, services net revenue attributable to ISG, partially offset by a decline in other businesses services net revenue. The increase in services net revenue was primarily attributable to CSG third-party software support and maintenance and, to a lesser extent, support and maintenance associated with products sold in prior periods within both ISG and CSG. Other businesses services net revenue declined as we no longer act as a distributor of standalone VMware offerings. 
 
 A substantial portion of services net revenue is derived from offerings that have been deferred over a period of time, and, as a result, reported growth rates for services net revenue will be different than reported growth rates for product net revenue. 
 
 From a geographical perspective, net revenue increased in the Americas and, to a lesser extent, the Asia Pacific and Japan APJ and Europe, the Middle East and Africa EMEA regions during the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. Net revenue increased in both the Americas and APJ and decreased in EMEA during the first nine months of Fiscal 2025. 
 
 Gross Margin 
 
 During the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, both gross margin and non-GAAP gross margin increased 3 , to 5.3 billion and 5.4 billion, respectively, driven by an increase in ISG gross margin that was largely offset by a decrease in CSG gross margin. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, both gross margin and non-GAAP gross margin decreased 1 , to 15.4 billion and 15.8 billion, respectively, driven by a decrease in CSG gross margin that was largely offset by an increase in ISG gross margin. The increase in ISG gross margin during both the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025 was primarily attributable to growth in our AI-optimized server offerings. The decrease in CSG gross margin during both the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025 was primarily attributable to a competitive pricing environment. 
 
 During the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, gross margin and non-GAAP gross margin percentage decreased 130 basis points to 21.8 and 140 basis points to 22.3 , respectively. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, gross margin and non-GAAP gross margin percentage decreased 200 basis points to 21.5 and 210 basis points to 22.1 , respectively. The decreases in gross margin percentage and non-GAAP gross margin percentage during both the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025 were primarily driven by a shift in mix towards AI-optimized server offerings and a competitive CSG pricing environment. 
 
 Product Gross Margin During the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, both product gross margin and non-GAAP product gross margin increased 2 , to 2.7 billion and 2.8 billion, respectively, primarily driven by an increase in ISG product gross margin that was largely offset by a decrease in CSG product gross margin. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, both product gross margin and non-GAAP product gross margin decreased 4 to 8.0 billion and 8.2 billion, respectively, primarily driven by a decrease in CSG product gross margin that was partially offset by an increase in ISG product gross margin. The increase in ISG product gross margin during both the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025 was primarily attributable to growth in our AI-optimized server offerings. The decline in CSG product gross margin during both the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025 was primarily attributable to a competitive pricing environment. 
 
 During the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, both product gross margin percentage and non-GAAP product gross margin percentage decreased 160 basis points, to 15.0 and 15.5 , respectively. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, product gross margin percentage and non-GAAP product gross margin percentage decreased 220 basis points to 15.0 and 240 basis points to 15.4 , respectively. The declines during both the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025 were primarily attributable to a shift in mix towards our AI-optimized server offerings and a competitive CSG pricing environment.

 Services Gross Margin During the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, services gross margin and non-GAAP services gross margin increased 4 to 2.6 billion and 5 to 2.6 billion, respectively. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, services gross margin and non-GAAP services gross margin increased 2 to 7.4 billion and 3 to 7.6 billion, respectively. During both the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025, services gross margin and non-GAAP services gross margin benefited from an increase in support and maintenance associated with products sold in prior periods within both ISG and CSG and, to a lesser extent, an increase CSG third-party software support and maintenance. 
 
 During the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, services gross margin percentage and non-GAAP services gross margin percentage increased 120 basis points to 42.1 and 160 basis points to 43.0 , respectively. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, services gross margin percentage and non-GAAP services gross margin percentage increased 10 basis points to 40.7 and 50 basis points to 41.8 , respectively. The increases in services gross margin percentage and non-GAAP services gross margin percentage were primarily driven by a shift in mix as we no longer act as a distributor of standalone VMware offerings. 
 
 Vendor Programs 
 
 Our gross margin is affected by our ability to achieve competitive pricing with our vendors and contract manufacturers, including through our negotiation of a variety of vendor rebate programs to achieve lower net costs for the various components we include in our products. Under these programs, vendors provide us with rebates or other discounts from the list prices for the components, which are generally elements of their pricing strategy. We account for vendor rebates and other discounts as a reduction in cost of net revenue. We manage our costs on a total net cost basis, which includes supplier list prices reduced by vendor rebates and other discounts. 
 
 The terms and conditions of our vendor rebate programs are largely based on product volumes and are generally negotiated either at the beginning of the annual or quarterly period, depending on the program. The timing and amount of vendor rebates and other discounts we receive under the programs may vary from period to period, reflecting changes in the competitive environment. We monitor our component costs and seek to address the effects of any changes to terms that might arise under our vendor rebate programs. Our gross margins for the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025 were not materially affected by any changes to the terms of our vendor rebate programs, as the amounts we received under these programs were generally stable relative to our total net cost. We are not aware of any significant changes to our vendor rebate programs that will materially impact our results in the near term.

 During the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025, total operating expenses decreased 1 and 3 , respectively, due to a decline in selling, general, and administrative expenses. 
 
 Selling, General, and Administrative During the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 3 and 6 , respectively, driven by a decrease in employee compensation and benefits expense, principally due to a decline in overall headcount. 
 
 Research and Development Research and development R D expenses are primarily composed of personnel-related expenses incurred in connection with product development. R D expenses increased 8 and 10 , respectively, during the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025, principally due to an increase in R D-related employee compensation and benefits expense. 
 
 As a percentage of net revenue, R D expenses for both the third quarter of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 were 3.1 and for both the first nine months of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 were 3.2 . We continue to support R D initiatives to innovate and introduce new and enhanced solutions into the market. 
 
 During the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 2 and 3 , respectively, driven by a decline in employee compensation and benefits expense, primarily resulting from a decline in overall headcount. The decline in employee compensation and benefits expense was partially offset by continued support of R D initiatives. 
 
 We continue to make strategic investments designed to enable growth and innovation, while balancing our efforts to drive cost efficiencies in the business. We also expect to continue making investments in support of our own digital transformation, which aims to streamline and optimize our business processes.

For the first nine months of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, our effective income tax rate was 0.2 and 21.6 , respectively. The changes in our effective income tax rate were primarily driven by discrete tax items. For the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, we recorded discrete tax benefits of 0.4 billion related to changes in uncertain tax benefits resulting from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and 0.2 billion related to stock-based compensation. 
 
 Our effective income tax rate can fluctuate depending on the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings, as our foreign earnings are generally taxed at lower rates than in the United States. The differences between our effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 principally result from the geographical distribution of income, differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items, and discrete tax items. In certain jurisdictions, our tax rate is significantly less than the applicable statutory rate as a result of tax holidays. The majority of our foreign income subject to these tax holidays is attributable to Singapore and China. A significant portion of these income tax benefits relates to a tax holiday that will be effective until January 31, 2029. Most of our other tax holidays will expire in whole or in part during Fiscal 2030 and Fiscal 2031. Many of these tax holidays and reduced tax rates may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met or as a result of changes in tax legislation. As of November 1, 2024, we were not aware of any matters of non-compliance. 
 
 Many countries, including Singapore, a country in which we have a tax holiday, have enacted or are in the process of enacting laws based on the Pillar Two proposal relating to a global minimum tax issued by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD ). While we expect our effective income tax rate and cash income tax payments will increase in future years as a result of the global minimum tax, we do not expect the tax will have a material impact on our Fiscal 2025 consolidated results of operations. Our assessment could be affected by legislative guidance and future enactment of additional provisions within the Pillar Two framework.

 Net Income 
 
 During the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, net income and non-GAAP net income increased 12 to 1.1 billion and 11 to 1.5 billion, respectively, due to an increase in operating income. 
 
 During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, net income and non-GAAP net income increased 43 to 2.9 billion and 5 to 3.8 billion, respectively. Net income increased primarily due to a reduction in income tax expense and, to a lesser extent, an increase in operating income. Non-GAAP net income increased primarily due to an increase in operating income.

 The following table presents net revenue and operating income attributable to ISG for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended November 1, 2024 Change November 3, 2023 November 1, 2024 Change November 3, 2023 (in millions, except percentages) Net revenue: Servers and networking 7,364 58 4,656 20,502 61 12,767 Storage 4,004 4 3,843 11,739 11,786 Total ISG net revenue 11,368 34 8,499 32,241 31 24,553 Operating income: ISG operating income 1,508 41 1,069 3,528 23 2,858 of segment net revenue 13.3 12.6 10.9 11.6 
 
 Net Revenue During the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025, ISG net revenue increased 34 and 31 , respectively, driven by strength in our servers and networking offerings. 
 
 Net revenue from sales of servers and networking increased 58 and 61 , respectively, during the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025. The increase in servers and networking net revenue was driven by growth in our AI-optimized server offerings and, to a lesser extent, our traditional server and networking offerings. 
 
 Storage net revenue increased 4 and remained flat, respectively, during the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, storage net revenue increased primarily due to an increase in net revenue of our hyper-converged infrastructure offerings. 
 
 From a geographical perspective, net revenue attributable to ISG increased in the Americas and, to a lesser extent, in APJ and EMEA during the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025. 
 
 Operating Income During the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, ISG operating income as a percentage of net revenue increased 70 basis points to 13.3 , due to a decline in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue that outpaced the decline in gross margin rate. Operating expense as a percentage of net revenue declined due to strong ISG net revenue growth coupled with continued disciplined cost management. Gross margin rate decreased primarily as the result of a shift in mix towards AI-optimized server offerings. 
 
 During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, ISG operating income as a percentage of net revenue decreased 70 basis points to 10.9 , due to a decline in gross margin rate that outpaced the decline in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue. Gross margin rate decreased primarily as the result of a shift in mix towards AI-optimized server offerings. Operating expense as a percentage of net revenue declined primarily due to strong ISG net revenue growth coupled with continued disciplined cost management.

 The following table presents net revenue and operating income attributable to CSG for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended November 1, 2024 Change November 3, 2023 November 1, 2024 Change November 3, 2023 (in millions, except percentages) Net revenue: Commercial 10,138 3 9,835 30,848 2 30,251 Consumer 1,993 (18) 2,441 5,664 (19) 6,950 Total CSG net revenue 12,131 (1) 12,276 36,512 (2) 37,201 Operating income: CSG operating income 694 (25) 925 2,193 (21) 2,786 of segment net revenue 5.7 7.5 6.0 7.5 
 
 Net Revenue During the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, CSG net revenue declined 1 primarily due to a decrease in units sold, partially offset by an increase in the average selling prices of our offerings. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, CSG net revenue declined 2 principally due to a decrease in units sold and, to a lesser extent, a decline in the average selling prices of our offerings. 
 
 Commercial net revenue increased 3 and 2 , respectively, during the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025, principally due to an increase in units sold. 
 
 Consumer net revenue decreased 18 and 19 , respectively, during the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025, principally due to a decline in units sold. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, consumer net revenue also declined as a result of a decline in the average selling prices of our consumer offerings. 
 
 From a geographical perspective, net revenue attributable to CSG decreased in APJ and EMEA and increased in the Americas during the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, net revenue attributable to CSG decreased in APJ and the Americas and increased in EMEA. 
 
 Operating Income During the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025, CSG operating income as a percentage of net revenue decreased 180 basis points to 5.7 and 150 basis points to 6.0 , respectively, primarily due to a decline in gross margin rate, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decline in gross margin rate was primarily the result of a competitive pricing environment. The decline in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to continued disciplined cost management.

 OTHER BALANCE SHEET ITEMS 
 
 Accounts Receivable 
 
 We sell products and services directly to customers and through a variety of sales channels, including retail distribution. Our accounts receivable, net, was 11.2 billion and 9.3 billion as of November 1, 2024 and February 2, 2024, respectively. Accounts receivable, net, was elevated due to growth in our AI-optimized server offerings and the timing of cash receipts. We maintain an allowance for expected credit losses to cover receivables that may be deemed uncollectible. The allowance for expected credit losses is an estimate based on an analysis of historical loss experience, current receivables aging, and management s assessment of current conditions and its reasonable and supportable expectation of future conditions, as well as specific identifiable customer accounts that are deemed at risk. As of November 1, 2024 and February 2, 2024, the allowance for expected credit losses was 62 million and 71 million, respectively. Based on our assessment, we believe that we are adequately reserved for expected credit losses. 
 
 Dell Financial Services and Financing Receivables 
 
 We offer or arrange various financing options and services for our customers globally, including through captive financing operations. DFS originates, collects, and services customer receivables primarily related to the purchase of our product, software, and services solutions. We further strengthen customer relationships through flexible consumption models, including utility, subscription, and as-a-Service models, which enable our customers the option to pay over time to provide them with financial and operational flexibility. New financing originations were 1.6 billion and 1.8 billion for the third quarter of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively, and 5.9 billion and 6.0 billion for first nine months of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively. 
 
 Our leases are generally classified as sales-type leases or operating leases. On commencement of sales-type leases, we recognize profit up-front, and recognize amounts due from the customer under the lease contract as financing receivables. Interest income is recognized as net product revenue over the term of the lease. Upon origination of operating leases, we record equipment under operating leases, classified as property, plant, and equipment, net. We recognize product revenue and depreciation expense, classified as cost of net revenue, over the contract term. 
 
 As of November 1, 2024 and February 2, 2024, our financing receivables, net were 10.9 billion and 10.5 billion, respectively . We maintain an allowance to cover expected financing receivables credit losses and evaluate credit loss expectations based on our total portfolio. The principal charge-off rate for our financing receivables portfolio was 1.4 and 0.6 for the third quarter of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively, and 0.8 and 0.6 for the first nine months of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively. The credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong due to the mix of high-quality commercial accounts in our portfolio. We continue to monitor broader economic indicators and their potential impact on future credit loss performance. We have an extensive process to manage our exposure to customer credit risk, including active management of credit lines and our collection activities. We also sell selected fixed-term financing receivables without recourse to unrelated third parties on a periodic basis, primarily to manage certain concentrations of customer credit exposure. Based on our assessment of the customer financing receivables, we believe that we are adequately reserved. 
 
 We retain a residual interest in equipment leased under our lease programs. As of November 1, 2024 and February 2, 2024, the residual interest recorded as part of financing receivables was 169 million and 157 million, respectively. The amount of the residual interest is established at the inception of the lease based upon estimates of the value of the equipment at the end of the lease term using historical studies, industry data, and future value-at-risk demand valuation methods. On a quarterly basis, we assess the carrying amount of our recorded residual values for expected losses. Generally, expected losses as a result of residual value risk on equipment under lease are not considered to be significant primarily because of the existence of a secondary market with respect to the equipment. Further, the lease agreement defines applicable return conditions and remedies for non-compliance to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return. No expected losses were recorded related to residual assets during the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024. 
 
 As of both November 1, 2024 and February 2, 2024, equipment under operating leases, net was 2.2 billion. We assess the carrying amount of the equipment under operating leases for impairment whenever events or circumstances may indicate that an impairment has occurred. No material impairment losses were recorded related to such equipment during the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024.

 DFS offerings are initially funded through cash on hand at the time of origination, most of which is subsequently replaced with asset-backed financing. For DFS offerings which qualify as sales-type leases, the initial funding of financing receivables is reflected as an impact to cash flows from operations and is largely subsequently offset by cash proceeds from financing. For DFS operating leases, the initial funding is classified as a capital expenditure and reflected as an impact to cash flows used in investing activities. 
 
 See Note 4 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information about our financing receivables and the associated allowances, and equipment under operating leases.

 LIQUIDITY, CASH REQUIREMENTS, AND MARKET CONDITIONS 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We rely on operating cash flows, which are impacted by trends in the demand environment, as our primary source of liquidity for our ongoing business operations. We monitor the efficiency of our balance sheet to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to support our business and strategic initiatives. 
 
 In addition to internally generated cash, we have access to other capital sources to finance our strategic initiatives and fund growth in our financing operations. Our strategy is to deploy capital from any potential source, whether internally generated cash or debt, depending on the adequacy and availability of that source of capital and whether it can be accessed in a cost-effective manner. 
 
 We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, together with cash that will be provided by future operations and borrowings and issuances expected to be available under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, respectively, will be sufficient over the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter to meet our material cash requirements, including funding of our operations, debt-related payments, capital expenditures, and other corporate needs. 
 
 As part of our overall capital allocation strategy, we intend to return capital to our stockholders through both share repurchase programs and dividend payments and use the remaining available cash to drive growth and maintain our investment grade credit rating. 
 
 The following table presents our cash and cash equivalents as well as our available borrowings as of the dates indicated: 
 November 1, 2024 February 2, 2024 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings: Cash and cash equivalents 5,225 7,366 Remaining available borrowings under the revolving credit facility 5,999 5,999 Total cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings 11,224 13,365 
 
 During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, cash and cash equivalents decreased by 2.1 billion primarily due to the return of capital to our stockholders, capital expenditures, net repayment of Senior Notes and DFS debt, and payments to settle employee tax withholdings on stock-based compensation, the effect of which was partially offset by cash flows from operations. 
 
 As of November 1, 2024, our revolving credit facility had a maximum capacity of 6.0 billion. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by draws on the facility and outstanding letters of credit. As of November 1, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility and remaining available borrowings totaled approximately 6.0 billion. The revolving credit facility also acts as a backstop to provide liquidity support for our commercial paper program. 
 
 We maintain a commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured notes in a maximum aggregate face amount of 5.0 billion outstanding at any time, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issue. As of November 1, 2024, we had no outstanding issuances under the program. 
 
 We may regularly use our available borrowings from the revolving credit facility and issuances under the commercial paper program, generally on a short-term basis, for general corporate purposes. See the following discussion for additional information about our debt.

 Debt 
 
 The following table presents our outstanding debt as of the dates indicated: 
 November 1, 2024 Change February 2, 2024 (in millions) Core debt Senior Notes 15,073 (534) 15,607 Legacy Notes 952 952 DFS allocated debt (2,263) (623) (1,640) Total core debt 13,762 (1,157) 14,919 DFS related debt DFS debt 9,171 (321) 9,492 DFS allocated debt 2,263 623 1,640 Total DFS related debt 11,434 302 11,132 Other 56 (115) 171 Total debt, principal amount 25,252 (970) 26,222 Carrying value adjustments (230) (2) (228) Total debt, carrying value 25,022 (972) 25,994 
 
 The outstanding principal amount of our debt decreased 1.0 billion to 25.3 billion as of November 1, 2024, driven primarily by net repayments of our Senior Notes and DFS debt. 
 
 We define core debt as the total principal amount of our debt, less DFS related debt and other debt. Our core debt was 13.8 billion and 14.9 billion as of November 1, 2024 and February 2, 2024, respectively. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information about our debt. 
 
 DFS related debt primarily represents debt from our securitization and structured financing programs. Our risk of loss under these programs is limited to transferred lease and loan payments and associated equipment, as the credit holders have no recourse to Dell Technologies. 
 
 To fund expansion of the DFS business, we balance the use of the securitization and structured financing programs with other sources of liquidity. We approximate the amount of our core debt used to fund the DFS business by applying a 7:1 debt-to-equity ratio to the sum of our financing receivables balance and equipment under operating leases, net. The debt-to-equity ratio is based on the underlying credit quality of the assets. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information about our DFS debt. 
 
 We believe we will continue to be able to make our debt principal and interest payments, including payment of short-term maturities, from existing and expected sources of cash, primarily from operating cash flows. Cash used for debt principal and interest payments may include short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program, our revolving credit facility, or other borrowings. Under our variable-rate debt, we could experience variations in our future interest expense from potential fluctuations in applicable reference rates, or from possible fluctuations in the level of DFS debt required to meet future demand for customer financing. 
 
 At our sole discretion, we may purchase, redeem, prepay, refinance, or otherwise retire any amount of our outstanding indebtedness under the terms of such indebtedness at any time and from time to time, in open market or negotiated transactions with the holders of such indebtedness or otherwise, as we consider appropriate in light of market conditions and other relevant factors.

 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table presents a summary of our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended November 1, 2024 November 3, 2023 (in millions) Net change in cash from: Operating activities 3,936 7,143 Investing activities (1,537) (2,114) Financing activities (4,424) (5,275) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (78) (200) Change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (2,103) (446) 
 
 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was 3.9 billion during the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, and was driven by profitability, partially offset by working capital dynamics. Working capital was primarily impacted by AI dynamics, which led to higher inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable levels. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2024, cash provided by operating activities was 7.1 billion, which was primarily driven by profitability and working capital management as we reduced inventory, demonstrated strong cash collections performance, and benefited from the timing of purchases and payments to vendors. Cash provided by operating activities also reflected the impact of the 0.9 billion net payment to settle the Class V transaction litigation and 0.4 billion in proceeds from the sale of our U.S. consumer revolving customer receivables portfolio. 
 
 Investing Activities Investing activities primarily consist of cash used to fund capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment inclusive of equipment under DFS operating leases and equipment used to support our as-a-Service offerings, which we refer to collectively as assets in a customer contract. Additional activities may include capitalized software development costs, acquisitions and divestitures, and the maturities, sales, and purchases of investments. Cash used in investing activities was 1.5 billion and 2.1 billion during the first nine months of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively, and was primarily applied to capital expenditures. 
 
 Financing Activities Financing activities primarily consist of the proceeds and repayments of debt and return of capital to our stockholders. Cash used in financing activities was 4.4 billion during the first nine months of Fiscal 2025 and primarily consisted of repurchases of common stock, inclusive of payments to settle employee tax withholdings on stock-based compensation, net repayments of our Senior Notes and DFS debt, and the payment of quarterly dividends. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2024, cash used in financing activities was 5.3 billion and primarily consisted of principal repayments of our Senior Notes, repurchases of common stock, inclusive of payments to settle employee tax withholdings on stock-based compensation, and the payment of quarterly dividends. 
 
 DFS Cash Flow Impacts DFS offerings are initially funded through cash on hand at the time of origination, most of which is subsequently replaced with asset-backed financing. For DFS offerings that qualify as sales-type leases, the initial funding of financing receivables is reflected as an impact to cash flows from operations and is largely subsequently offset by cash proceeds from financing. For operating leases, the initial funding is classified as a capital expenditure and reflected as cash flows used in investing activities. DFS new financing originations were 5.9 billion and 6.0 billion during the first nine months of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively. As of November 1, 2024, we had 10.9 billion of total net financing receivables and 2.2 billion of equipment under operating leases, net. 
 
 Supply Chain Finance Program We maintain a Supply Chain Finance Program (the SCF Program that enables eligible suppliers to sell receivables due from us to a third-party financial institution at the suppliers sole discretion. The SCF Program does not impact our liquidity, as payments by us to participating suppliers are remitted to the financial institution on the original invoice due date. Further, we negotiate payment terms with our suppliers regardless of their decision to participate in the SCF Program. Payments made under the SCF Program are included in cash flows from operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information regarding the SCF Program.

 Capital Commitments and Other Cash Requirements 
 
 Capital Expenditures We spent 1.9 billion and 2.0 billion during the first nine months of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively, on property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software development costs. Of total expenditures incurred, funding of assets in a customer contract totaled 1.0 billion and 0.9 billion during the first nine months of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively. Product demand, product mix, the use of contract manufacturers, and ongoing investments in operating and information technology infrastructure influence the level and prioritization of our capital expenditures. 
 
 Repurchases of Common Stock Effective as of September 23, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program with no fixed expiration date under which we are authorized to repurchase up to 5.0 billion of shares of our Class C Common Stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases. Effective as of October 5, 2023, the Board of Directors approved the repurchase of an additional 5.0 billion of shares of the Class C Common Stock with no fixed expiration date. Following the additional approval, we had approximately 5.7 billion in cumulative authorized amount remaining under the stock repurchase program. 
 
 During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025, we repurchased approximately 16 million shares of Class C Common Stock for a total purchase price of approximately 1.8 billion. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2024, we repurchased approximately 22 million shares of Class C Common Stock for a total purchase price of approximately 1.3 billion. 
 
 Dividend Payments On February 29, 2024, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a 20 increase in the dividend rate to 0.445 per share per fiscal quarter beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2025. During the first nine months of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, the Company paid 1.0 billion and 0.8 billion in dividends and dividend equivalents at a rate of 0.445 and 0.37 per share per fiscal quarter, respectively. 
 
 Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us. These obligations specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include contracts that may be canceled without penalty. 
 
 We utilize several suppliers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our products. Our efficient supply chain management allows us to enter into flexible and mutually beneficial purchase arrangements with our suppliers in order to minimize inventory risk. Consistent with industry practice, we acquire raw materials or other goods and services, including product components, by issuing to suppliers authorizations to purchase based on our projected demand and manufacturing needs. These purchase orders are typically fulfilled within 30 days and are entered into during the ordinary course of business in order to establish best pricing and continuity of supply for our production. Purchase orders are not included in purchase obligations, as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding purchase obligations. 
 
 As of November 1, 2024, the Company had purchase obligations of 8.1 billion, of which 6.9 billion was payable within 12 months.

 Market Conditions 
 
 We regularly monitor economic conditions and associated impacts on the financial markets and our business. We consistently evaluate the financial health of our supplier base, carefully manage customer credit, diversify counterparty risk, and monitor the concentration risk of our cash and cash equivalents balances globally. We routinely monitor our financial exposure to borrowers and counterparties. 
 
 We monitor credit risk associated with our financial counterparties using various market credit risk indicators such as credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies and changes in market credit default swap levels. We perform periodic evaluations of our positions with these counterparties and may limit exposure to any one counterparty in accordance with our policies. We monitor and manage these activities depending on current and expected market developments. 
 
 We use derivative instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures. We use forward contracts and purchased options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we primarily use forward contracts and may use purchased options to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information about our use of derivative instruments. 
 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our variable-rate debt portfolio. In the normal course of business we follow established policies and procedures to manage this risk, including monitoring of our asset and liability mix and the use of derivative instruments. As a result, we do not anticipate any material losses from interest rate risk.

 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 In connection with the preparation of this report, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 1, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of November 1, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We are in the process of an ongoing business transformation initiative to advance our capabilities, leverage new technology, and optimize business processes to change the way we work and make decisions, improve business outcomes, and reduce costs. As part of this initiative, we are modernizing accounting and finance systems. We have modified and will continue to modify the design and implementation of certain internal control processes to accommodate changes to our business processes and finance procedures, as our business transformation initiative continues. 
 
 There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended November 1, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
