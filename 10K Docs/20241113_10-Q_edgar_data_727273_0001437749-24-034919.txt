 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company had working capital of million at September 30, 2024 and used cash in its operations of million for the nine months September 30, 2024. The lower loss in 2024 was primarily due to a 2023 loss on early extinguishment of debt recorded in the amount of million resulting from issuance of a conversion instrument, a repayment fee and elimination of debt discount associated with the paydown of million of senior secured debt in 2023, and improved operating results for the water filtration technology business segment offset by higher compensation costs related to stock based non-cash bonus awards and increased interest expense related to the Third Amended Credit Agreement in 2024. 
 
 Cash requirements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflect certain operating and administrative costs related to the Company s land, water, infrastructure and technology assets for water solutions including the Mojave Groundwater Banking Project (formerly called the Cadiz Water Conservation Storage Project), ("Mojave Groundwater Banking Project" or Water Project ), agricultural operations and water filtration business. The Company s present activities are focused on the development of its assets in ways that meet a need for groundwater storage capacity in Southern California and growing demands for affordable, reliable, long-term water supplies in the Southwestern United States. 

On January 30, 2023, the Company completed the sale and issuance of shares of the Company s common stock to certain institutional investors in a registered direct offering January 2023 Direct Offering ). The shares of common stock were sold at a purchase price of per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of million and aggregate net proceeds of approximately million. A portion of the proceeds were used to repay the Company s debt in the principal amount of million, together with fees and interest required to be paid in connection with such repayment. 
 
 On February 2, 2023, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cadiz Real Estate LLC, as borrowers (collectively, the Borrowers entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement with BRF Finance Co., LLC Lenders and B. Riley Securities, Inc., BRS as administrative agent, to amend certain provisions of the Credit Agreement dated as of July 2, 2021 First Amended Credit Agreement ). Under the First Amended Credit Agreement, the lenders will have a right to convert up to million of outstanding principal, plus any PIK interest and any accrued and unpaid interest (the Convertible Loan into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of per share (the Conversion Price ). 
 
 On March 6, 2024, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to Credit Agreement and First Amendment to Security Agreement Third Amended Credit Agreement ). The Third Amended Credit Agreement provides, among other things, (a) a new tranche of senior secured convertible terms loans from HHC Fund 2012 Heerema in an aggregate principal amount of million, having a maturity date of June 30, 2027 New Secured Convertible Debt (b) the aggregate principal amount of the secured non-convertible term loans acquired by Heerema from an existing lender has been increased from million to million and the applicable repayment fee in respect thereof has been eliminated; (c) the Convertible Loan existing prior to the Third Amended Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount of approximately million plus interest accruing thereon, has become unsecured; and (d) extension of the maturity date for the existing Convertible Loan and non-convertible loans to June 30, 2027 see Note 3 Long-Term Debt , below). The proceeds from the Third Amended Credit Agreement will be used to fund expenditures associated with development of the Company s water supply projects, to fund working capital needs, to pay transaction related expenses and for general corporate purposes. 
 
 On November 5, 2024, the Company completed the sale and issuance of shares of the Company s common stock to certain institutional investors in a registered direct offering November 2024 Direct Offering ). The shares of common stock were sold at a purchase price of per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of million and aggregate net proceeds of approximately million. 
 
 The Company may meet its debt and working capital requirements through a variety of means, including extension, refinancing, equity placements, the sale or other disposition of assets, deferring the timing of preferred stock dividend payments (see Note 9 Common and Preferred Stock) or reductions in operating costs. The covenants in the senior secured debt do not prohibit the Company s use of additional equity financing and allow the Company to retain 100 of the proceeds of any common equity financing. The Company does not expect the loan covenants to materially limit its ability to finance its water solutions and agricultural development activities. 

Management assesses whether the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its costs for the next twelve months from each financial statement issuance date. Management evaluates the Company s liquidity to determine if there is a substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In the preparation of this liquidity assessment, management applies judgement to estimate the projected cash flows of the Company including the following: (i) projected cash inflows and outflows and their timing, (ii) categorization of expenditures as discretionary versus non-discretionary and (iii) the ability to raise capital. The cash flow projections are based on known or planned cash requirements for operating costs as well as planned costs for project development. 
 
 Limitations on the Company s liquidity and ability to raise capital may adversely affect it. Sufficient liquidity is critical to meet the Company s resource development activities. Although the Company currently expects its sources of capital to be sufficient to meet its near-term liquidity needs, there can be no assurance that its liquidity requirements will continue to be satisfied. If the Company cannot raise needed funds, it might be forced to make substantial reductions in its operating expenses, which could adversely affect its ability to implement its current business plan and ultimately its viability as a company. 
 
 Supplemental Cash Flow Information 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately in interest payments on the Company s senior secured debt was paid in cash and approximately was recorded as interest payable in kind. There are no scheduled principal payments due on the senior secured debt prior to its maturity. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, accruals for cash dividends payable on the Series A Preferred Stock was million (see Note 9 Common and Preferred Stock ). The cash dividends were paid on October 15, 2024. 
 
 The balance of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as shown in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows is comprised of the following: 

Restricted Cash 
 Long Term Restricted Cash 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

million senior secured credit agreement Credit Agreement ). Interest is paid quarterly at a rate of seven percent per annum. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company s assets on a first -priority basis.

 As a result of the issuance of the A and B Warrants, which met the criteria for equity classification under applicable GAAP, the Company recorded additional paid-in capital in the amount of million which was the fair value of the Warrants on the issuance date. In addition, the fair value of the Warrants was recorded as debt discount and was amortized over the term of the related debt. 
 
 On February 2, 2023, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement to amend certain provisions of the Credit Agreement First Amended Credit Agreement ). In connection with the First Amended Credit Agreement, the Company repaid million of the senior secured debt together with fees and interest required to be paid in connection with such repayment under the Credit Agreement.

In addition, the loss on early extinguishment of debt included million of repayment fees for both repaid and amended principal and thousand of unamortized debt issuance costs. 
 
 The fair value of the derivative liability was remeasured each reporting period using an option pricing model, and the change in fair value was recorded as an adjustment to the derivative liability with the change in fair value recorded as income or expense. On August 14, 2023, the Credit Agreement was further amended to remove a conversion exchange cap provision Second Amended Credit Agreement ). As a result of the Second Amended Credit Agreement, the Company reclassified the carrying value of the bifurcated conversion option at the time of the modification from a derivative liability in the amount of million to additional paid-in capital.

The Assignment was considered a debt extinguishment resulting in a gain of million recorded as additional paid-in-capital as Heerema is a significant shareholder of the Company. The acquired secured non-convertible term loans were issued to Heerema at a discount which is being amortized over the term of the non-convertible term loan.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as intends , anticipates , believes , estimates , projects , forecasts , expects , plans and proposes . Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. These include, among others, our ability to maximize value from our land and water resources and our ability to obtain new financings as needed to meet our ongoing working capital needs. See additional discussion under the heading Risk Factors in Item 1A as well as Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our forward-looking statements are made only as of the date hereof. We assume no duty to update these forward-looking statements to reflect new, changed or unanticipated events or circumstances, other than as may be required by law. 
 
 We are a water solutions provider with a unique combination of land, water, pipeline and water filtration technology assets principally located in Southern California between water systems serving population centers in the Southwestern United States. Our portfolio of assets includes 2.5 million acre-feet of water supply (permits complete), 220 miles of existing, buried pipeline, 1 million acre-feet of groundwater storage capacity, and versatile, scalable and cost-effective water filtration technology. 
 
 We manage our landholdings, groundwater supply, pipeline and water filtration technology assets to offer a suite of integrated products and services to public water systems, government agencies and commercial customers that include reliable water supply, water storage, water conveyance and custom-designed water filtration technology systems. 
 
 Water Supply We own vested water rights to withdraw 2.5 million acre-feet of groundwater at our property in the Cadiz Valley Cadiz Property or Cadiz Ranch for beneficial uses, including agricultural development on the Cadiz Property and to export to serve communities across Southern California. Because groundwater in the alluvium aquifer system beneath the Cadiz Property will continue to be lost to evaporation, surplus water that is captured and withdrawn before it evaporates is a new water supply conserved water). We have completed environmental review in accordance with local, state and federal laws authorizing the management of the groundwater aquifer underlying the Cadiz Property which is expected to produce an average of 50,000 acre-feet of water per year AFY for 50 years for beneficial use in Southern California communities. 
 
 Water Storage The aquifer beneath the Cadiz Property is part of a watershed estimated to contain 30-50 million acre-feet of groundwater already in storage and has been permitted for use as a water banking facility, capable of storing water in-lieu for supply customers and also up to 1 million acre-feet of imported surplus water for return during drought periods. For comparison, Lake Mead the largest surface reservoir in the United States can store up to 26 million acre-feet of water and is used by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California to store approximately 1.2 million acre-feet of surface water.

Water Conveyance Infrastructure We own an existing 220-mile 30-inch steel pipeline Northern Pipeline ), that intersects several water storage and conveyance facilities in Southern California, including the California Aqueduct, the Los Angeles Aqueduct, and the Mojave River Pipeline. We also own a 99-year lease with the Arizona California Railroad Company that will allow us to construct a 43-mile water conveyance pipeline Southern Pipeline within an existing, active railroad right-of-way that extends from the Cadiz Ranch to the Colorado River Aqueduct. The capacity of the Northern Pipeline for water conveyance is 25,000 AFY. The capacity of the Southern Pipeline ranges from 75,000 AFY to 150,000 AFY depending on the pipeline diameter (54-inch to 84-inch) selected to accommodate imported water storage. 
 
 Water Filtration Technology In 2022, we completed the acquisition of the assets of ATEC Water Systems, Inc. into ATEC Water Systems, LLC ATEC ), which provides innovative water filtration solutions for impaired or contaminated groundwater sources. ATEC s specialized filtration media provide cost-effective, high-rate of removal for common groundwater impairments and contaminants that pose health risks in drinking water including iron, manganese, arsenic, Chromium-6, nitrates, and other constituents of concern. 
 
 Our addition of pipeline infrastructure and ATEC water filtration technology to our portfolio of land and water assets enabled us in 2023 to adjust our business model to begin offering integrated services and solutions to public water systems that address the urgent challenges of climate change and make significant progress in advancing contract negotiations for water supply with public water systems. 
 
 In the first three quarters of 2024, we entered into agreements with multiple public water systems to purchase 21,275 AFY of annual water supply from us to be delivered via the Northern Pipeline. These agreements cumulatively represent approximately 85 of the full capacity (25,000 AFY) of the Northern Pipeline. 
 
 Through membership in Fenner Gap Mutual Water Company, a mutual water company to be owned by the participating water agencies, these agreements provide for delivery of purchased annual water supply over a 40-year term (take or pay), at an agreed upon market price estimated to start at approximately 850/AFY at the wellhead, subject to annual adjustment. In addition, participating public agencies are expected to fund costs of delivery of water from the Cadiz Property to their service area, and the capital costs for conversion of the Northern Pipeline from gas to water, including construction of pumping stations and appurtenant facilities. We anticipate that the capital costs would be funded by Newco as discussed below and could be eligible for public infrastructure funding and grants. Final agreements and facility construction are subject to standard environmental review and a project-level permitting process. 
 
 We have also executed Letters of Intent with communities in San Bernardino County reserving up to 100,000 acre-feet of surplus water over the life of the Water Project for the benefit of local disadvantaged communities as part of the Mojave-San Bernardino County One Water Project One Water launched by the Victor Valley Wastewater Reclamation Authority VVWRA ). Under the program, we would make surplus available at cost after all first priority contracts are served. The One Water partners will join efforts to access grants and funding to support Northern Pipeline development.

We estimate that it would cost approximately 800 million for the construction of the facilities required to deliver water supplies and fully operationalize our groundwater banking project in the Mojave Desert (the Mojave Groundwater Banking Project or Water Project ). In October 2024, we announced our intent to establish and manage a new entity, which is anticipated to be a limited partnership or limited liability company Newco ), with the participation of public sector or non-profit investors acting as limited partners to mobilize capital for the construction, ownership, and operation of the Mojave Groundwater Banking Project and its capital facilities in exchange for a share of revenues received by the Water Project. Newco is not expected to be a consolidating entity for accounting purposes with us. Newco partners are expected to contribute up to approximately 401 million to Newco and coordinate with us to seek available grant funding for remaining construction costs. Under the Newco structure, we would contribute our infrastructure assets, including the Northern Pipeline and the Southern Pipeline right-of-way and a share of the long-term cash flows from the groundwater banking operations to Newco in exchange for the capital funding provided by the limited partners In consideration of such transfer of assets, Newco is expected to pay us approximately 51 million upon closing of definitive agreements among other consideration and we would retain 49 of the water storage rights. Water supply purchase contracts entered into among us and public water providers will not be contributed to Newco. 
 
 We are expected to serve as the general partner or managing member of Newco. The distribution of profits from revenues anticipated to be received by Newco once the infrastructure is online would prioritize the Newco investors until they achieve an agreed annual yield with incremental distributions thereafter to us as the general partner/managing member, the investors and other Newco partners. 
 
 On October 30, 2024, we entered into a letter of intent (the LOI with a non-profit investment fund that is a beneficiary of a federal grant award and is dedicated to financing sustainable infrastructure projects (the Fund ). The LOI outlines the terms of a prospective investment by the Fund of up to 150 million as a limited partner in Newco subject to ongoing due diligence. We are in discussions with several additional potential qualified investors to fund all the capital required for Newco. 
 
 On November 10, 2024, we entered into an agreement that grants us an exclusive option to purchase 180 miles of existing 36-inch steel pipe expected to be utilized in the construction of the Mojave Groundwater Banking Project. This agreement has an initial two-year option term with a right to extend for up to an additional year through three 120-day extensions. We will make an initial payment of 5,000,000 to secure the option, with a 1,000,000 payment required for each extension. If the purchase option is exercised during the option term, we can acquire all or part of the pipeline assets at 155 per linear foot, with credits that could reduce the final purchase price depending on when the option is exercised. Additionally, we hold a right of first refusal to purchase the pipeline assets during the option term if the current owners receive a third-party offer for all or a portion of the remaining pipeline assets. 
 
 In October 2024, we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of RIC Energy to build a hydrogen production facility at the Cadiz Ranch. As part of this agreement, Cadiz plans to supply land via a lease agreement and sell water to RIC Energy for its hydrogen development. Once the facility is operational following the current anticipated 6-year developmental and construction stages, we will be able to access hydrogen and solar energy from the facility to power our water operations and explore the use of onsite natural gas pipelines to store and transport hydrogen.

ATEC and our agricultural operations provide our current principal source of revenue, although our working capital needs are not fully supported by these operations at this time. We believe that our water supply, storage, pipeline conveyance and treatment solutions will provide a significant source of future cash flow for the business and our stockholders. We presently rely upon debt and equity financing to support our working capital needs and development of our water solutions. 
 
 Our current and future operations also include activities that further our commitments to sustainable stewardship of our land, water, pipeline and water filtration technology assets, good governance and corporate social responsibility. We believe these commitments are important investments that will assist in maintenance of sustained stockholder value.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Current Financing Arrangements 
 
 As we have not received sufficient revenues or profits from our water, agriculture or water filtration technology activities to date, we have been required to obtain financing to bridge the gap between the time water resource and other development expenses are incurred and the time that revenue will commence. Historically, we have addressed these needs primarily through secured debt financing arrangements and private equity placements. 
 
 Equity Offerings 
 
 In January 2023, we completed the sale and issuance of 10,500,000 shares of our common stock to certain institutional investors in a registered direct offering January 2023 Direct Offering ). The shares of common stock were sold at a purchase price of 3.84 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of 40.3 million and aggregate net proceeds of approximately 38.5 million. A portion of the net proceeds were used to repay our debt in the principal amount of 15 million, together with fees and interest required to be paid in connection with such repayment. The remaining proceeds from the January 2023 Direct Offering were used for capital expenditures to accelerate development of water supply, storage, conveyance and treatment assets, working capital and development of additional water resources to meet increase demand on an accelerated timetable, and general corporate purposes. 
 
 On November 5, 2024, we completed the sale and issuance of 7,000,000 shares of our common stock to certain institutional investors in a registered direct offering November 2024 Direct Offering ). The shares of common stock were sold at a purchase price of 3.34 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of 23.4 million and aggregate net proceeds of approximately 21.9 million. 
 
 We intend to use the proceeds from the November 2024 Direct Offering to advance development of our water supply and groundwater banking project which may include acquisition of equipment and materials intended to be used in construction of facilities related to our northern and/or southern pipeline projects which we expect to begin in 2025. Net proceeds from the offering may also be used for the equipment and materials related to wellfield infrastructure on land owned by us and our subsidiaries, business development activities, other capital expenditures, working capital, and general corporate purposes. 
 
 Debt Offerings 
 
 In July 2021, we entered into a 50 million new credit agreement Credit Agreement (see Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Long-Term Debt ). The proceeds of the Credit Agreement, together with the proceeds from a depositary share offering, were used to (a) to repay all our outstanding senior secured debt obligations in the amount of approximately 77.6 million, (b) to deposit approximately 10.2 million into a segregated account, representing an amount sufficient to pre-fund eight quarterly dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock underlying depositary shares issued in a depositary share offering, and (c) to pay transaction related expenses. The remaining proceeds were used for working capital needs and for general corporate purposes.

On February 2, 2023, we entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement to amend certain provisions of the Credit Agreement First Amended Credit Agreement), Under the First Amended Credit Agreement, the lenders have a right to convert up to 15 million of outstanding principal, plus any PIK interest and any accrued and unpaid interest (the Convertible Loan into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 4.80 per share (the Conversion Price ). In addition, prior to the maturity of the Credit Agreement, we have the right to require that the lenders convert the outstanding principal amount, plus any PIK Interest and accrued and unpaid interest, of the Convertible Loan if the following conditions are met: (i) the average VWAP of our common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market, or such other national securities exchange on which the shares of common stock are listed for trading, over 30 consecutive trading dates exceeds 115 of the then Conversion Price and (ii) there is no event of default under certain provisions of the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Under the First Amended Credit Agreement, the maturity date of the Credit Agreement was extended from July 2, 2024, to June 30, 2026. 
 
 On March 6, 2024, we entered into a Third Amendment to Credit Agreement and First Amendment to Security Agreement Third Amended Credit Agreement with HHC Fund 2012 Heerema (see Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Long-Term Debt ). Before entering into the Third Amended Credit Agreement, Heerema purchased the outstanding secured non-convertible term loans under the Credit Agreement Assignment ). In connection with the Assignment, the existing holders of both the Convertible Loan and non-convertible term loans consented to effectuate the Third Amended Credit Agreement in consideration of a consent fee in the aggregate amount of 479,845 payable in the form of our common stock (valued at 2.89 per share, or 166,036 shares), which was registered pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and a prospectus supplement thereunder. The Third Amended Credit Agreement provides, among other things, (a) a new tranche of senior secured convertible terms loans from Heerema in an aggregate principal amount of 20 million, having a maturity date of June 30, 2027 New Secured Convertible Debt (b) the aggregate principal amount of the secured non-convertible term loans acquired by Heerema has been increased from 20 million to 21.2 million and the applicable repayment fee in respect thereof has been eliminated; (c) the Convertible Loan existing prior to the Third Amended Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount of approximately 16 million plus interest accruing thereon, has become unsecured; and (d) extension of the maturity date for the existing Convertible Loan and non-convertible loans to June 30, 2027. 
 
 The annual interest rate remains unchanged at 7.00 . Interest on 21.2 million of the remaining principal amount will be paid in cash. Interest on the aggregate 36 million principal amount of the New Secured Convertible Debt and existing Convertible Loan is paid in kind on a quarterly basis.

Limitations on our liquidity and ability to raise capital may adversely affect us. Sufficient liquidity is critical to meet our resource development activities. To the extent additional capital is required, we may increase liquidity through a variety of means, including equity or debt placements, through the lease, sale or other disposition of assets or reductions in operating costs. If additional capital is required, no assurances can be given as to the availability and terms of any new financing. 
 
 As we continue to actively pursue our business strategy, additional financing will continue to be required (see Outlook , below). The covenants in the Credit Agreement, as amended, do not prohibit our use of additional equity financing and allow us to retain 100 of the proceeds of any common equity financing. We do not expect the loan covenants to materially limit our ability to finance our water and agricultural development activities. 
 
 Cash Used in Operating Activities . Cash used in operating activities totaled 15.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 15.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash was primarily used to fund general and administrative expenses related to our water development efforts, agricultural development efforts, and our ATEC business including increased working capital needs related to accounts receivable and inventory offset by increased accounts payable. 
 
 Cash Used in Investing Activities . Cash used in investing activities totaled 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash used in the 2024 period primarily related to the development cost for the planting of 125 additional acres of alfalfa. The cash used in the 2023 period primarily related to the development of three new wells. 
 
 Cash Provided by Financing Activities . Cash provided by financing activities totaled 14.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with cash provided of 18.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Proceeds from financing activities for the 2024 period related to the issuance of long-term debt under the Third Amended Credit Agreement. Proceeds from financing activities for the 2023 period primarily related to the issuance of shares under direct offerings, offset by the paydown of 15 million of senior secured debt in February 2023. 
 
 Outlook 
 
 Short-Term Outlook. The net proceeds of approximately 21.9 million from the completion of the November 2024 Direct Offering, together with cash on hand, provide us with sufficient funds to meet our short-term working capital needs. Our ATEC operations are expected to be funded using existing capital and cash profits generated from operations during 2024. 
 
 Long-Term Outlook . In the longer term, we may need to raise additional capital to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures (see Current Financing Arrangements , above). Our future working capital needs will depend upon the specific measures we pursue in the entitlement and development of our water supply, storage, conveyance resources and other developments. Future capital expenditures will depend on the progress of the Water Project including the funding of Newco, ATEC operational needs and any further expansion of our agricultural assets, and ATEC operational needs.

We are evaluating the amount of cash needed, and the manner in which such cash will be raised, on an ongoing basis. We may meet any future cash requirements through a variety of means, including equity or debt placements, or through the sale or other disposition of assets. Equity placements will be undertaken only to the extent necessary, so as to minimize the dilutive effect of any such placements upon our existing stockholders. No assurances can be given, however, as to the availability or terms of any new financing. Limitations on our liquidity and ability to raise capital may adversely affect us. Sufficient liquidity is critical to meet our resource development activities.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
 conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
