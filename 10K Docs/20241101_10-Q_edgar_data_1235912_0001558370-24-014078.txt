 CVRx, Inc. Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q For the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy, clinical trial results, prospective products, product approvals, research and development costs, timing and likelihood of success, and the plans and objectives of management for future operations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, should, expect, plan, anticipate, could, intend, target, project, contemplate, believe, estimate, predict, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions and are based largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the important factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are summarized below, as updated in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise. Summary Risk Factors Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties when investing in our common stock. The principal risks and uncertainties affecting our business include, but are not limited to, the following: we have a history of significant losses, which we expect to continue, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability; our principal stockholders, management, and directors (two of whom are affiliated with our principal stockholders) own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval; we have a limited history operating as a commercial company and are highly dependent on a single product, Barostim, and the failure to increase market acceptance in the U.S. for Barostim would negatively impact our business, liquidity and results of operations;

Table of Contents 
 we have limited commercial sales experience marketing and selling Barostim, and if we are unable to continue to maintain and grow sales and marketing capabilities, we will be unable to generate sustained and increasing product revenue; we must continue to demonstrate to physicians and patients the merits of Barostim; if third-party payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for the use of Barostim, our revenue will be negatively impacted; our industry is highly competitive; if our competitors, many of which are large, well-established companies with substantially greater resources than us and have a long history of competing in the heart failure market, are better able to develop and market products that are safer, more effective, less costly, easier to use or otherwise more attractive than Barostim, our business will be adversely impacted; if we fail to receive access to hospitals, our sales may decrease; we are dependent upon third-party manufacturers and suppliers, and in some cases a limited number of suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages, loss or degradation in performance of the suppliers, price fluctuations and ongoing supply chain disruptions, which could harm our business; manufacturing risks may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our product and could reduce our gross margin and profitability; a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the U.S. or worldwide could adversely affect our business; we may face product liability claims that could be costly, divert management s attention and harm our reputation; we may in the future become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property or defend ourselves against intellectual property disputes, which could be expensive, time consuming and ultimately unsuccessful, and could result in the diversion of significant resources, thereby hindering our ability to effectively commercialize our existing or future products; if we fail to retain our key executives or recruit and hire new employees, our operations and financial results may be adversely affected while we attract other highly qualified personnel; and we will continue to obtain long-term clinical data regarding the safety and effectiveness of our products, which could impact future adoption and regulatory approvals.

As of September 30, 2024, the related weighted average period over which the expense is expected to be recognized is approximately years. On January 30, 2024, we amended the terms and conditions of certain stock option award agreements granted under the 2001 Plan and 2021 Plan between us and our former CEO in connection with his retirement, which occurred on February 11, 2024. The option agreements were amended to provide that, if not already vested at the time of termination of his employment due to retirement, the options will continue to vest on the previously scheduled vesting dates following his retirement, subject to his compliance with certain covenants. Additionally, the option agreements were modified so that the options may be exercised, to the extent vested, by our former CEO until the earlier of (a) following his retirement date, or (b) the applicable option expiration date. The modification of these option awards resulted in an additional million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. and , respectively.

The federal tax credit carryforwards began expiring in 2021 and the state tax credit carryforwards will begin expiring in 2028. Utilization of NOLs may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. We have not performed a detailed analysis to determine whether an ownership change has occurred. Such a change of ownership would limit our utilization of the NOLs and could be triggered by subsequent sales of securities by us or our stockholders.

Therefore, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same.

 business activity and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results or plans for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we have determined that we have a single reportable and operating segment structure. We and our Chief Executive Officer evaluate performance based primarily on revenue in the geographic locations in which the Company operates. Germany Other countries As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, long-lived assets were located primarily in the U.S. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are a commercial-stage medical device company focused on developing, manufacturing, and commercializing innovative and minimally invasive neuromodulation solutions for patients with cardiovascular disease. Our proprietary platform technology, Barostim, is designed to leverage the power of the brain and nervous system to address the imbalance of the Autonomic Nervous System, which causes HF with reduced Ejection Fraction HFrEF and other cardiovascular diseases. Our second-generation product, Barostim, is the first and only commercially available neuromodulation device indicated to improve symptoms for patients with HFrEF. Barostim provides Baroreflex Activation Therapy by sending imperceptible and persistent electrical pulses to baroreceptors located in the wall of the carotid artery to signal the brain to modulate cardiovascular function. Barostim is currently indicated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA for patients who are NYHA Class III or II (who had a recent history of Class III) despite treatment with guideline-directed medical therapies (medications and devices), have a LVEF 35 and a NT-proBNP Since our inception, our activities have consisted primarily of developing Barostim Therapy, conducting our BeAT-HF pre-market and post-market pivotal studies in the U.S., and filing for regulatory approvals. Our ability to generate significant revenue from product sales and become profitable will depend on our ability to continue to successfully commercialize Barostim and any product enhancements we may advance in the future. We expect to derive future revenue by continuing to both expand our own dedicated salesforce and increase awareness of Barostim among payers, physicians, and patients. Our sales and marketing efforts are directed at electrophysiologists, HF specialists, interventional and general cardiologists, and vascular surgeons because they are the primary users of our technology. However, we consider hospitals, where the procedures are performed primarily in an outpatient setting, to be our customers, as they are the purchasing entities of Barostim in the U.S. We intend to continue making significant investments building our U.S. commercial infrastructure by expanding and training our U.S. sales force. We have dedicated significant resources to educate physicians who treat HFrEF about the advantages of Barostim and train them on the implant procedure.

Table of Contents 
 The costs for the device and implantation procedure are reimbursed through various third-party payers, such as government agencies and commercial payers. In the U.S., we estimate that 67 of our target patient population is Medicare-eligible based on the age demographic of the HFrEF patient population indicated for Barostim. As a result, we have prioritized coverage by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services while simultaneously developing processes to engage commercial payers. All Medicare Administrative Contractors have retired their official automatic coverage denial policies for our Current Procedural Terminology codes, thereby allowing hospitals to submit payment requests for the Barostim procedure to be adjudicated on a claim-by-claim basis. Our reimbursement strategy involves continuing to broaden our current coverage and build our in-house market access team to obtain appropriate prior authorization approvals in advance of treatment on a case-by-case basis where positive coverage policies currently do not exist. Outside the U.S., reimbursement levels vary by country and within some countries by region. Barostim is eligible for reimbursement in certain countries in the European Economic Area, such as Germany, where annual healthcare budgets for the hospital generally determine the number of patients to be treated and the prices to be paid for the related devices that may be purchased. We manage all aspects of manufacturing operations and product supply of Barostim, which include final assembly, testing and packaging of our implantable pulse generator IPG and stimulation lead, at our headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. We utilize components or various subassemblies manufactured by third-party suppliers, some of which have significant lead times. Many of these components are from a limited number of suppliers. We believe that our component manufacturers are recognized in their field for their competency to manufacture the respective portions of Barostim and have quality systems established that meet FDA requirements. We seek to maintain higher levels of inventory to protect ourselves from supply interruptions and continue to seek to broaden and strengthen our supply chain through additional sourcing channels. From our inception until the IPO, we financed our operations primarily through preferred stock financings, and additionally, from sales of our Barostim products and amounts borrowed under our credit facilities. We then devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development activities related to Barostim Therapy, including clinical and regulatory initiatives to obtain marketing approval and sales and marketing activities. We used a portion of the IPO proceeds to continue funding the expansion of our direct sales force and commercial organization related to Barostim in the U.S. We have continued investing in research and development to improve clinical outcomes, optimize patient adoption and comfort, increase patient access, and enhance the physician and patient experience. Longer term, we plan to explore Barostim s potential to expand its indications for use to other cardiovascular diseases. On October 31, 2022, we entered into the Loan Agreement under which we may borrow, subject to our achievement of certain milestones, up to a total of 50.0 million in a series of Term Loans described in Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and we borrowed 7.5 million of such total on that date to fund our commercial and investment efforts. On March 10, 2023, we borrowed the 7.5 million remaining under the first tranche of the Loan Agreement. On December 15, 2023, we borrowed 15.0 million under the second tranche of the Loan Agreement. On September 30, 2024, we borrowed the remaining 20.0 million under the third and final tranche of the Loan Agreement. W e had 50.0 million in outstanding Term Loans under the Loan Agreement as of September 30, 2024. As a result of these investments and our commercialization efforts, we expect to continue to incur net losses for the next several years, which may require additional funding and could include future equity and debt financing. Recent developments In the 2024 final outpatient rules OPPS issued in November 2023, Barostim was reassigned to New Technology APC 1580, which carries an average payment amount of 45,000. The new payment took effect January 1, 2024. In July 2024, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS proposed OPPS rules for 2025, including moving Barostim procedures back to APC 5465, which would reduce the average payment amount for Barostim to 31,000. We believe the data supports creation of a Level 6 Neurostimulator 

 20 

Table of Contents 
 APC and will work with CMS with the goal of achieving this, or alternatively, leaving Barostim in New Technology APC 1580 for another year. In August 2024, we announced that CMS has reassigned the Barostim implant procedure for the inpatient setting as part of the Medicare Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System IPPS final rule for CMS Fiscal Year 2025, which began on October 1, 2024. On that date, Barostim was reassigned to MS-DRG 276, which carries a national average payment of approximately 43,000, a significant increase from the previous payment range of 17,000- 23,000, which is expected to facilitate increased access to the therapy for patients with heart failure. The American Medical Association's CPT Editorial Panel approved new Category I codes for Barostim therapy, effective January 1, 2026. Led by the Society for Vascular Surgery with support from the American College of Cardiology, this advancement from Category III to Category I status reflects Barostim's growing adoption and established clinical evidence in treating heart failure symptoms. The new designation is expected to streamline reimbursement processes and expand access to this important therapy for heart failure patients. Factors affecting our performance We believe there are several important factors that have impacted and that we expect will continue to impact our business and results of operations. These factors include: Growing and supporting our U.S. commercial organization; Seeking expanded labeling for Barostim and promoting awareness among physicians, hospitals and patients to accelerate adoption of Barostim; Raising awareness among payers to build upon reimbursement for Barostim; Investing in research and development to foster innovation; and Leveraging our manufacturing capacity to further improve our gross margins. 
 Components of results of operations Revenue Our U.S. sales have steadily increased since the pre-market approval of Barostim by the FDA in August 2019, and the subsequent reimbursement changes. We expect to continue to drive increases in revenue through our efforts to increase awareness of Barostim among physicians, patients and payers, and by the expansion of our U.S. sales force, as well as by seeking expanded labeling for Barostim. As a result, we expect that U.S. sales will continue to account for the majority of our revenue going forward. We derive a portion of our revenue from the sale of Barostim to hospitals in Germany and other select countries in Europe. Revenue from sales of Barostim in Europe fluctuates based on the average selling price of Barostim as determined by location of sale and channel mix, each of which may vary significantly from country to country. Our revenue from international sales can also be significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Cost of goods sold and gross margin Cost of goods sold consists primarily of acquisition costs of the components and subassemblies of Barostim, allocated manufacturing overhead and scrap and inventory obsolescence, as well as distribution-related expenses such as logistics and shipping costs. We expect cost of goods sold to increase in absolute dollars 

 21 

Table of Contents 
 primarily as, and to the extent, our revenue grows. Gross margin may also vary based on regional differences in rebates and incentives negotiated with certain customers. We calculate gross margin as revenue less cost of goods sold divided by revenue. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, but is primarily driven by the average sale price of our product, the percentage of products sold that include a full system (i.e., an IPG and a stimulation lead), as compared to individual IPG sales, and the allocated manufacturing overhead. Although we sell the majority of our devices directly to hospitals, the impact of the average selling price on gross margin is driven by the percentage of products we sold to distributors as compared to those sold directly to hospitals, as our average selling price is typically higher on products we sell directly. The full system sales typically have a lower gross margin as they include the cost of an IPG and a stimulation lead whereas individual IPG sales only include the cost of an IPG. The manufacturing overhead costs of Barostim are directly aligned to our production volume and therefore the cost per product is reduced if production levels increase. While we expect our gross margin to be positively affected over time to the extent we are successful in selling more product through our direct sales force and by increasing our production volumes, it will likely fluctuate from period to period as we continue to introduce new products and adopt new manufacturing processes and technologies. Research and development expenses Research and development R D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expenses for our R D employees. R D expenses also include costs associated with product design efforts, development prototypes, testing, clinical trial programs and regulatory activities, contractors and consultants, equipment and software to support our development, facilities, and information technology. We expense R D costs as they are incurred. We expect R D expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to develop enhancements to Barostim. Our R D expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and extent of our product development and clinical trial expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including base salaries, bonuses, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our sales and marketing personnel, including sales commissions, and for administrative personnel that support our general operations such as executive management, financial accounting, information technology and human resources personnel. SG A expenses also include costs attributable to marketing, as well as travel, legal fees, financial audit fees, insurance, fees for other consulting services, depreciation and facilities. We expense commissions at the time of the sale. We expect SG A expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our direct sales force and commercial organization in the U.S. In addition, we will continue to increase our international presence and to develop and assist our channel partners. However, we expect our SG A expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue as our revenue grows. Interest expense Interest expense consists of interest on our debt and amortization of associated financing costs. Other income, net Other income, net consists primarily of interest income on our interest-bearing accounts, partially offset by the effect of exchange rates on our foreign currency-denominated asset and liability balances.

 Research and development expenses R D expenses decreased 1.1 million, or 11 , to 8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was driven by a 0.7 million decrease in consulting expenses, a 0.1 million decrease in travel expenses, a 0.1 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and a 0.1 million decrease in compensation expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A expenses increased 23.6 million, or 50 , to 71.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily driven by an 11.7 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, an 8.2 million increase in compensation expenses, mainly as a result of increased headcount, a 1.2 million increase in travel expenses, a 0.9 million increase in advertising expenses, and a 0.5 million increase in consulting expenses. Approximately 8.4 million of the increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense is related to the modification of stock options held by the former CEO in connection with his retirement in the first quarter of 2024 described in Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Interest expense Interest expense increased 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by the interest expense on higher levels of borrowings under the Loan Agreement entered into on October 31, 2022. Other income, net Other income, net increased 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by greater interest income on our interest-bearing accounts. Provision for income taxes Provision for income taxes was nominal for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Liquidity, capital resources and plan of operations We have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception, and we anticipate that we will incur significant losses for at least the next several years. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 100.2 million and 90.6 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net losses were 13.1 million and 9.0 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net losses were 49.3 million and 32.0 million, respectively. Our net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 31.1 million and 31.2 million, respectively. On October 31, 2022, we entered into the Loan Agreement under which we may borrow, subject to our achievement of certain milestones, up to a total of 50.0 million in a series of Term Loans described in Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and we borrowed 7.5 million of such total on that date to fund our commercial and investment efforts. On March 10, 2023, we borrowed the 7.5 million remaining under the first tranche of the Loan Agreement. On December 15, 2023, we borrowed 15.0 million under the second tranche of the Loan Agreement. On September 30, 2024, we borrowed the remaining 20.0 million under the third and final tranche of the Loan Agreement. We had 50.0 million in outstanding Term Loans under the Loan Agreement as of September 30, 2024.

 On November 4, 2022, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Piper Sandler Co., as agent, under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 50.0 million in an at-the-market or ATM offering, to or through the agent. In January 2024, we commenced this ATM offering and issued 2,382,139 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of 21.0 million under the ATM offering during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We have remaining capacity to issue and sell up to 29.0 million of additional shares of common stock under this ATM offering. Our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: our investment in our U.S. commercial infrastructure and sales forces; the degree and rate of market acceptance of Barostim and the ability for our customers to obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement; the costs of commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution; our R D activities for product enhancements and to expand our indications; the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; our need to implement additional infrastructure and internal systems; our ability to hire additional personnel to support our operations as a public company; and the emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments. 
 We believe that our existing cash resources together with cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our forecasted requirements for operating liquidity, capital expenditures and debt services for at least the next three years. If these sources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, or provide funding to execute or accelerate our growth strategies, however, we may seek to sell additional equity or enter into an additional loan agreement. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders would experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants further restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any such debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. Additional financing may not be available at all or may only be available in amounts or on terms that we do not deem to be favorable. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when needed to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may be required to delay the commercialization and marketing of Barostim.

Net operating assets consisted primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses to support the growth of our operations. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 31.2 million and consisted primarily of a net loss of 32.0 million and a change in net operating assets of 4.4 million, partially offset by a non-cash charge of 4.7 million related to stock-based compensation expense. Net operating assets consisted primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses to support the growth of our operations. Cash used in investing activities: Cash used in investing activities was 1.3 million and 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and consisted of purchases of property and equipment. Cash provided by financing activities: Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 42.0 million and consisted of 20.2 million related to proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the ATM offering, 20.0 million related to proceeds under the Loan Agreement, 1.6 million related to proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, and 0.4 million related to proceeds from the ESPP, partially offset by 0.2 million related to debt financing costs.

 Critical accounting policies and estimates For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the information in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical accounting policies and estimates" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. We have reviewed and determined that those critical accounting policies and estimates remain our critical accounting policies and estimates as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. JOBS Act accounting election The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies, which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult. Recent accounting pronouncements A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest rate risk The risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is primarily limited to our cash equivalents and debt issued under the Loan Agreement, which are carried at quoted market prices and the prime rate, respectively. We do not currently use or plan to use financial derivatives in our investment portfolio. Foreign currency exchange rate risk Portions of our revenue and operating expenses that are incurred outside the U.S. are denominated in foreign currencies and subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. To date, foreign currency transaction realized gains and losses have not been material to our condensed consolidated financial statements, and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to managing the risks relating to fluctuations in currency rates. Inflation risk Inflationary factors, such as increases in our cost of goods sold and operating expenses, may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain and increase our gross margin and selling and marketing and operating expenses as a percentage of our revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase as much as or more than these increased costs.

 Credit risk As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents were maintained with financial institutions which we believe have sufficient assets and liquidity to conduct their operations in the ordinary course of business with little or no credit risk to us; however, our cash balances were in excess of insured limits. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, refers to controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Changes in internal control over financial reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. Item 1A. Risk Factors For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the information in Part I, Item IA. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Other than the risk factors set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we fail to retain our key executives or recruit and hire new employees, our operations and financial results may be adversely affected while we attract other highly qualified personnel. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to retain our executive officers and other key employees and recruit and hire new employees. All of our executive officers and other employees are at-will employees, and therefore may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. In particular, we are highly dependent upon our management team, especially our President and Chief

 Executive Officer and the rest of our senior management. The replacement of key personnel involves significant time and costs, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and may harm our business. In addition, we do not carry any key person insurance policies that could offset potential loss of service under applicable circumstances. Transitions in executive leadership can adversely affect relationships with our customers, suppliers, and employees, make it difficult to attract and retain talent, and disrupt execution of our strategy, sales growth, and our efforts to enhance our operations. Additionally, such transitions can require significant payments to recruit and attract qualified employees to join our company and may involve severance payments to certain departing employees. Changes in key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as the new management becomes familiar with our business and establishes their team dynamic. For example, in February 2024, we appointed a new Chief Executive Officer who replaced our prior Chief Executive Officer, who had been in the role for 17 years. We experienced some disruption within the sales organization at the time of the Chief Executive Officer transition, which led to decreased productivity and higher salesforce turnover, as well as the termination of employment of our Senior Vice President of U.S. Sales. Since the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we have hired new leaders for sales, medical affairs, clinical, reimbursement and human resources, completing the expansion of the executive team. Accordingly, our future financial performance will depend on our ability to attract, motivate, integrate and retain our senior management and employees. In addition, many of our employees have become vested in a substantial amount of stock or number of stock options. Our employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly below the market price of our common stock. Although non-compete agreements are becoming more disfavored and, in some cases, banned, many executive officers and employees in the medical device industry are still subject to strict non-compete or confidentiality agreements with their employers. In addition, some of our existing and future employees are subject to confidentiality agreements with previous employers. Our competitors may allege breaches of and seek to enforce such non-compete agreements or initiate litigation based on such confidentiality agreements. Such litigation, whether or not meritorious, may impede our ability to attract or use executive officers and other key employees who have been employed by our competitors and may result in claims against us. If third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for the use of Barostim, our revenue will be negatively impacted. Medicare reimbursement levels are important to increasing adoption of Barostim because nearly two-thirds of the target patient population for Barostim is over the age of 65. On January 1, 2024, Barostim was reassigned to New Technology APC 1580, which carries an average payment amount of 45,000. In July 2024, CMS proposed OPPS rules for 2025, including moving Barostim procedures back to APC 5465, which would reduce the average payment amount for Barostim to 31,000. We believe the data supports creation of a Level 6 Neurostimulator APC and will work with CMS with the goal of achieving this, or alternatively, leaving Barostim in New Technology APC 1580 for another year. In August 2024, CMS reassigned the Barostim implant procedure for the inpatient setting as part of the IPPS final rule for CMS Fiscal Year 2025, which took effect on October 1, 2024. On that date, Barostim was reassigned to MS-DRG 276, which carries a national average payment of approximately 43,000, a significant increase from the previous payment range of 17,000- 23,000, which is expected to facilitate increased access to the therapy for patients with heart failure. Additionally, the American Medical Association's CPT Editorial Panel approved new Category I codes for Barostim therapy, expected to take effect January 1, 2026. Any future decline in the amount Medicare is willing to reimburse our customers for procedures using Barostim could make it difficult for new customers to adopt Barostim and could create additional pricing pressure for us, which could adversely affect our ability to invest in and grow our business. From time to time, physicians and hospitals have in the past experienced, and others may experience, delays in Medicare reimbursement, which have delayed or may delay their willingness to schedule additional Barostim procedures.
