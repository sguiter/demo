million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and had a working capital deficiency of million as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a working capital deficiency of million. The Company is dependent on future operating performance in order to generate sufficient cash flows in order to continue to run its businesses. Future operating performance is dependent on general economic conditions, as well as financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control, including the impact of the current economic environment, the spread of major epidemics (including coronavirus), increases in interest rates and other related uncertainties such as government-imposed travel restrictions, interruptions to supply chains, extended shut down of businesses and the impact of inflation. In order to more effectively manage its cash resources, the Company had, from time to time, increased the timetable of its payment of some of its payables, which delayed certain product deliveries from our vendors, which in turn delayed certain deliveries to our customers. If we are unable to (i) obtain additional liquidity for working capital, (ii) make the required minimum funding contributions to the defined benefit pension plan, (iii) make the required principal and interest payments on our outstanding 8 Limited convertible senior subordinated notes due 2012 (the Notes and 9 Subordinated debentures due 2012 (the Debentures ), (iv) repay our obligations under our Loan Agreement (hereinafter defined) with Unilumin and/or (v) repay our obligations under our loan agreements with Carlisle, there would be a significant adverse impact on our financial position and operating results. The Company continually evaluates the need and availability of long-term capital in order to meet its cash requirements and fund potential new opportunities. Due to the above, there is substantial doubt as to whether we will have adequate liquidity, including access to the debt and equity capital markets, to continue as a going concern over the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this Form 10-Q.

A contract entered into by the Company with a customer may contain both lease and maintenance services (either or both services may be agreed upon based on the individual customer contract). Maintenance services may consist of providing labor, parts and software maintenance as may be required to maintain the customer s equipment in proper operating condition at the customer s service location. The Company concluded the lease and maintenance services represent a series of distinct services and the most representative method for measuring progress towards satisfying the performance obligation of these services is the input method. Additionally, maintenance services require the Company to stand ready to provide support to the customer when and if needed. As there is no discernable pattern of efforts other than evenly over the lease and maintenance terms, the Company will recognize revenue straight-line over the lease and maintenance terms of service.

are as follows: remainder of 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and thereafter. Contract Balances with Customers Contract assets primarily relate to rights to consideration for goods or services transferred to the customer when the right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The contract assets are transferred to the receivables when the rights become unconditional. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no contract assets. The contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for contracts prior to the transfer of control to the customer and therefore revenue is recognized on completion of delivery. Contract liabilities are classified as deferred revenue by the Company and are included in customer deposits and accrued liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets . The following table presents the balances in the Company s receivables and contract liabilities with customers: Allowance for credit loss Net receivables Contract liabilities During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized the following revenues as a result of changes in the contract asset and the contract liability balances in the respective periods: Performance obligations satisfied in previous periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) - - - -

The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately , and of the remaining performance obligations over the next months, to months and or more months, respectively. Costs to Obtain or Fulfill a Customer Contract The Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining customer contracts. Capitalized commissions are amortized based on the transfer of the products or services to which the assets relate. Applying the practical expedient, the Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. These costs are included in General and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the associated products. When shipping and handling costs are incurred after a customer obtains control of the products, the Company also has elected to account for these as costs to fulfill the promise and not as a separate performance obligation. Shipping and handling costs associated with the distribution of finished products to customers are recorded in costs of goods sold and are recognized when the related finished product is shipped to the customer.

This segment includes the financial, government/private, gaming, scoreboards and outdoor advertising markets. The Digital product lease and maintenance segment includes worldwide revenues and related expenses from the lease and maintenance of both indoor and outdoor digital product signage. This segment includes the lease and maintenance of digital product signage across all markets. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience along with other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in formulating our bases for making judgements regarding the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent elsewhere. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting estimates are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024.

 Results of Operations 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The following table presents our Statements of Operations data, expressed as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 In thousands, except percentages Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 Revenues: Digital product sales 8,193 93.6 10,821 94.3 Digital product lease and maintenance 559 6.4 656 5.7 Total revenues 8,752 100.0 11,477 100.0 Cost of revenues: Cost of digital product sales 7,825 89.4 10,118 88.1 Cost of digital product lease and maintenance 287 3.3 331 2.9 Total cost of revenues 8,112 92.7 10,449 91.0 Gross profit 640 7.3 1,028 9.0 General and administrative expenses (3,146) (35.9) (2,889) (25.2) Operating loss (2,506) (28.6) (1,861) (16.2) Interest expense, net (450) (5.1) (521) (4.5) Gain on foreign currency remeasurement 48 0.5 1 - Pension expense (150) (1.7) (187) (1.6) Loss before income taxes (3,058) (34.9) (2,568) (22.3) Income tax expense (19) (0.3) (19) (0.2) Net loss (3,077) (35.2) (2,587) (22.5) 
 
 Total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.7 million or 23.7 to 8.8 million from 11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in Digital product sales. 
 
 Digital product sales revenues decreased 2.6 million or 24.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the non-recurrence of a couple large sales that were delivered in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Digital product lease and maintenance revenues decreased 97,000 or 14.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the continued expected revenue decline in the older outdoor display equipment rental bases acquired in the early 1990s. The financial services market continues to be negatively impacted by the current investment climate resulting in consolidation within that industry and the wider use of flat-panel screens for smaller applications. 
 
 Total operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 645,000 to 2.5 million from 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, principally due to the decrease in revenues and an increase in general and administrative expenses.

 Digital product sales operating loss increased 510,000 to 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 839,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the decrease in revenues and an increase in general and administrative expenses. The cost of Digital product sales decreased 2.3 million or 22.7 , primarily due to the decrease in revenues. The cost of Digital product sales represented 95.5 of related revenues in 2024 compared to 93.5 in 2023. This increase as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the loss of some manufacturing efficiencies due to the decrease in revenues. General and administrative expenses for Digital product sales increased 175,000 or 11.3 , primarily due to increases in employees expenses, marketing expenses and the accrual for credit losses, partially offset by decreases in consulting expenses and supplies. 

Digital product lease and maintenance operating income decreased 58,000 or 17.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the decrease in revenues. The cost of Digital product lease and maintenance decreased 44,000 or 13.3 , primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense. The cost of Digital product lease and maintenance revenues represented 51.3 of related revenues in 2024 compared to 50.5 in 2023. The cost of Digital product lease and maintenance includes field service expenses, plant repair costs, maintenance and depreciation. General and administrative expenses for Digital product lease and maintenance increased 5,000, primarily due to an increase in the accrual for credit losses. 

Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 77,000 or 5.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in audit and insurance expenses, partially offset by a decrease in employees expenses. 
 
 Net interest expense decreased 71,000 or 13.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in interest rates. 
 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.6 and 0.7 , respectively. Both the 2024 and 2023 tax rates are being affected by the valuation allowance on the Company s deferred tax assets as a result of reporting pre-tax losses.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The following table presents our Statements of Operations data, expressed as a percentage of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 In thousands, except percentages Three months ended September 30 2024 2023 Revenues: Digital product sales 2,491 93.5 3,933 95.0 Digital product lease and maintenance 174 6.5 209 5.0 Total revenues 2,665 100.0 4,142 100.0 Cost of revenues: Cost of digital product sales 2,326 87.3 3,698 89.3 Cost of digital product lease and maintenance 88 3.3 111 2.7 Total cost of revenues 2,414 90.6 3,809 92.0 Gross income 251 9.4 333 8.0 General and administrative expenses (956) (35.9) (995) (24.0) Operating loss (705) (26.5) (662) (16.0) Interest expense, net (161) (6.0) (183) (4.4) (Loss) gain on foreign currency remeasurement (28) (1.1) 60 1.5 Pension expense (50) (1.9) (62) (1.5) Loss before income taxes (944) (35.4) (847) (20.4) Income tax expense (6) (0.2) (7) (0.2) Net loss (950) (35.6) (854) (20.6) 
 
 Total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.4 million or 35.7 to 2.7 million from 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in Digital product sales. 
 
 Digital product sales revenues decreased 1.4 million or 36.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreased sales from the sports sector. 
 
 Digital product lease and maintenance revenues decreased 35,000 or 16.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the continued expected revenue decline in the older outdoor display equipment rental bases acquired in the early 1990s. The financial services market continues to be negatively impacted by the current investment climate resulting in consolidation within that industry and the wider use of flat-panel screens for smaller applications. 
 
 Total operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 43,000 or 6.5 to 705,000 from 662,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, principally due to the decrease in revenues, partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses. 

Digital product sales operating loss decreased 33,000 or 9.2 to 324,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 357,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the decrease in revenues. The cost of Digital product sales decreased 1.4 million or 37.1 , primarily due to the decrease in revenue. The cost of Digital product sales represented 93.4 of related revenues in 2024 compared to 94.0 in 2023. This decrease as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the increase of some cost saving measures that we have implemented, partially offset by the decrease in revenues. General and administrative expenses for Digital product sales decreased 103,000 or 17.4 , primarily due to decreases in consulting expenses and the accrual for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in employees expenses.

 Digital product lease and maintenance operating income decreased 12,000 or 12.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the decrease in revenues. The cost of Digital product lease and maintenance remained level, primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense. The cost of Digital product lease and maintenance revenues represented 50.6 of related revenues in 2024 compared to 53.1 in 2023. The cost of Digital product lease and maintenance includes field service expenses, plant repair costs, maintenance and depreciation. General and administrative expenses for Digital product lease and maintenance remained level. 
 
 Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 64,000 or 15.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in audit and employees expenses. 
 
 Net interest expense decreased 22,000 or 12.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in interest rates. 
 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.6 and 0.8 , respectively. Both the 2024 and 2023 tax rates are being affected by the valuation allowance on the Company s deferred tax assets as a result of reporting pre-tax losses. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Current Liquidity 
 
 The Company has incurred significant recurring losses and continues to have a significant working capital deficiency including being in default on several debt obligations. The Company recorded a loss of 3.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company had working capital deficiencies of 17.0 million and 13.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in the working capital deficiency was primarily affected by increases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and customer deposits, as well as decreases in inventories, receivables and cash. These changes were partially offset by an increase in prepaids and other assets. 
 
 The Company is dependent on future operating performance in order to generate sufficient cash flows in order to continue to run its businesses. Future operating performance is dependent on general economic conditions, as well as financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control, including the impact of the current economic environment, the spread of major epidemics (including coronavirus) and other related uncertainties such as government imposed travel restrictions, interruptions to supply chains, extended shut down of businesses and the impact of inflation. In order to more effectively manage its cash resources, the Company had, from time to time, increased the timetable of its payment of some of its payables, which delayed certain product deliveries from our vendors, which in turn delayed certain deliveries to our customers.

 There is substantial doubt as to whether we will have adequate liquidity, including access to the debt and equity capital markets, to continue as a going concern over the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this Form 10-Q. The Company continually evaluates the need and availability of long-term capital in order to meet its cash requirements and fund potential new opportunities. 
 
 The Company used cash of 99,000 from operating activities and generated cash of 437,000 from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively . The Company has implemented several initiatives to improve operational results and cash flows over future periods, including reducing head count, reorganizing its sales department and outsourcing certain administrative functions. The Company continues to explore ways to reduce operational and overhead costs. The Company periodically takes steps to reduce the cost to maintain the digital products on lease and maintenance agreements. 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased 109,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 276,000 at September 30, 2024 from 385,000 at December 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to cash used in operating activities of 99,000, purchases of equipment of 4,000 and payments of long-term debt of 5,000. The current economic environment has increased the Company s trade receivables collection cycle, and its allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, but collections continue to be favorable. 
 
 Under various agreements, the Company is obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts. These include payments under the Company s current and long-term debt agreements, pension plan minimum required contributions, employment agreement payments and rent payments required under operating lease agreements. The Company has both variable and fixed interest rate debt. Interest payments are projected based on actual interest payments incurred in 2024 until the underlying debts mature. Interest rates had increased in 2023 but have decreased in 2024 so the amounts the Company pays for interest may need to be adjusted based on future interest rate changes. 
 
 The following table summarizes the Company s fixed cash obligations as of September 30, 2024 for the remainder of 2024 and over the next four fiscal years: 

In thousands Remainder of 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Long-term debt, including interest 5,564 42 42 42 39 Pension plan payments 840 417 357 329 301 Estimated warranty liability 22 73 64 53 28 Operating lease payments 137 560 577 452 414 Total 6,563 1,092 1,040 876 782 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding 302,000 of Notes which matured as of March 1, 2012. The Company also had outstanding 220,000 of Debentures which matured on December 1, 2012. The Company continues to consider future exchanges of the Notes and Debentures, but has no agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any further such exchanges.

The Company may still seek additional financing in order to provide enough cash to cover our remaining current fixed cash obligations as well as providing working capital. However, there can be no assurance as to the amounts, if any, the Company will receive in any such financing or the terms thereof. The Company has no agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any such financings. To the extent the Company issues additional equity securities, it could be dilutive to existing shareholders. 
 
 For a further description of the Company s long-term debt, see Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Long-Term Debt. 
 
 Pension Plan Contributions 
 
 The expected minimum required pension plan contribution for 2024 is 840,000, of which no contributions have been made by the Company as of the date of this filing. See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Pension Plan for further details. 
 
 Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 
 
 The Company may, from time to time, provide estimates as to future performance. These forward-looking statements will be estimates and may or may not be realized by the Company. The Company undertakes no duty to update such forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements, including loss of market share through competition, introduction of competing products by others, pressure on prices from competition or purchasers of the Company s products, interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations, the impact of inflation, terrorist acts and war. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term debt. The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by the use of variable and fixed interest rate debt. The fair value of the Company s fixed rate long-term debt is disclosed in Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Long-Term Debt. Every 1-percentage-point change in interest rates would result in an annual interest expense fluctuation of approximately 22,000. In addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk mainly as a result of its investment in its Canadian subsidiary. A 10 change in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a currency remeasurement expense fluctuation of approximately 242,000, based on dealer quotes, considering current exchange rates. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and did not hold any derivative financial instruments at September 30, 2024.
