EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 of Brixmor Property Group Inc. and Brixmor Operating Partnership LP. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to the "Parent Company" or "BPG" mean Brixmor Property Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, and references to the "Operating Partnership" mean Brixmor Operating Partnership LP and its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "the Company," "Brixmor," "we," "our," and "us" mean the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, collectively. 
 The Parent Company is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") that owns 100 of the limited liability company interests of BPG Subsidiary LLC ("BPG Sub"), which, in turn, is the sole member of Brixmor OP GP LLC (the "General Partner"), the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of September 30, 2024, the Parent Company beneficially owned, through its direct and indirect interest in BPG Sub and the General Partner, 100 of the outstanding partnership common units (the "OP Units") in the Operating Partnership. 
 The Company believes combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership into this single report: 
 
 Enhances investors understanding of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole, in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 Eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation; and 
 Creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 Management operates the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership as one business. Because the Operating Partnership is managed by the Parent Company, and the Parent Company conducts substantially all of its operations through the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company s executive officers are the Operating Partnership s executive officers, and although, as a partnership, the Operating Partnership does not have a board of directors, we refer to the Parent Company s board of directors as the Operating Partnership s board of directors. 
 We believe it is important to understand the few differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. The Parent Company is a REIT, whose only material asset is its indirect interest in the Operating Partnership. As a result, the Parent Company does not conduct business itself other than issuing public equity from time to time. The Parent Company does not incur any material indebtedness. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of our assets. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by the Parent Company, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units, the Operating Partnership generates all capital required by the Company s business. Sources of this capital include the Operating Partnership s operations and its direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness. 
 Equity, capital, and non-controlling interests are the primary areas of difference between the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent Company and those of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership s capital currently includes OP Units owned by the Parent Company through BPG Sub and the General Partner and has in the past, and may in the future, include OP Units owned by third parties. OP Units owned by third parties, if any, are accounted for outside of equity in non-controlling interests in the Parent Company s financial statements. 
 The Parent Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have material assets other than its indirect interest in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, while equity, capital, and non-controlling interests may differ as discussed above, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are materially the same on their respective financial statements. 
 In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, there are sections of this report that separately discuss the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, including separate financial statements (but combined footnotes), separate controls and procedures sections, separate certification of periodic report under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and separate certification pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350 as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In the sections that combine disclosure for the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company.

Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). These statements include, but are not limited to, statements related to our expectations regarding the performance of our business, our financial results, our liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "outlook," "believes," "expects," "potential," "continues," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "projects," "predicts," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "anticipates," or the negative version of these words or other comparable words. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. We believe these factors include but are not limited to those described under the section entitled "Risk Factors" in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in this report, as such factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), which are accessible on the SEC s website at https://www.sec.gov. These factors include (1) changes in national, regional, and local economies, due to global events such as international military conflicts, international trade disputes, a foreign debt crisis, foreign currency volatility, or due to domestic issues, such as government policies and regulations, tariffs, energy prices, market dynamics, general economic contractions, rising interest rates, inflation, unemployment, or limited growth in consumer income or spending; (2) local real estate market conditions, including an oversupply of space in, or a reduction in demand for, properties similar to those in our Portfolio (defined hereafter); (3) competition from other available properties and e-commerce; (4) disruption and/or consolidation in the retail sector, the financial stability of our tenants, and the overall financial condition of large retailing companies, including their ability to pay rent and/or expense reimbursements that are due to us; (5) in the case of percentage rents, the sales volumes of our tenants; (6) increases in property operating expenses, including common area expenses, utilities, insurance, and real estate taxes, which are relatively inflexible and generally do not decrease if revenue or occupancy decrease; (7) increases in the costs to repair, renovate, and re-lease space; (8) earthquakes, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, damage from rising sea levels due to climate change, other natural disasters, epidemics and/or pandemics, civil unrest, terrorist acts, or acts of war, any of which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses; and (9) changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment, and taxes. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this report and in our other periodic filings. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise, except to the extent otherwise required by law.

The Parent Company engages in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, disposition, and redevelopment of retail shopping centers through the Operating Partnership and has no other substantial assets or liabilities other than through its investment in the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, and their consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company" or "Brixmor") owns and operates one of the largest publicly traded open-air retail portfolios by gross leasable area ("GLA") in the United States ("U.S."), comprised primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers.

The Company s high-quality national Portfolio is primarily located within established trade areas in the top 50 Core-Based Statistical Areas in the U.S., and its shopping centers are primarily anchored by non-discretionary and value-oriented retailers, as well as consumer-oriented service providers.

 Non-Recurring Fair Value 
 Management periodically assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance, changes in anticipated hold period, and general market conditions, that the carrying value of the Company s real estate assets (including any related intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. Fair value is determined by offers from third party buyers, market comparable data, third party appraisals, or discounted cash flow analyses. The cash flows utilized in such analyses are comprised of unobservable inputs that include forecasted rental revenue and expenses based upon market conditions and future expectations. The capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in such analyses are based upon unobservable rates that the Company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective properties. Based on these inputs, the Company has determined that the valuations of these properties are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

 Executive Summary 
 Our Company 
 Brixmor Property Group Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, "BPG") is an internally-managed corporation that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Brixmor Operating Partnership LP and subsidiaries (collectively, the "Operating Partnership") is the entity through which BPG conducts substantially all of its operations and owns substantially all of its assets. BPG owns 100 of the limited liability company interests of BPG Subsidiary LLC ("BPG Sub"), which, in turn, is the sole member of Brixmor OP GP LLC (the "General Partner"), the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, "we," "our," and "us" mean BPG and the Operating Partnership, collectively. We own and operate one of the largest publicly traded open-air retail portfolios by gross leasable area ("GLA") in the United States ("U.S."), comprised primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio was comprised of 360 shopping centers (the "Portfolio") totaling approximately 63 million square feet of GLA. Our high-quality national Portfolio is primarily located within established trade areas in the top 50 Core-Based Statistical Areas in the U.S., and our shopping centers are primarily anchored by non-discretionary and value-oriented retailers, as well as consumer-oriented service providers. As of September 30, 2024, our three largest tenants by annualized base rent ("ABR") were The TJX Companies, Inc. ("TJX"), The Kroger Co. ("Kroger"), and Burlington Stores, Inc. ("Burlington"). BPG has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under U.S. federal income tax laws, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2011, has maintained such requirements through our taxable year ended December 31, 2023, and intends to satisfy such requirements for subsequent taxable years. 
 
 Our primary objective is to maximize total returns to our stockholders through consistent, sustainable growth in cash flow. Our key strategies to achieve this objective include proactively managing our Portfolio to drive internal growth, pursuing value-enhancing reinvestment opportunities, and prudently executing on acquisition and disposition activity, while also maintaining a flexible capital structure positioned for growth. In addition, as we execute on our key strategies, we do so guided by our purpose-driven Corporate Responsibility strategy. 
 
 We believe the following set of competitive advantages positions us to successfully execute on our key strategies: 
 
 Expansive Retailer Relationships We believe that the scale of our asset base and our nationwide footprint represent competitive advantages in supporting the growth objectives of the nation s largest and most successful retailers. We believe that we are one of the largest landlords by GLA to TJX, Kroger, and Burlington, as well as a key landlord to most major grocers and retail category leaders. We believe that our strong relationships with leading retailers afford us unique insight into their strategies and priority access to their expansion plans. 
 
 Fully-Integrated Operating Platform We manage a fully-integrated operating platform, leveraging our national scope and demonstrating our commitment to operating with a strong regional and local presence. We provide our tenants with dedicated service through both our national accounts leasing team based in New York and our network of three regional offices in Atlanta, Philadelphia, and San Diego, as well as our 11 leasing and property management satellite offices throughout the country. We believe that this structure enables us to obtain critical national market intelligence, while also benefiting from the regional and local expertise of our leasing and operations teams. 
 
 Experienced Management Senior members of our management team are seasoned real estate operators with extensive public company leadership experience. Our management team has deep industry knowledge and well-established relationships with retailers, brokers, and vendors through many years of operational and transactional experience, as well as significant capital markets capabilities and expertise in executing value-enhancing reinvestment opportunities.

Factors That May Influence Our Future Results 
 We derive our rental income primarily from base rent and expense reimbursements paid by tenants to us under existing leases at each of our properties. Expense reimbursements primarily consist of payments made by tenants to us for a portion of property operating expenses, such as common area expenses, utilities, insurance, and real estate taxes, and certain capital expenditures related to the maintenance of our properties. 
 
 Our ability to maintain or increase rental income is primarily dependent on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates, renew expiring leases, and/or lease available space. Increases in our property operating expenses, including repairs and maintenance, landscaping, snow removal, security, ground rent related to properties for which we are the lessee, utilities, insurance, real estate taxes, and various other costs, to the extent they are not reimbursed by tenants or offset by increases in rental income, will adversely impact our overall performance. 
 
 See Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the factors that could affect our rental income and/or property operating expenses.

 Rental income 
 The increase in rental income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 12.9 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, was due to a 14.3 million increase for assets owned for the full period, partially offset by a 1.4 million decrease due to net transaction activity. The increase for assets owned for the full period was due to (i) an 11.1 million increase in base rent; (ii) a 5.1 million increase in expense reimbursements; (iii) a 3.0 million increase in straight-line rental income, net; and (iv) a 0.3 million increase in lease termination fees; partially offset by (v) a 4.2 million decrease in rental income associated with revenues deemed uncollectible; (vi) a 0.6 million decrease in accretion of below-market leases, net of amortization of above-market leases and tenant inducements; (vii) a 0.3 million decrease in percentage rents; and (viii) a 0.1 million decrease in ancillary and other rental income. The 11.1 million increase in base rent for assets owned for the full period was primarily due to contractual rent increases, positive rent spreads for new and renewal leases and option exercises of 16.6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 15.3 during the year ended December 31, 2023, and an increase in weighted average billed occupancy. 
 
 Other revenues 
 The increase in other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.5 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, was primarily due to an increase in tax increment financing income.

 General and administrative 
 The increase in general and administrative costs of 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, was primarily due to one-time severance costs of 2.4 million associated with the realignment of the Company's regional operating structure, partially offset by a decrease in other net compensation costs.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We anticipate that our cash flows from the sources listed below will provide adequate capital for the next 12 months and beyond for all anticipated uses, including all scheduled payments on our outstanding debt, current and anticipated tenant and other capital improvements, stockholder distributions to maintain our qualification as a REIT, and other obligations associated with conducting our business. 
 
 Our primary expected sources and uses of capital are as follows: 
 Sources 
 cash and cash equivalent balances; 
 operating cash flow; 
 available borrowings under the Unsecured Credit Facility (defined hereafter); 
 issuance of long-term debt; 
 dispositions; and 
 issuance of equity securities. 
 
 Uses 
 debt repayments; 
 maintenance capital expenditures; 
 leasing capital expenditures; 
 dividend/distribution payments; 
 value-enhancing reinvestment capital expenditures; 
 acquisitions; and 
 repurchases of equity securities. 
 
 We believe our capital structure provides us with the financial flexibility and capacity to fund our current capital needs as well as future growth opportunities. We generate significant operating cash flow and have access to multiple forms of external capital, including secured property level debt, unsecured corporate level debt, preferred equity, and common equity, which will allow us to efficiently execute on our strategic and operational objectives. We have investment grade credit ratings from all three major credit rating agencies. Our unsecured credit facility as amended and restated April 28, 2022 (the "Unsecured Credit Facility") is comprised of a 1.25 billion revolving loan 
 35 

facility (the "Revolving Facility") and a 500.0 million term loan facility (the "Term Loan Facility"). As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.70 billion of available liquidity, including 1.25 billion available under our Revolving Facility and 452.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. We intend to continue to enhance our financial and operational flexibility through periodic extensions of the duration of our debt. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Our expected material cash requirements for the twelve months ended September 30, 2025 and thereafter are comprised of (i) contractually obligated expenditures; (ii) other essential expenditures; and (iii) opportunistic expenditures. 
 
 Contractually Obligated Expenditures 
 The following table summarizes our debt maturities (excluding extension options), interest payment obligations, and obligations under non-cancelable operating leases (excluding renewal options), as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in millions): 
 
 Contractually Obligated Expenditures Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2025 Thereafter Debt maturities (1) 
 632.3 4,718.5 Interest payments (1)(2) 
 205.8 887.0 Operating leases 5.7 42.1 Total 843.8 5,647.6 
 
 (1) Amounts presented do not assume the issuance of new debt upon maturity of existing debt. 
 (2) Scheduled interest payments for variable rate loans are presented using rates (including the impact of interest rate swaps), as of September 30, 2024. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact interest payments. 
 
 Other Essential Expenditures 
 We incur certain essential expenditures in the ordinary course of business, such as common area expenses, utilities, insurance, real estate taxes, capital expenditures related to the maintenance of our properties, leasing capital expenditures, and corporate level expenses. The amount of common area expenses, utilities, and capital expenditures related to the maintenance of our properties that we incur depends on the scope of services that we provide, prevailing market rates, and the size and composition of our Portfolio. We carry comprehensive insurance to protect our Portfolio against various losses. The amount of insurance expense that we incur depends on the assessed values of our properties, prevailing market rates, and the size and composition of our Portfolio. We incur real estate taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The amount of real estate taxes that we incur depends on the assessed values of our properties, the tax rates assessed by various jurisdictions, and the size and composition of our Portfolio. Leasing capital expenditures represent tenant specific costs incurred to lease or renew space, including tenant improvements, tenant allowances, and external leasing commissions. The amount of leasing capital expenditures that we incur depends on the volume and nature of leasing activity. We incur corporate level expenses such as employee compensation costs, professional fees, corporate office rents, and other platform expenses. The amount of corporate level expenses that we incur depends on the size and composition of our Portfolio and platform and prevailing market wages and rates. Leases typically provide for the reimbursement of property operating expenses such as common area expenses, utilities, insurance, and real estate taxes, and certain capital expenditures related to the maintenance of our properties. However, costs that we incur generally do not decrease if revenue or occupancy decrease, and certain costs that we incur, such as corporate level expenses, are not typically reimbursed. 

36 

In order to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must meet several organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. We intend to continue to satisfy these requirements and maintain our REIT status. Our board of directors evaluates our dividend on a quarterly basis, taking into account a variety of relevant factors, including REIT taxable income. The following table summarizes our dividend activity for the third and fourth quarters of 2024: 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Fourth Quarter 2024 Dividend declared per common share 0.2725 0.2875 Dividend declaration date July 24, 2024 October 23, 2024 Dividend record date October 2, 2024 January 3, 2025 Dividend payable date October 15, 2024 January 15, 2025 
 
 Opportunistic Expenditures 
 We also utilize cash for opportunistic expenditures such as value-enhancing reinvestment and acquisition activity. 
 
 The amount of value-enhancing reinvestment capital expenditures that we incur depends on a variety of factors that may change from period to period, such as the number, total expected cost, and nature of value-enhancing reinvestment projects that are underway. See Improvements to and investments in real estate assets below for further information regarding our in-process reinvestment projects and our pipeline of future redevelopment projects. 
 
 The amount of future acquisition expenditures depends on the availability of opportunities that further concentrate our Portfolio in attractive retail submarkets and optimize the quality and long-term growth rate of our asset base. Our acquisition strategy focuses on buying assets with strong growth potential that are located in our existing markets and will allow us to leverage our operational platform and expertise to create value. Our acquisition activity may include acquisitions of open-air shopping centers or non-owned anchor spaces, retail buildings, and/or outparcels at, or adjacent to, our existing shopping centers.

 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities is primarily impacted by the nature, timing, and magnitude of acquisition and disposition activity and improvements to and investments in our shopping centers, including capital expenditures associated with our value-enhancing reinvestment activity. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash used in investing activities increased 103.2 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase of 80.0 million in acquisitions of real estate assets; (ii) a decrease of 20.3 million in net proceeds from sales of real estate assets; (iii) an increase of 1.9 million in purchases of marketable securities, net of sales; and (iv) an increase of 1.0 million in improvements to and investments in real estate assets.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we expended 255.4 million and 254.4 million, respectively, on improvements to and investments in real estate assets. Included in these amounts are insurance proceeds of 4.5 million and 0.5 million, respectively, which were received during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Maintenance capital expenditures represent costs to fund major replacements and betterments to our properties. Leasing related capital expenditures represent tenant specific costs incurred to lease or renew space, including tenant improvements, tenant allowances, and external leasing commissions. In addition, we evaluate our Portfolio on an ongoing basis to identify value-enhancing reinvestment opportunities. Such initiatives are tenant driven and focus on upgrading our centers with strong, best-in-class retailers and enhancing the overall merchandise mix and tenant quality of our Portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, we had 43 in-process anchor space repositioning, redevelopment, and outparcel development projects with an aggregate anticipated cost of 506.8 million, of which 246.4 million had been incurred as of September 30, 2024. In addition, we have identified a pipeline of future redevelopment projects aggregating approximately 700 million of potential capital investment, which we expect to execute over the coming years. We expect to fund these projects with cash and cash equivalents, net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from sales of real estate assets, and/or proceeds from capital markets transactions. 
 
 Acquisitions of and proceeds from sales of real estate assets 
 We continue to evaluate the market for acquisition opportunities and we may acquire individual shopping centers or portfolios of shopping centers when we believe strategic opportunities exist, to further concentrate our Portfolio in attractive retail submarkets and optimize the quality and long-term growth rate of our asset base. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired three shopping centers and one land parcel for an aggregate purchase price of 81.9 million, including transaction costs and closing credits. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we acquired one land parcel for an aggregate purchase price of 1.9 million, including transaction costs and closing credits. 
 
 We may also dispose of properties when we believe value has been maximized, where there is downside risk, or where we have limited ability or desire to build critical mass in a particular submarket. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we disposed of five shopping centers, four partial shopping centers, and two land parcels for aggregate net proceeds of 140.0 million. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received aggregate net proceeds of 1.9 million related to land at one shopping center previously seized through 
 38 

eminent domain and resolved contingencies related to previously disposed assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we disposed of nine shopping centers and eight partial shopping centers for aggregate net proceeds of 161.9 million. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received aggregate net proceeds of 0.3 million related to a non-operating asset. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities is primarily impacted by the nature, timing, and magnitude of issuances and repurchases of debt and equity securities, as well as borrowings or principal payments associated with our outstanding indebtedness, including our Unsecured Credit Facility, and distributions made to our common stockholders. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased 523.3 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to (i) a 524.4 million increase in debt borrowings, net of repayments; and (ii) a 19.3 million increase in issuances of common stock; partially offset by (iii) an 11.7 million increase in distributions to our common stockholders; (iv) a 7.0 million increase in deferred financing costs; and (v) a 1.7 million increase in repurchases of common stock. 
 
 Non-GAAP Performance Measures 
 We present the non-GAAP performance measures set forth below. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) or other GAAP financial measures, as an indicator of financial performance and are not alternatives to, or more meaningful than, cash flow from operating activities (calculated in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity. Non-GAAP performance measures have limitations as they do not include all items of income and expense that affect operations, and accordingly, should always be considered as supplemental financial results to those calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our computation of these non-GAAP performance measures may differ in certain respects from the methodology utilized by other REITs and, therefore, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by such other REITs. Investors are cautioned that items excluded from these non-GAAP performance measures are relevant to understanding and addressing financial performance. 
 
 Funds From Operations 
 Nareit FFO (defined hereafter) is a supplemental, non-GAAP performance measure utilized to evaluate the operating and financial performance of real estate companies. Nareit defines funds from operations ("FFO") as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. 
 
 Considering the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we believe that Nareit FFO is useful to investors in measuring our operating and financial performance because the definition excludes items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating and financial performance, such as depreciation and amortization related to real estate, and items which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating and financial performance more difficult, such as gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets. 

39 

Our reconciliation of net income to Nareit FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts): 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income 96,840 63,736 255,870 232,390 Depreciation and amortization related to real estate 93,495 95,160 273,386 269,714 Gain on sale of real estate assets (37,018) (6,712) (53,974) (59,037) Impairment of real estate assets 5,863 11,143 17,836 Nareit FFO 159,180 152,184 486,425 460,903 Nareit FFO per diluted share 0.52 0.50 1.60 1.52 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 303,608 302,511 303,377 302,447 
 
 Same Property Net Operating Income 
 Same property net operating income ("NOI") is a supplemental, non-GAAP performance measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. Same property NOI is calculated (using properties owned for the entirety of both periods and excluding properties under development and completed new development properties that have been stabilized for less than one year) as total property revenues (base rent, expense reimbursements, adjustments for revenues deemed uncollectible, ancillary and other rental income, percentage rents, and other revenues) less direct property operating expenses (operating costs and real estate taxes). Same property NOI excludes (i) lease termination fees, (ii) straight-line rental income, net, (iii) accretion of below-market leases, net of amortization of above-market leases and tenant inducements, (iv) straight-line ground rent expense, net, (v) income or expense associated with our captive insurance company, (vi) depreciation and amortization, (vii) impairment of real estate assets, (viii) general and administrative expense, and (ix) other income and expense (including interest expense and gain on sale of real estate assets). 
 Considering the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we believe that NOI is useful to investors in measuring the operating performance of our portfolio because the definition excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to, or are not indicative of, the operating performance of our properties, such as lease termination fees, straight-line rental income, net, accretion of below-market leases, net of amortization of above-market leases and tenant inducements, straight-line ground rent expense, net, income or expense associated with our captive insurance company, depreciation and amortization, impairment of real estate assets, general and administrative expense, and other income and expense (including interest expense and gain on sale of real estate assets). We believe that same property NOI is also useful to investors because it further eliminates disparities in NOI by only including NOI of properties owned for the entirety of both periods presented and excluding properties under development and completed new development properties that have been stabilized for less than one year and therefore provides a more consistent metric for comparing the operating performance of our real estate between periods.

Inflation 
 We continue to monitor the impacts of inflation on our operating and financial performance. Although recent inflationary pressures have begun to abate, inflation may increase in the future. With respect to our shopping centers, our long-term leases generally contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation, including contractual rent escalations and requirements for tenants to pay a portion of property operating expenses, including common area expenses, utilities, insurance, and real estate taxes, and certain capital expenditures related to the maintenance of our properties, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in property operating expenses resulting from inflation; however, we have exposure to increases in certain non-reimbursable property operating expenses, including expenses incurred on vacant units. We believe that many of our existing rental rates are below current market rates for comparable space and that upon renewal or re-leasing, such rates may be increased to be consistent with, or closer to, current market rates, which may also offset certain non-reimbursed inflationary expense pressures. With respect to our outstanding indebtedness, we periodically evaluate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and have and may continue to enter into interest rate protection agreements that mitigate, but do not eliminate, the impact of changes in interest rates on our variable rate loans. With respect to general and administrative costs, we 
 41 

continually seek opportunities to offset inflationary cost pressures through routine evaluations of our spending levels and through ongoing efforts to utilize technology to enhance our operational efficiency.
