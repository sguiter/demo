FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

Except
for any historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q contain certain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. This includes statements regarding our future financial position,
economic performance, results of operations, business strategy, budgets, projected costs, plans and objectives of management for future
operations, and the information referred to under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations. 

These
forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as may, will, 
 expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, believe, continue 
or similar terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These forward-looking statements are not historical
facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management s beliefs and certain assumptions
made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, you are cautioned that
any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions
that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable
as of the date made, expectations may prove to have been materially different from the results expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ from projections include, for example: 

the
 success or failure of management s efforts to implement our business plan; 

our
 ability to fund our operating expenses; 

our
 ability to compete with other companies that have a similar business plan; 

the
 effect of changing economic conditions impacting our plan of operation; and 

our
 ability to meet the other risks as may be described in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 

Unless
otherwise required by law, we also disclaim any obligation to update our view of any such risks or uncertainties or to announce publicly
the result of any revisions to the forward-looking statements made in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

When
considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q
and in our other filings with the SEC. We cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q
will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may prove to be material.
In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation
or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified timeframe, or at all.

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read
in conjunction with our unaudited condensed financial statements, the accompanying notes thereto and other financial information appearing
elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. This section and other parts of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q contain forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Statements. 

Overview 

AG
Acquisition Group III, Inc. AG Acquisition Group III, we, us, our, or the Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived
advantages of being a publicly held corporation. We are an emerging growth company that is exempt from certain financial disclosure and
governance requirements for up to five years as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the JOBS
Act ), that eases restrictions on the sale of securities; and increases the number of shareholders a company must have before becoming
subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission s (the SEC reporting and disclosure rules. Our principal business
objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business
rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry
or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. 

Our
current activities are related to seeking new business opportunities. We will use our limited personnel and financial resources in connection
with such activities. It may be expected that pursuing a new business opportunity will involve the issuance of restricted shares of common
stock. At September 30, 2024, we had cash assets of 1,051 and total liabilities of 0. We have generated no revenues since inception. 

We
have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of
the JOBS Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public
and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not
be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

We
do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations
for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be paid with money in our treasury or with additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned
to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. 

During
the next 12 months, we anticipate incurring costs related to: 

(i) 
 Accounting
 and auditing fees relating to filing reports pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ),
 in the amount of approximately 20,000; and 

(ii) 
 Consummating
 an acquisition in the amount of approximately 100,000 or more, depending on the terms of the specific acquisition at issue to pay
 for audit fees, and the range of audit fees for this is unknown at such time and cannot be predicted with any accuracy. 

Our
officer and director, Laura Anthony, currently is providing legal services to the Company without charge. 

We
believe we will be able to meet the costs of filing reports under the Exchange Act during the next 12 months through the use of funds
to be loaned to or invested in us by our management or other investors. However, there is no guarantee that such additional funds will
be made available to us or on terms that are favorable to us. If we enter into a business combination with a target entity, we will request
the target company to pay the acquisition related fees and expenses as a condition precedent to such an agreement. Our management may
also agree to invest or loan money to cover such expenses. To date, we have had no discussions with our management or other investors,
regarding funding and no funding commitment for future expenses has been obtained. If in the future we need funds to pay expenses, we
will consider these and other yet to be identified options for raising funds and/or paying expenses. If our management, or other investors,
do not loan to or invest sufficient funds in us, then we will not be able to meet our SEC reporting obligations and will not be able
to attract a private company with which to combine. 

6 

We
have no source of revenues and will quickly have a stockholders deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. We are devoting our efforts to locating merger candidates. Our ability to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with another company, and ultimately,
achieve profitable operations. 

The
Company may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is in need of additional funds for expansion into new products
or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating
difficulties and is in need of additional capital. Our management believes that the public company status that results from a combination
with the Company will provide such company greater access to the capital markets, increase its visibility in the investment community,
and offer the opportunity to utilize its stock to make acquisitions. However, there is no assurance that the Company will have greater
access to capital due to its public company status, and therefore a business combination with an operating company in need of additional
capital may expose the Company to additional risks and challenges. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition
of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market
for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur
in a public offering. 

Management
believes there exist numerous private operating businesses seeking the perceived benefits of operating as a publicly registered corporation.
Perceived benefits may include increasing equity financing options, providing stock options or similar benefits as incentives to key
employees, and achieving liquidity (subject to restrictions of applicable statutes), for all shareholders. Management further believes
that certain private operating businesses prefer merging into a publicly registered company so as to eliminate the time and expense of
conducting an initial public offering. 

We
have, and will continue to have, no capital with which to provide the owners of business entities with any cash or other assets. However,
owners of these private operating businesses will still incur significant legal and accounting costs in connection with the acquisition
of a publicly registered corporation, including the costs of preparing Current Reports on Form 8-K, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q and agreements and related reports and documents. The Exchange Act specifically requires that within four business
days of completion of a merger or acquisition transaction with a private operating business, a Current Report on Form 8-K be filed containing
Form 10 information regarding the private operating company, including audited financial statements. 

Continuing
Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We
have no known demands or commitments and are not aware of any events or uncertainties as of the date of this report that will result
in or that are reasonably likely to materially increase or decrease our current liquidity. We had no material commitments for capital
expenditures as of September 30, 2024. 

The
Company s current cash is not sufficient to satisfy the Company s cash requirements during the next 12 months and additional
cash will be necessary. The Company currently plans to satisfy its cash requirements for the next 12 months through its current cash,
by borrowing from its stockholders and/or from stockholder contributions. The Company may explore alternative financing sources, although
it currently has not done so. However, there is no guarantee that such additional funds will be made available to us or on terms that
are favorable to us. If we enter into a business combination with a target entity, we will request the target company to pay the acquisition
related fees and expenses as a condition precedent to such an agreement. Our current stockholders may also agree to invest or loan money
to cover such expenses. To date, we have had no discussions with our stockholders or other investors regarding funding and no funding
commitment for future expenses has been obtained. If in the future we need funds to pay expenses, we will consider these and other yet
to be identified options for raising funds and/or paying expenses. If our current stockholders, or other investors, do not loan to or
invest sufficient funds in us, then we will not be able to meet our SEC reporting obligations and will not be able to attract a private
company with which to combine. 

The
Company will use its limited personnel and financial resources in connection with seeking new business opportunities, including seeking
an acquisition or merger with an operating company. It may be expected that entering into a new business opportunity or business combination
will involve the issuance of a substantial number of restricted shares of common stock. If such additional restricted shares of common
stock are issued, the shareholders will experience a dilution in their ownership interest in the Company. If a substantial number of
restricted shares are issued in connection with a business combination, a change in control may be expected to occur. 

7 

There
are no limitations in the certificate of incorporation on the Company s ability to borrow funds or raise funds through the issuance
of capital stock to effectuate a business combination. The Company s limited resources and lack of recent operating history may
make it difficult to borrow funds or raise capital. Such inability to borrow funds or raise funds through the issuance of capital stock
required to effect or facilitate a business combination may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition
and future prospects, including the ability to complete a business combination. To the extent that debt financing ultimately proves to
be available, any borrowing will subject the Company to various risks traditionally associated with indebtedness, including the risks
of interest rate fluctuations and insufficiency of cash flow to pay principal and interest, including debt of an acquired business. 

The
Company currently has no plans to conduct any research and development or to purchase or sell any significant equipment. The Company
does not expect to hire any employees during the next 12 months.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has reviewed
and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on such review
and evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required
by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
