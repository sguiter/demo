 of the equity interests in New Energy Capital Partners NEC ).

Revenue The Company s revenue includes fees earned from providing; investment management services,

 Revenue is recognized for each distinct performance obligation identified in customer contracts when the performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring services to a customer either over time or at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the service. Revenue is recognized in the amount of variable or fixed consideration allocated to the satisfied performance obligation that Victory expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring services to a customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only when it is probable that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Investment management, fund administration and fund distribution fees are generally considered variable consideration as they are typically calculated as a percentage of AUM. Fund transfer agent fees are also considered variable consideration

 of the purchase price of the Class C shares sold by the dealer or institution. When the Company makes an upfront payment to a dealer or institution for the sale of Class C shares, the Company capitalizes the cost of such payment, which is recorded in prepaid expenses in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortizes the cost over a 12-month period, the estimated period of benefit. Valuation of AUM and fund investments The fair value of assets under management of the Victory Funds and VictoryShares is primarily determined using quoted market prices or independent third-party pricing services or broker price quotes. In certain circumstances, a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service. In these cases, pricing is determined by management based on a prescribed valuation process that has been approved by the directors/trustees of the sponsored products. The same prescribed valuation process is used to price securities in separate accounts and the Company s other non-alternative investment vehicles for which a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service. The fair value of Level III assets held by alternative investment vehicles is determined under the respective valuation policy for each fund. The valuation policies address the fact that substantially all the investments of a fund may not have readily available market information and therefore the fair value for these assets is typically determined using unobservable inputs and models that may include subjective assumptions. AUM reported by the Company for alternative investment vehicles may not necessarily equal the funds net asset values or the total fair value of the funds portfolio investments as AUM represents the basis for calculating management fees. For the periods presented, less than one percent of the Company s total AUM were Level III assets priced without using a quoted market price, broker price quote or pricing service quotation. 

 million and million, respectively, was recorded in change in value of consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. NEC Acquisition Under the terms of the NEC purchase agreement, the Company will pay up to an additional million in cash based on NEC s net revenue growth over a period following the closing date. The purchase agreement specifies net revenue and payment targets for the -month, -month and -month periods beginning on November 30, 2021 (the Start Date for the contingent payments. It also provides for advance payments and catch-up payments to be made based on actual NEC net management fee revenue, as defined in the purchase agreement, as measured at the end of each 12-month anniversary of the Start Date over a six year period. The maximum amount of contingent payments, less any contingent payments previously paid, is due upon the occurrence of certain specified events within a five year period following the Start Date. The Company determined that substantially all of the contingent payments payable per the NEC purchase agreement represent compensation for post-closing services. The Company records compensation expense over the estimated service period in an amount equal to the total contingent payments currently forecasted to be paid. At September 30, 2024, the Company determined that the contingent payments are no longer probable of occurring and reduced the liability for NEC contingent payments to zero. The liability for NEC contingent payments totaled million as of December 31, 2023 which is included in accrued compensation and benefits in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net impact to the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations relating to the NEC contingent payment compensation expense was a decrease of million and million, respectively, in personnel compensation and benefits. Expense recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was million and million, respectively.

 million million per year) of contingent payments is payable to sellers. Contingent earn-out payments are based on net revenue of the WestEnd business during each of the first following the WestEnd Closing, subject to certain catch-up provisions over a five and one-half year period following the WestEnd Closing. The estimated fair value of contingent consideration payable to sellers was million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023, respectively. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company paid million in cash to sellers as a catch-up payment for the first earn-out period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in the liability was a decrease of million and an increase of million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the change in the liability was an increase of million and million, respectively. The impact of decreasing or increasing the valuation of the contingent consideration liability is recorded in change in value of consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated fair value of contingent consideration payable to sellers is estimated using the real options method. WestEnd net revenue growth is simulated in a risk-neutral framework to calculate expected probability-weighted earn out payments, which are then discounted from the expected payment dates at the relevant cost of debt. Significant assumptions and inputs include the WestEnd net revenue projected annual growth rate, the market price of risk adjustment for revenue, which adjusts the projected revenue growth rate to a risk-neutral expected growth rate, revenue volatility and discount rate. The market price of risk adjustment for revenue and revenue volatility are based on data for comparable companies. As the contingent consideration represents a subordinate, unsecured claim of the Company, the Company assesses a discount rate which incorporates adjustments for credit risk and the subordination of the contingent consideration. year average annual growth rate

There were transfers between any of the Level 1, 2 and 3 categories in the fair value measurement hierarchy from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The Company recognizes transfers at the end of the reporting period. The net carrying value of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these assets and liabilities. The fair value of our long-term debt as of September 30, 2024 is considered to be its carrying value as the interest rate on the bank debt is variable and approximates current market rates. As a result, Level 2 inputs are utilized to determine the fair value of our long term debt.

Operating cash flows for operating leases 

In general, our leases have remaining lease terms of approximately year to years. These leases generally contain renewal options for periods ranging from two to five years. Because the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal options, the options are not considered in determining the lease term and associated potential option payments are excluded from lease payments. Expenses associated with operating leases are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Variable lease costs, such as utilities and common area maintenance charges, are excluded from lease liabilities and expensed as incurred. The variable lease costs are determined based on terms in the lease contracts and primarily relate to usage of the ROU asset and services received from the lessor.

The tax benefit from amortization on these assets is included to show the full economic benefit of deductions for all acquired intangibles with a step-up in tax basis. Due to our acquisitive nature, tax deductions allowed on acquired intangible assets and goodwill provide us with a significant supplemental economic benefit.

 Assets Under Management 
 Our profitability is largely affected by the level and composition of our AUM (including asset class and distribution channel) and the effective fee rates on our products. The amount and composition of our AUM are, and will continue to be, influenced by a number of factors, including; (i) investment performance, including fluctuations in the financial markets and the quality of our investment decisions; (ii) client flows into and out of our various strategies and investment vehicles; (iii) industry trends toward products or strategies that we either do or do not offer; (iv) our ability to attract and retain high quality investment, distribution, marketing and management personnel; (v) our decision to close strategies or limit growth of assets in a strategy when we believe it is in the best interest of our clients or conversely to re open strategies in part or entirely; and (vi) general investor sentiment and confidence. Our goal is to establish and maintain a client base that is diversified by Franchise and Solutions, asset class, distribution channel and vehicle. Due to rounding, AUM numbers presented in the tables below may not add up precisely to the totals provided.

 Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information 
 We use non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the underlying operations of our business.

 On December 31, 2021, the Company entered into the Third Amendment (the Third Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the guarantors party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the Company obtained incremental term loans (the 2021 Incremental Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of 505.0 million and used the proceeds to fund the WestEnd Acquisition and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The 2021 Incremental Term Loans mature in December 2028 and bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either LIBOR (adjusted for reserves and subject to a 50 basis point floor) plus a margin of 2.25 or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 1.25 . 
 2022 LIBOR to Term SOFR Rate Transition 
 On September 23, 2022, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment (the Fourth Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement to change the interest rate on the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans from LIBOR to a rate based on SOFR plus a ten-basis point credit spread adjustment. There was no change to the applicable margin on the referenced rate as a result of the Fourth Amendment. 
 The LIBOR rate loans outstanding as of the Fourth Amendment s effective date continued as LIBOR rate loans until the end of their then current interest periods. The 2021 Incremental Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on September 30, 2022, while the Repriced Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on October 6, 2022. Also on October 6, 2022, the interest periods for the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans were aligned and the three-month Term SOFR rate was elected for all the Company s term loans. 
 2020 Swap Transaction 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company monetized the gain on the floating-to-fixed Swap transaction entered into in 2020 to effectively fix the interest rate on 450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026. 
 The deferred gain on the termination of the Swap is being amortized on a straight-line basis through July 1, 2026 and is included in interest expense and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unamortized deferred gain on Swap monetization was 29.1 million and 41.6 million, respectively, before tax. 
 The Swap was designated as a cash flow hedge. Prior to its termination, the Swap was measured at fair value with mark-to-market gains or losses deferred and included in AOCI(L), net of tax, to the extent the hedge was determined to be effective. Gains or losses were reclassified to interest expenses and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reclassified income of 5.1 million and 14.0 million, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as a result of changes in the fair value of the Swap. 
 Due to the termination of the Swap, there was no amount receivable from the Swap counterparty at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 14, Derivatives, for further information on the Swap. 
 Contingent Consideration 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had 139.6 million in contingent consideration that is estimated to be payable over the next year and three years resulting from the WestEnd Acquisition. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a decrease of 1.6 million and an increase of 2.4 million, respectively, in the contingent payment liability associated with the WestEnd Acquisition, which is included in consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In March 2024, the Company paid 80.0 million in cash to sellers for the first WestEnd earn out period payment. At September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of the WestEnd Acquisition contingent payments was 139.6 million, and a maximum of 240.0 million in contingent consideration 80.0 million per year) is potentially payable to sellers. 
 There were no other significant changes to our contractual obligations as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Capital Requirements 
 Victory Capital Services is a registered broker-dealer subject to the Uniform Net Capital requirements under the Exchange Act, which requires maintenance of certain minimum net capital levels. In addition, we have certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that have minimum capital requirements. As a result, such subsidiaries of our Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parents.

The 15.0 million increase in cash provided by operating activities is due to a 54.0 million increase in net income partially offset by a 31.8 million and 7.2 million decrease in non-cash and working capital items, respectively. 
 Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 233.2 million and comprised of 158.0 million and 87.7 million of net income and non-cash items, respectively, partially offset by 12.5 million in working capital source of cash. 
 Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.6 million and consisted of primarily of property and equipment purchases of 1.1 million and 0.5 million of net trading activity. 
 Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 6.3 million and consisted of primarily of property and equipment purchases of 4.4 million and 1.9 million of net trading activity. 
 Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 182.0 million and was mostly attributable to payment of consideration for acquisition, payment of dividends, repayment of long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, and net activity related to stock-based equity awards of 80.0 million, 73.0 million, 9.5 million, 6.7 million, and 11.8 million, respectively.

 Item 3. Quant itative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market Risk 
 Substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment management, fund administration and distribution fees, which are primarily based on the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, our revenues and net income may decline as a result of our AUM decreasing due to depreciation of our investment portfolios. In addition, such depreciation could cause our clients to withdraw their assets in favor of other investment alternatives that they perceive to offer higher returns or lower risk, which could cause our revenues and net income to decline further. 
 The value of our AUM was approximately 176 billion at September 30, 2024. A 10 increase or decrease in the value of our AUM, if proportionately distributed over all of our strategies, products and client relationships, would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately 91.5 million at our weighted-average fee rate of 52 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Because of declining fee rates from larger relationships and differences in our fee rates across investment strategies, a change in the composition of our AUM, in particular, an increase in the proportion of our total AUM attributable to strategies, clients or relationships with lower effective fee rates, could have a material negative impact on our overall weighted-average fee rate. The same 10 increase or decrease in the value of our total AUM, if attributed entirely to a proportionate increase or decrease in the AUM of the Victory Funds, to which we provide a range of services in addition to those provided to institutional separate accounts, would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately 103.8 million at the Victory Funds aggregate weighted-average fee rate of 59 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. If the same 10 increase or decrease in the value of our total AUM was attributable entirely to a proportionate increase or decrease in the assets of our institutional separate accounts, it would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately 70.4 million at the weighted-average fee rate across all of our institutional separate accounts of 40 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 As is customary in the investment management industry, clients invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to certain asset classes, which exposes their investment to the benefits and risks of those asset classes. We believe our clients invest in each of our strategies in order to gain exposure to the portfolio securities of the respective strategies and may implement their own risk management program or procedures. We have not adopted a corporate level risk management policy regarding client assets, nor have we attempted to hedge at the corporate level or within individual strategies the market risks that would affect the value of our overall AUM and related revenues. Some of these risks, such as sector and currency risks, are inherent in certain strategies, and clients may invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to particular risks. While negative returns in our strategies and net client cash outflows do not directly reduce the assets on our balance sheet (because the assets we manage are owned by our clients, not us), any reduction in the value of our AUM would result in a reduction in our revenues. 
 Exchange Rate Risk 
 A portion of the accounts that we advise hold investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent our AUM are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the value of that AUM will decrease with an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar or increase with a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar. Each investment team monitors its own exposure to exchange rate risk and makes decisions on how to manage that risk in the portfolios they manage. We believe many of our clients invest in those strategies in order to gain exposure to non U.S. currencies, or may implement their own hedging programs. As a result, we generally do not hedge an investment portfolio s exposure to non U.S. currency. 
 We have not adopted a corporate-level risk management policy to manage this exchange rate risk. Assuming 11 of our AUM are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and excluding the impact of any hedging arrangement, a 10 increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would decrease or increase the fair value of our AUM by approximately 1.9 billion, which would cause an annualized increase or decrease in revenues of approximately 10.1 million at our weighted-average fee rate for the business of 52 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. On March 27, 2020, the Company executed the Swap, a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction, to effectively fix the interest rate at 3.465 on 450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026. On February 18, 2021, pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company lowered the spread on the Term Loan by 0.25 resulting in a new fixed rate of 3.215 on the 450 million of Term Loan subject to the Swap. On September 26, 2022, the Company and the Swap counterparty executed an amendment to the Swap to update LIBOR 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 conventions to SOFR conventions and to modify the fixed rate for the change from three-month LIBOR to three-month Term SOFR effective on October 6, 2022. On October 30, 2023, the Company monetized the gain on the Swap and entered into an agreement to terminate the Swap, which was effective on October 30, 2023. Refer to Note 14, Derivatives, for further information on the Swap. At September 30, 2024, we were exposed to interest rate risk as a result of the amounts outstanding under the 2019 Credit Agreement, as amended. Refer to Note 9, Debt, for a description of the amounts outstanding as of such date and the applicable interest rate. 
 Item 4. Cont rols and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) at September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTH ER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Le gal Proceedings 
 On August 20, 2024, Victory filed with the SEC the Preliminary Proxy Statement, and on September 6, 2024, Victory filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement in relation to Amundi contributing to Victory all of the shares of Amundi US, resulting in Victory acquiring Amundi US and Amundi US becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Victory. As of September 30, 2024, two complaints have been filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County by purported Victory stockholders against Victory and the members of the Victory board of directors (the Board in connection with the Contribution: Kent v. Victory Capital Holdings, Inc., et al ., Index No. 654929/2024 (filed September 19, 2024) and Lawrence v. Victory Capital Holdings, Inc., et al ., Index No. 654920/2024 (filed September 19, 2024) (collectively, the Stockholder Litigation ). The complaints in the Stockholder Litigation include allegations that, among other things, the defendants caused to be filed a materially incomplete and misleading Proxy Statement with the SEC relating to the proposed Contribution and assert claims for alleged negligent misrepresentation and concealment and negligence under New York common law. Additionally, since the filing of the Preliminary Proxy Statement, Victory received five demand letters from purported Victory stockholders alleging similar insufficiencies in the disclosures in the Preliminary Proxy Statement and/or the Proxy Statement (such letters, the Demand Letters, and together with the Stockholder Litigation, the Litigation Matters ). 
 The plaintiffs in the Stockholder Litigation seek various remedies, which include, among other things: (i) enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed Contribution until the defendants disclose certain allegedly material information that was allegedly omitted from the Proxy Statement; (ii) in the event that the proposed Contribution is consummated, rescinding it or awarding actual and punitive damages to the plaintiffs; (iii) awarding the plaintiffs fees and expenses in connection with the Stockholder Litigation, including reasonable attorneys and experts fees and expenses; and (iv) granting such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. 
 Victory believes that the allegations contained in the Litigation Matters are without merit, that the disclosures in the Proxy Statement comply with applicable laws, and that no further disclosures are required to supplement the Proxy Statement under applicable laws. Victory specifically denies all allegations in the Litigation Matters. 
 We cannot predict the outcome of the above matters or estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss, if any. Although the proceedings are subject to uncertainties inherent in the litigation process and the ultimate disposition of these proceedings is not presently determinable, we intend to vigorously defend these cases. In addition to those items disclosed above, we are, from time to time, subject to claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC and the information contained in this report. The declaration, payment and determination of the amount of our quarterly dividends may change at any time. In making decisions regarding our quarterly dividends, we consider general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our businesses and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions (including under the terms of our 2019 Credit Agreement as amended) and legal, tax, regulatory and such other factors as we may deem relevant. There have been no material changes to the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equ ity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 (c) Issuer purchases of equity securities. 
 In December 2023, the Company s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (the 2024 Share Repurchase Program authorizing the repurchase of up to 100.0 million of the Company s Common Stock through December 31, 2025. Under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program, which took effect in December 2023, the Company may purchase its shares from time to time in privately negotiated transactions, through block trades, pursuant to open market purchases, or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the SEC. The amount and timing of purchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program will depend on a number of factors including the price and availability of the Company s shares, trading volume, capital availability, Company performance and general economic and market conditions. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program can be suspended or discontinued at any time.

 94 

shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least three Business Days remain in the Intervening Event Notice Period subsequent to the time Buyer notifies Seller of any such material development (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions)), and (iii) Buyer s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consulting with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change, after taking into account any adjustments proposed by Seller during the Intervening Event Notice Period, would cause the Buyer Board of Directors to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The parties acknowledge and agree that any Adverse Recommendation Change may be made solely and exclusively pursuant to this Section 6.5(f) and no other provisions of this Agreement. 
 (g)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if, prior to the mailing of the Buyer Proxy Statement, the event set forth on Schedule 6.5(g) has occurred, then Buyer shall not be required to submit the Governance Charter Amendment to Buyer s stockholders at the Buyer Stockholders Meeting to consider and vote thereon.

The Indemnitor, by notice to the Indemnitee within ten (10) days of the receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, shall have the right, at its option and expense, to assume the defense of any such matter with its own counsel, provided that the Indemnitor shall allow the Indemnitee a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense.

 (2)	each party shall reasonably cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim, and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith; and 
 (3)	the Indemnitor shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, settle or compromise any pending or threatened Action in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such Action) or consent to the entry of any judgment which (i) does not, to the extent that the Indemnitee may have any liability with respect to such Action, include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a written release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Action, (ii) imposes injunctive or other equitable relief on the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, or (iii) involves a finding or admission of any violation of applicable Law by the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates. 
 (C)	If the Indemnitor elects not to assume the defense of and indemnification for such matter, then the Indemnitee shall defend such matter with the assistance of counsel selected by the Indemnitee; provided that the Indemnitee shall not settle, adjust or compromise such matter, or admit any liability with respect to such matter, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 121 

Agreement, including this Section 10.3(e) shall limit the rights or remedies of, or constitute a waiver of any rights or remedies by, any Person for Fraud or pursuant to (or shall otherwise operate to interfere with the operation of) Section 2.4, Section 2.5, Section 2.7 or Section 12.14, or the provisions of the Distribution and Services Agreements, the Shareholder Agreement, and the Transition Services Agreements.
