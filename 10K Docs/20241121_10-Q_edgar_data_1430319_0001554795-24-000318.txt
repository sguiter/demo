FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand future prospects and make informed
investment decisions. This report contains these types of statements. Words such as may, intend, expect, 
 believe, anticipate, estimate, project, or continue or comparable
terminology used in connection with any discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking statements.
You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. All forward-looking
statements reflect our present expectation of future events and are subject to a number of important factors and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 

In this report references to C C Tours, 
 the Company, we, us, and our refer to C C Tours, Inc. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive Overview 

We have not recorded revenues from operations as of
the date of this report and we have not established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to obtain capital from
management, significant stockholders or third parties to cover operating expenses; however, there is no assurance that additional funding
will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable company
and acquire or enter into a merger with such company. 

The type of business opportunity with which we acquire
or merge will affect our profitability for the long term. We may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing
company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is
an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative,
a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but
which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense,
and loss of voting control which may occur through a public offering. 

Our management has not had any contact or discussions
with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially
unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or
earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early
stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may complete a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized
by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there
can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. 

We anticipate that the Company will likely be able
to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective
stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business
in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us
because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another. 

We anticipate that the selection of a business combination
will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries
and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a
publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating
or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in
a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility
in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may
occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation
and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. 

9 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have not recorded revenues from operations since
inception and we have relied primarily upon other parties to provide loans and pay for operating expenses. At September 30, 2024 we had
cash of 2,834 compared to 17,225 at December 31, 2023. Our total liabilities increased to 387,196 at September 30, 2024 compared to
 368,167 at December 31, 2023. The increase in liabilities primarily represents advances and services provided by third parties and accrued
interest. 

We intend to obtain capital from management, significant
stockholders and third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available.
Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity
and acquire or enter into a merger with such company. The type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our
profitability for the long term. 

During the next 12 months, we anticipate incurring
additional costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through advances and loans
provided by management, significant stockholders or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance of our Common Stock in lieu of cash
to convert debt or pay for expenses. 

Results of Operations 

We did not record revenues in either the nine months ended September 30,
2024, or in 2023. General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 18,891 compared to 11,500 the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,890 compared
to 2,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Total other expense increased to 14,529 for the
September 30, 2024 Nine-Month Period compared to 12,894 for the September 30, 2023 Nine-Month Period. Total other expense increased to
 4,843 for the September 30, 2024 Third Quarter compared to 4,342 for the September 30, 2023 Third Quarter. Total other expense represents
interest expense related to notes payable. 

Our net loss increased to 33,420 for the September
30, 2024 Nine-Month Period compared to 24,394 for the September 30, 2023 Nine-Month Period. Our net loss increased to 9,733 for the
September 30, 2024 Third Quarter compared to 7,242 for the September 30, 2023 Third Quarter. Management expects net losses to continue
until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity. 

Commitments and Obligations 

At September 30, 2024 we reported notes payable totaling
 242,290 representing services received, as well as cash advances received from third parties. All of the notes payable are uncollateralized,
carry interest at 8 and are due on demand. Accrued interest related to these notes payable totaled 134,406 at September 30, 2024. No
payments on principal or interest have been made to date. 

A third-party consultant has provided professional
services, paid for legal, accounting and administrative services on our behalf and/or provided advances to cover our operating costs.
These accumulated services total 10,500 as of September 30, 2024, are not formally documented, have no repayment terms and thus we have
recognized them as accounts payable. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term
is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). A company qualifies as an emerging growth company
if it has total annual gross revenues of less than 1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year and, as of December 8,
2011, had not sold Common equity securities under a registration statement. Under the JOBS Act we are permitted to, and intend to, rely
on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides
that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits
of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such
new or revised accounting standards.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms
of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President,
who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure
the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to remediate this deficiency
until we acquire or merge with another company. 

Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted
an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and determined that there were no changes made in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

11 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION

no proceedings in which any of our Directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party
or has a material interest adverse to our company.
