 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLID ATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 
 million at September 30, 2024. The Company has a history of operating losses and has not had significant recurring cash inflows from revenue. The Company s operations have been financed primarily from sales of its equity securities, issuance of debt and a combination of license fees, milestone payments, royalty income, and other fees received from its collaboration partners. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur losses as it continues the research and development of its product candidates, and the Company does not expect revenues to generate sufficient funding to sustain its operations in the near-term. The Company expects to continue fulfilling its funding needs through cash inflows from revenues, licensing and research collaboration transactions, additional equity capital raises and other arrangements. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of million at September 30, 2024 will enable the Company to fund its current and planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. Actual cash requirements could differ from management s projections due to many factors, including the timing and results of the Company s clinical trials for DURAVYU , additional investments in research and development programs, competing technological and market developments and the costs of any strategic acquisitions and/or development of compleme ntary business opportunities.

Chargebacks, discounts and fees and rebates are recorded as a component of accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheets (See Note 6). License and Collaboration Agreements and Royalty Income Eyebiotech Limited On May 17, 2024, the Company entered into a license agreement (the Eyebio License Agreement) with Eyebiotech Limited (Eyebio). Under this agreement, the Company granted Eyebio a non-exclusive, sublicensable, assignable license to certain patent rights to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and export licensed products for therapeutic ophthalmological uses worldwide. In consideration for the rights granted, Eyebio made a one-time upfront payment of million to the Company upon execution of the Eyebio License Agreement. Additionally, Eyebio agreed to pay certain milestone payments and tiered royalties based on the achievement of development and regulatory milestones and the annual net sales of licensed products, respectively. The Company classified the cash proceeds of the million upfront payment received from Eyebio as license and collaboration revenue upon the execution of the Eyebio License Agreement, as this was the only performance obligation identified. This amount is not an advance payment for the provision of future goods or services and is included in the current transaction price. The non-exclusive, sublicensable, assignable license is a functional, right-to-use license, and, therefore, any consideration associated with it is recognized at a point in time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recorded million in license and collaboration revenue related to the upfront payment. On July 12, 2024, Merck Co., Inc. announced the completion of the acquisition of Eyebio. Eyebio is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merck Co., Inc. The acquisition does not materially impact the terms of the Eyebio License Agreement. ANI Product Rights Agreement and Commercial Supply Agreement On (the Closing Date), the Company entered into a PRA with ANI (formerly Alimera). Under the PRA, the Company granted to ANI an exclusive and sublicensable right and license (the License) under the Company s and its affiliates interest in certain of the Company s and its affiliates intellectual property to develop, manufacture, sell, commercialize, and otherwise exploit certain products, including YUTIQ , for the treatment and prevention of uveitis in the entire world except Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Additionally, pursuant to the PRA, the Company transferred and assigned to ANI certain assets (the Transferred Assets) and certain contracts with third parties related to YUTIQ , including the new drug application for YUTIQ (collectively, the Asset

million upfront payment. ANI will also make four quarterly payments of million to the Company totaling million during 2024. ANI will also pay royalties to the Company from to at a percentage of low-to-mid double digits of ANI s related U.S. annual net sales of certain products (including YUTIQ in excess of certain thresholds, beginning at million in 2025, and increasing annually thereafter. Upon ANI s payment of the Upfront Payment and the 2024 quarterly payments, the licenses and rights granted to ANI will automatically become perpetual and irrevocable. Payments received from ANI are non-refundable. On the Closing Date, the Company and ANI also entered into a commercial supply agreement (CSA), pursuant to which, during the term of the PRA, the Company agreed to manufacture and exclusively supply to ANI agreed-upon quantities of YUTIQ necessary for ANI to commercialize YUTIQ in the United States at certain cost plus amounts, subject to adjustments and potential extensions and terminations set forth in the CSA (the Supply Transaction and together with the License and the Asset Transfer, the Transaction). The Company classified the cash proceeds of the million Upfront Payment received from ANI as deferred revenue at the Closing Date, pursuant to the PRA and the CSA because the License and supply units to be delivered under both agreements comprise a single, combined performance obligation as ANI will not have the right or ability to manufacture YUTIQ (or have YUTIQ manufactured by a third-party contract manufacturing organization) over the initial term pursuant to the CSA. The combined performance obligation is satisfied over time using the units delivered output method to measure progress based on initial estimated supply units of YUTIQ over the term for purposes of recognizing revenue, such that revenue is recognized based on the value transferred in the form of units of product in the satisfaction of a performance obligation. Through this method, the Company compares the actual units delivered to date with the current estimated total to be delivered in the contractual term to measure the satisfaction of the performance obligation and recognize revenue. The Company will monitor its estimate of total units to be delivered to determine if an adjustment is needed to ensure that revenue is recognized proportionally for units delivered to date relative to the total units expected to be delivered for the combined performance obligation. Such estimates of the total delivery will be reassessed on an ongoing basis. If the Company determines that a change in estimate is necessary, it will adjust revenue using a cumulative catch-up method. Revenue from sales of product supply to ANI under the CSA was million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. License and Collaboration revenue related to the PRA was million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. License and collaboration revenue, related to additional transitional services was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had million and as current and non-current deferred revenue recognized under the PRA. SWK Royalty Purchase Agreement Pursuant to a royalty purchase agreement (RPA) with SWK Funding LLC (SWK), the Company sold its right to receive royalty payments on future sales of products subject to a licensing and development agreement, as amended, with ANI (the Amended ANI Agreement) for an upfront cash payment of million. The Company classified the proceeds received from SWK as deferred revenue at inception of the RPA and is recognizing revenue as royalty payments are made from ANI to SWK. The Company recognized million and million of royalty revenue related to the RPA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and million and million of royalty revenue related to the RPA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had million and million as current and non-current deferred revenue recognized under the RPA, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 , the Company classified million and million as current and non-current deferred revenue recognized under the RPA, respectively. Ocumension Therapeutics Pursuant to license agreements and Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Company, Ocumension has: An exclusive license for the development and commercialization of its three-year micro insert using the Durasert technology for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis of the eye (YUTIQ in the U.S.) in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan at its own cost and expense in return for royalties based on sales with the Company supplying products for clinical trials and commercial sale; 

 An exclusive license for the development and commercialization in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan of DEXYCU for the treatment of post-operative inflammation following ocular surgery at its own cost and expense in return for royalties based on sales with the Company supplying product for clinical trials and commercial sale; and

Royalty income of and million was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . royalty income was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. License and collaboration revenue related to additional technical assistance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial. Exclusive License Agreement with Betta Pharmaceuticals, Co., Ltd. On May 2, 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement (the Betta License Agreement) with Betta Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (Betta), an affiliate of Equinox Sciences, LLC (Equinox) (see Note 10). Under the Betta License Agreement, the Company granted to Betta an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license under certain of the Company s intellectual property to develop, use (but not make or have made), sell, offer for sale, and import the Company s product candidate, DURAVYU , an investigational sustained delivery treatment for anti-VEGF-mediated retinal diseases combining vorolanib, a selective and patent-protected tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with Durasert E (the Licensed Product), in the field of ophthalmology (the Betta Field) in the greater area of China, including China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Macau Special Administrative Region, and Taiwan (the Betta Territory). The Company retained rights under the Company s intellectual property to, among other things, conduct clinical trials on the Licensed Product in the Betta Field in the Betta Territory. In consideration for the rights granted by the Company, Betta agreed to pay the Company tiered, mid-to-high single-digit royalties based upon annual net sales of Licensed Products in the Betta Territory. The royalties are payable on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and region-by-region basis commencing on the first commercial sale of a Licensed Product in a region and continuing until the later of (i) the date that is twelve (12) years after first commercial sale of such Licensed Product in such region, and (ii) the first day of the month following the month in which a generic product corresponding to such Licensed Product is launched in the relevant region. The royalty rate is subject to reduction under certain circumstances, including when there is no valid claim of a licensed patent that covers a Licensed Product in a particular region. Betta is responsible for all costs relating to development, registration, manufacturing, marketing, advertising, promotional, launch, and sales activities in connection with the Licensed Products in the Betta Field in the Betta Territory. Betta is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, seek regulatory approval for, and commercialize at least one Licensed Product in the Betta Field in the Betta Territory. The Betta License Agreement also requires Betta to achieve certain diligence milestones relating to regulatory filings, patient dosing, and regulatory approval by certain specified deadlines set forth in the Betta License Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and extensions as set forth in the Betta License Agreement. Betta s development activities will be conducted pursuant to a development plan subject to periodic updates. In the event that the Company conducts a global registrational clinical trial for a Licensed Product in the Betta Field, Betta will have the right to participate in such clinical trial by including clinical trial sites in the Betta Territory in accordance with the terms of the Betta License Agreement. The Company has also agreed to provide certain technology transfer and other support services to Betta subject to certain conditions and limitations set forth in the Betta License Agreement. Revenue from license and collaboration revenue or royalty income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to this agreement was immaterial.

The Company recognized an initial increase of million to its lease liabilities and million to its right-of-use (ROU) assets resulting from the Northbridge Lease during the second quarter of 2024. Since the Company elected to account for each lease component and its associated non-lease components as a single combined component, all contract consideration was allocated to the respective lease components. The expected lease terms include non-cancellable lease periods. Renewal option periods have not been included in the determination of the lease terms as they are not deemed reasonably certain of exercise.

 Our Business 
 Overview 
 We are a company committed to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics to help improve the lives of patients with serious retinal diseases. Our pipeline leverages our proprietary bioerodible Durasert E technology for sustained intraocular drug delivery. The Company s lead product candidate, DURAVYU , is an investigational sustained delivery treatment for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) -mediated retinal diseases combining vorolanib, a selective and patent-protected tyrosine kinase inhibitor with bioerodible Durasert E . DURAVYU is presently in Phase 3 clinical trials as a sustained delivery treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), the leading cause of vision loss among people 50 years of age and older in the United States, and in Phase 2 clinical trial for diabetic macular edema (DME). 
 Recent Developments 
 Completed an underwritten public offering with gross proceeds of 161.0 million in October. The Company sold 14,636,363 shares of its common stock, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 1,909,090 shares of common stock. The shares of common stock were sold at a public offering price of 11.00 per share. 

Announced the grand opening of EyePoint s Northbridge, MA manufacturing facility in October. The 40,000 square foot Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP) compliant commercial manufacturing facility was built to meet U.S. FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) and will support global manufacturing across the Company s portfolio, including lead pipeline asset, DURAVYU upon potential regulatory approval. 

Announced the appointment of esteemed industry leader Fred Hassan to the Company s Board of Directors in September. 

R D Highlights 
 Announced positive interim 16-week data for the ongoing open label Phase 2 VERONA clinical trial of DURAVYU for diabetic macular edema (DME) in October. DURAVYU 2.7mg demonstrated an early, sustained, and clinically meaningful improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) with a gain of +8.9 letters compared to baseline versus +3.2 letters for aflibercept control. DURAVYU 2.7mg also demonstrated concomitant structural improvement with CST (central subfield thickness) improvement of 68.1 microns versus 30.5 microns for aflibercept control. Notably, both DURAVYU doses 

23 

showed an immediate benefit over aflibercept control in both BCVA and CST demonstrating the differentiated drug release profile of DURAVYU with immediate bioavailability. Additionally, a favorable safety and tolerability profile continued for both DURAVYU arms. The Company expects to report the full topline results in the first quarter of 2025, once all patients complete the trial. 

Announced first patient dosed in the Phase 3 LUGANO clinical trial of DURAVYU in wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). The second Phase 3 LUCIA pivotal trial initiation is expected to have first patient dosing by end of 2024. The LUGANO and LUCIA clinical trials are designed for potential global regulatory and commercial success with every six-month re-dosing in both trials. With over 160 trial sites committed and robust DAVIO 2 data the company anticipates rapid enrollment of both trials with topline data anticipated in 2026.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that we make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base our estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, anticipated results, and trends, and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances at the time. By their nature, these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we set forth our critical accounting policies and estimates, which included revenue recognition, reserves for variable consideration associated with our commercial revenue and recognition of expense in outsourced clinical trial agreements. See Note 2 of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of our accounting policies and estimates.

Product Sales, Net 
 Product sales, net represents the gross sales of YUTIQ and DEXYCU less provisions for product sales allowances. Product sales, net decreased by 0.2 million, or 19 , to 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. This decrease was driven by lower sales of YUTIQ product supply to ANI. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, product sales, net included 0.7 million of product supply under the existing commercial supply agreement (CSA) with ANI. 
 
 License and Collaboration Agreement 
 License and collaboration agreement revenue decreased by 4.6 million, or 32 , to 9.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. This decrease was due to lower recognition of deferred revenue related to the agreement to license YUTIQ product rights to ANI due to lower product sales to ANI. 
 Royalty Income 
 Royalty income increased by less than 0.1 million, or 20 , to 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. The increase was attributable to higher non-cash Alimera royalties payable to SWK Funding LLC. 
 Cost of Sales, Excluding Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets 
 Cost of sales decreased by 0.5 million, or 39 , to 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to lower commercial product sales year over year. 
 25 

Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses increased by 12.2 million, or 70 , to 29.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. This increase was attributable primarily to (i) 4.0 million in increased clinical trial costs related to the initiation of DURAVYU in Phase 3 clinical trials (LUGANO and LUCIA) for wet AMD, (ii) 3.8 million higher personnel expense to support clinical trial activity and product development, including 2.1 million of non-cash stock compensation, (iii) 1.4 million higher clinical trial material expense to be used in phase 3 clinical trials for wet AMD, (iv) 1.3 million in higher professional services, (v) 1.0 million higher facility and IT expenses, and (vi) 0.7 million in other R D expenses. We anticipate an increase in future periods of clinical trials expenses due to our continuing Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 0.5 million, or 95 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. This decrease was driven by discontinued YUTIQ promotion due to the agreement that granted YUTIQ license and rights to ANI in the second quarter of 2023 and the Company's exit from the commercial business. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 2.4 million, or 23 , to 13.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to 1.8 million in stock-based compensation and 0.8 million in personnel costs, partially offset by lower legal and other administrative expenses. 
 Interest (Expense) Income 
 Interest income from investments in marketable securities and institutional money market funds increased by 1.6 million, or 90 , to 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. This increase was due primarily to an increase in cash and marketable securities on hand.

 License and collaboration agreement revenue increased by 10.1 million, or 57 , to 27.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. This increase was due to higher recognition of deferred revenue related to the agreement to license YUTIQ product rights to ANI from 9 months of revenue in 2024 compared to a partial year in 2023. 
 Royalty Income 
 Royalty income increased by 0.7 million, or 88 , to 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to increased Ocumension Therapeutics royalties from YUTIQ product sales in China. 
 Cost of Sales, Excluding Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets 
 Cost of sales decreased by 0.7 million, or 20 , to 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to lower commercial product sales year over year. 
 27 

Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses increased by 42.8 million, or 92 , to 89.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. This increase was attributable primarily to (i) 10.0 million higher personnel expense to support clinical trial activity and product development, including 5.7 million of non-cash stock compensation, (ii) 8.8 million in increased clinical trial costs related to DURAVYU in Phase 2 (DAVIO2) and Phase 3 (LUGANO and LUCIA) clinical trials for wet AMD, NPDR (PAVIA), and DME (VERONA), (iii) 5.7 million associated with non-cash equity award modifications expense, (iv) 5.0 million for a milestone payment due for completion of our Phase 2 wet AMD (DAVIO2) clinical trial, (v) 4.4 million in higher clinical trial material expense, (vi) 3.2 million higher DURAVYU non-clinical expenses, (vii) 1.5 million in higher facility costs, (viii) 1.6 million in severance related expense, and (ix) 2.5 million of other R D expenses. We anticipate an increase in future periods of clinical trials expenses due to our continuing Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 11.4 million, or 99 , to 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. This decrease was driven by discontinued YUTIQ promotion due to the agreement that granted YUTIQ license and rights to ANI in the second quarter of 2023 and the Company's exit from the commercial business. Expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included support for ongoing government reporting requirements. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 10.9 million, or 38 , to 39.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. This increase was driven by (i) 9.2 million in stock-based compensation, (ii) 3.0 million in higher personnel costs, partially offset by 1.4 million in lower legal and other administrative expenses. 
 Interest (Expense) Income 
 Interest income from investments in marketable securities and institutional money market funds increased by 6.5 million, or 142 , to 11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year. This increase was due primarily to an increase in cash and marketable securities and higher interest rates in the current year to date period. 
 There was no interest expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the repayment of the loan under the loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB Loan Agreement) on May 17, 2023. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1.2 million. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have had a history of operating losses and an absence of significant recurring cash inflows from revenue, and at September 30, 2024 we had a total accumulated deficit of 831.6 million. Our operations have been financed primarily from sales of our equity securities, issuance of debt and a combination of license fees, milestone payments, royalty income and other fees received from collaboration partners. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 1,299,506 shares of our common stock under the ATM facility at a weighted average price of 9.36 per share for gross proceeds of approximately 12.2 million. Share issue costs, including sales agent commissions, totaled approximately 0.4 million. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 At September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities of 253.8 million. We expect the cash, cash equivalents and investments on September 30, 2024, along with the net proceeds from the October 161.0 million equity financing will enable us to fund operations into 2027. Due to the difficulty and uncertainty associated with the design and implementation of preclinical studies and clinical trials, we will continue to assess our cash and cash equivalents and future funding requirements. However, there is no assurance that additional funding will be achieved and that we will succeed in our future operations. We expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue to develop our product candidates and seek marketing approval and, subject to obtaining such approval, the eventual commercialization of our product candidates. If we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we will incur significant sales, 
 28 

marketing, and manufacturing expenses. We also expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls, and similar requirements associated with operating as a public reporting company. 
 Actual cash requirements could differ from management s projections due to many factors including additional investments in research and development programs, clinical trial expenses for DURAVYU and EYP-2301, competing technological and market developments and the costs of any strategic acquisitions and/or development of complementary business opportunities. 
 The amount of additional capital we will require will be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 1. the scope, progress, results, and costs of clinical trials of DURAVYU , as a sustained delivery intravitreal treatment for wet AMD and DME; 

2. our expectations regarding the timing and clinical development of our product candidates, including DURAVYU and EYP-2301; 

3. the duration, scope, and outcome of the DOJ Subpoena and its impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows; 

4. whether and to what extent we internally fund, whether and when we initiate, and how we conduct additional pipeline product development programs; 

5. payments we receive under any new collaboration agreements or payments expected from existing agreements; 

6. whether and when we are able to enter into strategic arrangements for our products or product candidates and the nature of those arrangements; 

7. the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing any patent claims; 

8. the costs and timing to implement corrective and preventive actions required by the Warning Letter to the satisfaction of the FDA; 

9. changes in our operating plan, resulting in increases or decreases in our need for capital; and 

10. our views on the availability, timing, and desirability of raising capital. 

We expect to seek additional funding to sustain our future operations and while we have successfully raised capital in the past, the ability to raise capital in future periods is not assured. We do not know if additional capital will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. Collaboration, licensing or other agreements may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we seek to sell our equity securities, we do not know whether and to what extent we will be able to do so, or on what terms. If available, additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, debt financing may involve restrictive covenants or other unfavorable terms and dilute our existing stockholders equity, and funding through collaboration, licensing or other commercial agreements may be on unfavorable terms, including requiring us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products. If adequate financing is not available if and when needed, we may delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate research or development programs, if any, postpone or cancel the pursuit of product candidates, or otherwise significantly curtail our operations to reduce our cash requirements and extend our capital. 
 Our consolidated statements of historical cash flows are summarized as follows (in thousands):

Operating cash outflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 90.4 million primarily due to our net loss of 89.5 million reduced by 25.8 million of non-cash expenses, which included 28.8 million of stock-based compensation, partially offset by 4.1 million for amortization of discount on available for sale of marketable securities. In addition, there was a change in working capital of 26.7 million, including 22.1 million of deferred revenue related to the agreement to license YUTIQ product rights to ANI. 
 29 

Operating cash inflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 25.0 million, primarily due to our net loss of 56.7 million reduced by 10.5 million of non-cash expenses, which included 8.5 million of stock-based compensation, 1.3 million of loss on extinguishment of debt, 0.7 million for the provision of excess and obsolete inventory, and less than 0.1 million of other non-cash charges. This was further offset by changes in working capital of 71.2 million, including 57.4 million of deferred revenue related to the agreement to license YUTIQ product rights to ANI, and 13.7 million of other working capital changes. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 119.7 million of net cash was used for the purchase of marketable securities, and 3.7 million was used for the purchase of property and equipment.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, particularly during the period in which this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was being prepared. 
 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving its desired objectives, and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 30 

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Pro ceedings 
 We are subject to various routine legal proceedings and claims incidental to our business, which management believes will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 We previously disclosed that in August 2022, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the District of Massachusetts seeking production of documents related to sales, marketing, and promotional practices, including as pertain to DEXYCU . We are cooperating fully with the government in connection with this matter. At this time, we are unable to predict the duration, scope or outcome of this matter or whether it could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. 
 Item 1A. Risk Fa ctors 
 This section augments and updates certain risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Annual Report). The following risk factors should be read together with the other risk factors disclosed in the Annual Report. In addition to the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, all of the risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our common stock. Any of these risks, many of which are beyond our control, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. We may also face other risks and uncertainties that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be material, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. For more information, see Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 We use our own facility for the manufacturing of YUTIQ and rely on third party suppliers for key components, and any disruptions to our or our suppliers operations could adversely affect YUTIQ s commercial viability and our ability to supply YUTIQ to ANI and Ocumension. 
 
 Pursuant to our agreements with our commercialization partners, we currently manufacture commercial supplies of YUTIQ ourselves at our Watertown, MA facility and rely on third party suppliers for key components of YUTIQ . We have, and will continue, to perform extensive audits of our suppliers, vendors, and contract laboratories. The cGMP requirements govern, among other things, recordkeeping, production processes, and controls, personnel, and quality control. To ensure that we continue to meet these requirements, we have and will continue to expend significant time, money, and effort. 
 
 The commercial manufacture of medical products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of medical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production and ensuring the absence of contamination. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state, and foreign regulations. We cannot assure you that any issue relating to the manufacture of YUTIQ will not occur in the future. 
 
 The FDA also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit our manufacturing facilities. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulation occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, the FDA may issue a Form FDA-483 and/or a warning letter, which may require remedial measures that may be costly and time consuming for us to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of commercial sales, recalls, market withdrawals, seizures or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. In February 2024, we received an FDA Form-483 at the conclusion of an FDA inspection of our Watertown facility which included certain observations specifically related to the manufacturing of YUTIQ , and a subsequent determination that our facility had been classified as Official Action Indicated (OAI), which could lead to an enforcement action or, if left un-addressed, negatively affect our manufacturing of YUTIQ . We submitted written responses to the FDA in March 2024 and May 2024 addressing the FDA s observations. 
 
 On July 12, 2024, we received a warning letter from the FDA Warning Letter ), citing alleged violations of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements in connection with the February 2024 FDA inspection at the Watertown facility and the associated February 2024 Form FDA-483, specifically related to the manufacturing of YUTIQ . The Warning Letter does not represent a final FDA determination of compliance. The Warning Letter requires that we implement certain corrective and preventive actions, including improvements to the process by which we investigate unexplained discrepancies, the implementation of additional 
 31 

written procedures for production and process control, and the adoption of additional control procedures to monitor the output and to validate the performance of manufacturing processes. Addressing FDA observations and advancing quality initiatives are key priorities for the Company, and the Company has implemented and plans to further implement improvements to strengthen quality and sustainable compliance. We responded to the FDA on August 1, 2024 and, based on current information, we believe the supply of YUTIQ to patients should not be materially interrupted. However, if we are unable to remediate the findings to the FDA s satisfaction, we may face additional consequences including an inability to satisfy our obligations under our supply agreements with ANI and Ocumension and possible FDA regulatory or legal actions. Notwithstanding, based on current information, we believe our other products in development, including DURAVYU , are not impacted by this regulatory action. 
 
 If our Contract Research Organizations (CROs), Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs), Contract Development Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs), vendors, and investigators do not successfully carry out their responsibilities or if we lose our relationships with them, our development efforts with respect to our product candidates could be delayed. 
 
 We are dependent on CROs, CMOs, CDMOs, vendors, and investigators for pre-clinical testing and clinical trials related to our product development programs, including for DURAVYU and other product candidates. These parties are not our employees, and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. If they do not timely fulfill their responsibilities or if their performance is inadequate, the development, and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. 
 
 The parties with which we contract for execution of clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of the trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. Their failure to meet their obligations could adversely affect clinical development of our product candidates. In addition, if we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable current Good Clinical Practices (GCP), the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications. Upon inspection, the FDA may determine that our clinical trials did not comply with GCP. 
 
 Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. Identifying, qualifying, and managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time-consuming, and cause delays in our development programs. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work and the new CRO may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and prospects. If any of our relationships with our CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. 
 
 Additionally, our CMOs may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If our CMOs were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide our product candidate to patients in clinical trials, or to provide product for the treatment of patients once approved, would be jeopardized. 
 
 In addition, any facilities located outside the United States (U.S.) that are used by us or by our CMOs or CDMOs to manufacture, test, and optimize our product candidates will be subject to various regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction in which they are located and in addition be subject to trade laws and regulations of the U.S. that may restrict our ability to continue to utilize certain CMOs or CDMOs. Foreign CMOs or CDMOs may be subject to U.S. legislation or investigations, including the proposed BIOSECURE Act, sanctions, trade restrictions, and other foreign regulatory requirements, which could increase the cost or reduce the supply of material available to us, delay the procurement or supply of such material, delay or impact clinical trials, have an adverse effect on our clinical drug development efforts and could adversely affect our financial condition and business prospects. For example, we currently engage with WuXi Apptec (WuXi), to perform certain process development, manufacturing, and testing associated with one of our product candidates, EYP-2301. WuXi has been identified as a U.S. national security threat in the proposed BIOSECURE Act, which, if enacted, or if alternatively implemented through executive or administrative action, could restrict WuXi s business in the U.S. or the ability of businesses in the U.S. to conduct business with WuXi. 
 
 Moreover, if a foreign regulatory authority curtails operations at such foreign facilities of our CMOs or CDMOs, or if trade laws are adopted limiting our ability to use such CMO or CDMO facilities, we may need to find alternative facilities, which could negatively impact our clinical development timelines. 
 
 Because we have relied on third parties, our internal capacity to perform certain functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risks that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, 
 32 

which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our ability to advance our product candidates through clinical trials will be compromised. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, CMOs, and CDMOs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and prospects. 
 
 Interim, top-line, initial and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to confirmation, audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. 
 
 From time to time, we may publicly disclose interim, top-line, initial or preliminary data from our clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data. For example, in October 2024, we announced preliminary results from our Phase 2 VERONA trial for DME. DURAVYU is still being studied in the Phase 2 VERONA trial for diabetic macular edema and topline data is expected in the first quarter of 2025. When reporting interim, top-line, initial or preliminary data from an ongoing trial, we may make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the interim, top-line, initial or preliminary results that we report, including the preliminary results from our Phase 2 VERONA trial for DME, may differ from future results of the same trials, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Interim, top-line, initial and preliminary data from clinical trials are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Interim, top-line, initial and preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the interim, top-line, initial or preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim, top-line, initial and preliminary data, including the preliminary results from our Phase 2 VERONA trial for DME, should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Adverse differences between interim, top-line, initial or preliminary data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects and may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline. 
 
 Further, regulatory agencies and others, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could adversely impact the potential of the particular program, the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval of the particular product candidate, commercialization of any approved product and the business prospects of the company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is derived from information that is typically extensive, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure. 
 
 If the interim, top-line, initial or preliminary data that we report differs from actual results, or if regulatory authorities or others, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates may be significantly impaired, which could materially harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.
