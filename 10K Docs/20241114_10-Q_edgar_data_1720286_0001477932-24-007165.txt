There was no financial impact to ISI from the dissolution. Our Outlook We are an early-stage company since we have not commenced planned principal operations. Our activities since inception include devoting substantially all of our efforts to business planning and development. Additionally, we have allocated a substantial portion of our time and investment to the completion of our development activities to launch our marketing plan and generate revenues and to raising capital. We have generated minimal revenue from operations. The Company s activities during this early stage are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. There is currently no public market for our common stock. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to initiate sales volume and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The financial statements do not include adjustments to reflect the possible effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 13 Table of Contents Results of Operations Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the Nine months ended September 30, 2023 Revenue and Cost of Sales During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 the company earned revenues of 686,164 and 0, respectively. The cost associated with the revenues earned in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 580,486. Operating Expenses and Loss from Operations Total operating expenses and profit from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 76,587, and 29,092, a decrease of 10,733 and increase of 116,411 from total operating expenses and loss from operations for the comparable nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Operating Expenses is due primarily to the Company cutting Professional fee expenses. The Professional fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 11,000 and 36,124, respectively which is a decrease of 25,124. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in General and Administrative expenses which were 18,499 and 2,695 for the nine months September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 respectively, which is an increase of 15,803. The increase in General and Administrative expenses is due an increase in the Company s organization costs as it seeks to be listed on a stock exchange. Other Income (Expense) For the nine months ended September 30,2024, the company received 171 in Other income from interest earned. There was no corresponding interest earned for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had Other Expenses of 357,200 resulting from a non-cash conversion loss related to the conversion of Common Stock B to Common Stock A. There were no Other Expenses for the same period in 2023. In September 2024, the Company s Board of Directors made a resolution to convert all of its issued and outstanding Common Stock B shares of 18,800,000 to Common Stock A shares. The intention was to convert the shares on a one-for-one basis with a cost basis for Common Stock B Shares at 2 cents per share. The conversion of Common B to Common A resulted in a non-cash conversion loss of 357,200 which is the APIC associated with the Common B cost basis of 2 cents per share. Net Loss and Net Comprehensive Loss We reported a net loss and net comprehensive loss of 327,937 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a net loss and net comprehensive loss of 24,020 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference in the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the loss for the nine months ended September 30,2023 is primarily the result of a non-cash conversion loss related to the Conversion of Common Stock B Shares to Common Stock A Shares in the amount of 357,200. The loss is the result of APIC from Common stock B shares which had a cost basis of 2 cents per share. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a cash balance of 72,963 and a credit cash balance of 10 respectively. Our working capital deficit was 49,990 and 70,204 respectively. The Company is considered to be an early-stage company and had generated revenues for the first time during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The current sales levels are not sufficient to fund our operating expenses as the company grows. We will need to raise significant additional capital to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, and grow our company. We do not anticipate we will be profitable in 2024. Therefore, our operations will be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing. Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. If we are successful in securing additional working capital, we intend to increase our marketing efforts to grow our revenues. Operating Activities Net cash flows provided by operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 58,098 versus 201,265 used in operations for the same period in 2023. The difference is due to a net gross profit from a sale in Q2 2024 of 105,679. There were no sales in 2023. 14 Table of Contents Investing Activities The Company did not engage in any investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Financing Activities Net cash flows provided by financing activities were 14,875 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of a 16,305 from the issuance of 54,100 shares of Class A common stock for proceeds of 16,305 and a net decrease in advances from our DRO of 4,302. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s applications of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for our company include revenue recognition and accounting for stock-based compensation, use of estimates, and income taxes. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management in the accompanying financial statements include but are not limited to the fair value of stock-based compensation and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Adoption of New Accounting Principles The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
