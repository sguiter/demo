CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
quarterly report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may , should , expects ,
 plans , anticipates , believes , estimates , predicts , potential 
or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. 

These
statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry s
actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. While these forward-looking statements, and any
assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business,
actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future
performance suggested herein. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we
cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the
securities laws of the United States we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to
actual results. 

Factors
that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this Report, including
under Risk Factors , and in other reports the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC 
 or the Commission ), including the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024
(under the heading Risk Factors and in other parts of that report), which factors include: 

Because
 of the nature of the exploration of natural resource properties, there is substantial risk that this business will fail. 

If
 we cannot compete successfully for financing and for qualified managerial and technical employees, our exploration program may suffer. 

Exploration
 and exploitation activities are subject to comprehensive regulation which may cause substantial delays or require capital outlays
 in excess of those anticipated, causing an adverse effect on our company. 

There
 are no known reserves of minerals on our mineral claims, and we cannot guarantee that we will find any commercial quantities of minerals. 

Because
 the probability of an individual prospect ever having reserves is extremely remote, any funds spent on exploration may be lost. 

We
 have a limited operating history and as a result there is no assurance we can operate on a profitable basis. 

If
 we do not obtain additional financing, our business will fail, and our investors could lose their investment. 

Because
 there is no assurance that we will generate revenues, we face a high risk of business failure. 

The
 existence of our mining claims depends on our ability to fund exploratory activity or to pay fees. 

Our
consolidated financial statements are stated in United States Dollars US and are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP for interim financial statements. The following discussion
should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly
report. As used in this quarterly report, the terms we , us , the Company , and Liberty
Star mean Liberty Star Uranium Metals Corp. and our subsidiaries, Hay Mountain Holdings, LLC, Earp Ridge Mines LLC and Red
Rock Mines LLC, unless otherwise indicated. All dollar amounts refer to U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.

or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. With the exception of the derivative liabilities, the fair value of these financial
instruments approximates their carrying values based on their short maturities or for long-term debt based on borrowing rates currently
available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities. Gains and losses recognized on changes in estimated fair value of the derivative
liabilities are reported in other income (expense) as gain (loss) on change in fair value of derivative liabilities.

Key
inputs and assumptions used to value the convertible note when it became convertible and upon settlement, and warrants upon tainting,
were as follows: 

The
 stock projections are based on the historical volatilities for each date. The volatility of is based on historical prices
 over a lookback period equivalent to the expected term of years. The stock price projection was modeled such that it follows
 a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and constant volatility, starting with the recast stock price at each valuation date; 

The
 Holder will exercise the warrant at maturity if the stock price was above the exercise price; 

Discount
 rate was based on risk free rates of in effect based on the remaining term and date of each valuation and instrument; 

Dividend
 yield: ; 

Exercise
 Price: to . M/number shares issued and outstanding at maturity (exercise date); 

Number
 of Options: M/exercise price; and 

The
 shares issued and outstanding is based on the initial shares as of 10/31/21 to shares as of 10/31/24 and a
 growth (a lower growth from last quarter) monthly at 10/31/24 and future financing events raising annually through
 the sale of common stock at a discount. 

Using
the results from the model, the Company recorded a derivative liability during the nine months ended October 31, 2024 of for
the fair value of the convertible feature included in the Company s convertible debt instruments. The derivative liability recorded
for the convertible feature created a day 1 derivative loss of and a debt discount of that is being amortized
over the remaining term of the note using the effective interest rate method. Interest expense related to the amortization of this debt
discount for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, was . The remaining unamortized debt discount related to the derivative liability
was as of October 31, 2024. 

During
the nine months ended October 31, 2024, the Company recorded a gain of due to a change in the fair value of the derivative
liabilities to reflect the value of the derivative liabilities for warrants as of October 31, 2024. 

Using
the results from the model, the Company recorded a derivative liability during the nine months ended October 31, 2023 of for

Liberty
Star Uranium Metals Corp. was formerly Liberty Star Gold Corp. and formerly Titanium Intelligence, Inc. Titanium ).
Titanium was incorporated on August 20, 2001, under the laws of the State of Nevada. On February 5, 2004, we commenced operations in
the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties business. Big Chunk Corp. Big Chunk was our wholly owned subsidiary
and was incorporated on December 14, 2003, in the State of Alaska. Big Chunk is engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral
properties business in the State of Alaska. Big Chunk was dissolved on June 3, 2019. Redwall Drilling Inc. Redwall was
our wholly owned subsidiary and was incorporated on August 31, 2007, in the State of Arizona. Redwall performed drilling services on
our mineral properties. Redwall ceased drilling activities in July 2008 and was dissolved on March 30, 2010. In April 2007, we changed
our name to Liberty Star Uranium Metals Corp Liberty Star to reflect our current general exploration for base and
precious metals. We are in the exploration phase of operations and have not generated any revenues from operations. 

In
October 2014, we formed our wholly owned subsidiary, Hay Mountain Holdings LLC HMH (formerly known as Hay Mountain Super
Project LLC), to serve as the primary holding company for development of the potential ore bodies encompassed in the Hay Mountain area
of interest in Arizona. On April 11, 2019, we formed a new subsidiary named Earp Ridge Mines LLC, wholly owned by Hay Mountain Holdings
LLC, intended for engagement with future venture partners. 

On
August 13, 2020, the Company formed Red Rock Mines, LLC, an Arizona corporation, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Hay Mountain Holdings,
LLC. 

Our
Current Business 

We
are engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties in the state of Arizona and the Southwest USA. Claims in the state
of Arizona are held in the name of Liberty Star. We use the term Super Project to indicate a project in which numerous
mineral targets have been identified, any one or more of which could potentially contain commercially viable quantities of minerals.
Our significant projects are described below. 

Tombstone
Super Project Tombstone ): Tombstone is a large and ancient (72 million years before the present or Laramide
in age) volcanic structure a caldera. The US Geological Survey caldera experts conclude this is correct. Subsequently, more than
seventeen calderas of various ages have been identified in Arizona by the US Geological survey, the Arizona Geological Survey and others.
Such calderas of Laramide age are all associated with porphyry alteration and copper and associated mineralization; many of these have
become very large copper mines. Advanced technology has indicated that alteration associated mineralization at Tombstone is much more
extensive than originally thought. This alteration lies largely under cover and is indicated by geochemistry, geophysics and projection
of known geology into covered areas. 

18 

All
the properties summarized below are considered as Exploration stage properties under the definition of SK1300 and are considered
 non-material properties. 

The
Hay Mountain Property: The Hay Mountain Property is located 6.5 miles southeast of Tombstone where we hold 35 Arizona State Mineral
Exploration Permits (MEPs) covering (12,878.18 acres) or 20.12 square miles, and 93 federal lode mining claims covering (1,594.68 acres)
or 2.49 square miles and is accessible by Hwy 80, Davis Rd. and Wild West Road. 

At
Hay Mountain, we plan to ascertain whether the Hay Mountain lode mining claims and AZ MEPs possess commercially viable deposits of copper,
gold, molybdenum, silver, zinc, rare earth metals and other valuable metals. We have a phased exploration plan that involves diamond
drilling of multiple holes over targets determined by analysis of geochemical sampling and ZTEM electromagnetic and magnetic survey.
Initial phase 1 drilling is planned to take approximately one year. Should results indicate the viability of the property, additional
phased work, both exploration and development, is planned over the course of seven total years to define the nature and size of any potential
ore bodies and move toward mining. Any exploration plans are dependent on acquiring suitable funding. No part of the phased program is
currently funded. 

From
early December 2023 until March 4, 2024, we drilled the first two holes of our Phase 1 drilling project in the Hay Mountain Property.
Hole HM-23-01 was 1,500 deep and hole HM-23-02 was 3,437 deep. The first two holes do not provide a sufficient data set
to prepare an estimate of the overall mineral resources under S-K 1300. These holes were designed as a test of concept 
to check the results of the previous geochemical and geophysical work done by us in the past. Hole HM-23-01 was not drilled deep enough
to encounter alteration nor mineralization and will be deepened at a future date. Hole HM-23-02 did encounter alteration and mineralization
associated with a copper porphyry system, with trace level copper values found in the intrusive rock to 0.1 . Further drilling will be
required in this area to begin to understand the scope and source of that mineralization. 

Holes
01 and 02 are the first two holes of a much larger phase of planned drilling to be conducted in 2024. A full technical report on the
drilling program will be prepared at the conclusion of phase one. 

On
November 25, 2020, the Company received approval from the Arizona State Land Department for 5 additional MEP s covering 2,369.15
acres for a total of 16,662.10 acres or 26.03 square miles at our Hay Mountain Property. 

From
July 14th to August 5 th , 2020, field mapping was conducted on the Hay Mountain Property, located 7 km southeast of Tombstone,
in Cochise County, Arizona. The purpose of mapping was to identify alteration and veining associated with an inferred porphyry copper
system at depth, determine the extent of hydrothermal alteration, and comment on the possible timing of emplaced mineralization. Mapping
was conducted at 1:10,000 scale and a total of 183 carbonate vein samples were taken for XRF analysis and UV fluorescence response. 

Robbers
Roost exploration property : On June 16, 2020, the Company acquired 2 Mineral Exploration Permits MEP covering
240 acres at Robbers Roost. Which is located 5.89 miles west of the Hay Mountain Project. While the Robbers Roost MEP area is new to
the Company, it has been explored previously by several exploration companies, in the 1970 s and 1990 s, and recently has
received significant interest by others operating in the area. Drilling by ASARCO indicates the presence of a granodioritic porphyry
intrusive at depth below the alteration zone. The intrusive is characterized by porphyry copper style alteration and mineralization. 
(JB Nelson, Robbers Roost Summary Report, 1995, p. 2 http://docs.azgs.az.gov/SpecColl/2008-01/2008-01-0103.pdf) 

Red
Rock Canyon exploration property : As of mid-March 2024, the Company is currently conducting a statistical sampling program on the
property. Channel samples are cut using a handheld rock saw across the jasperoid lenses at measured lengths and spacing between the channels.
QA/QC samples are being inserted into the sample stream as per Industry Standard . Results are pending. 

On
August 20, 2021, the Company executed a financing agreement for the purpose of drilling for the Red Rock Canyon Gold Property in Cochise
County, Arizona. The agreement allowed for a 1,000,000 common stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement and a
 1,000,000 warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement, together the Agreements with Triton Funds LP Triton of San Diego, California under a Form S-1 registration now effective. As of December 31, 2022, the purchase agreement expired. 

19 

On
May 26, 2021, the Company announced the public release of geochemical assay results prepared by ALS/USA Inc. The Company noted in its
news release issued May 21, 2021 that the results were forthcoming. Previously released geochemical assay results from October 2020 and
February 2021 can be viewed on the Liberty Star Minerals website. This set of results strongly aligns with previous assay results indicating
that the Red Rock portion of the Hay Mountain Project is a potential gold property. 

On
March 15, 2021, the Company announced the release of more rock chip assay results from the Red Rock Canyon area located within the Hay
Mountain Project. 28 samples were submitted to the ALS/USA Inc. Tucson location with results returned to the Company February 6, 2021.
This set of samples are within and outside of the original study area and expand on the October 2020 geochemical sampling undertaken
on MEP land within the Company s Red Rock Canyon holdings. 

On
November 11, 2020, the Company announced the identification of potentially exploitable gold mineralization on its recently acquired Arizona
State Land Department Mineral Exploration Permits. Preliminary surface exploration on the Red Rock MEPs advances the Company s
knowledge of the porphyry system signature associated with magnetic highs at, and adjacent to the north of, Target 1, and represent the
expansion of biogeochemical, surface rock sampling, and x-ray fluorescence XRF work continuing at Target 1 and on the
anticipated gold halo likely associated with the indicated porphyry center. The Company discovered multiple outcrops of intensely silicified
rock in the initial observational field work. These outcrops generally occur in linear features several feet in thickness with multiple
features oriented en-echelon with interstitial host country rock of varying horizontal dimension. These outcrops contain densely distributed
jasperoids, which, when sampled yield what the Company believes are potentially economically exploitable concentrations of gold. There
was a total of 23 representative (1 to 2 kg) rock sample assays. These assays demonstrate gold concentrations ranging from below detection
limits of 0.05 ppm in country rock surrounding certain outcrops to a high of 13.55 ppm in direct outcrop samples. Of the 23 assayed samples,
nine (9) show gold concentrations of 0.95 ppm or more. 

The
Tombstone exploration property : The Tombstone exploration property consists of nine claims that are undeveloped. However,
significant amounts of aeromagnetic surveys, IP (Induced Polarization Surveys), geologic mapping by the USGS and others, and geochemical
surveys including soil, rock and vegetation sampling have been conducted at various times by various parties, over the last 60 years.
When compiled and analyzed these various data suggest a compelling series of anomalies that are typical of buried, dirt and rock covered
porphyry copper system(s). Below is a summary of prior exploration activities performed on our Tombstone claims: Technical Report :
In mid-March 2011, Liberty Star contracted SRK to prepare three (3) Technical studies and Reports in a form similar to mineral reports
prescribed under NI 43-101. Members of SRK s engineering/scientific staff supervised by a Qualified Person as defined under NI
43-101 and SRK s Tucson Office Principal Geologist, Corolla Hoag, and geologist Dr. Jan Rasmussen have visited the Tombstone property. 

Title
to mineral claims involves certain inherent risks due to difficulties in determining the validity of certain claims, as well as potential
for problems arising from the frequently ambiguous conveyancing history characteristic of many mineral properties. We have investigated
title to all the Company s mineral properties and, to the best of its knowledge, title to all properties retained are in good standing. 

The
mineral resource business generally consists of three stages: exploration, development and production. Mineral resource companies that
are in the exploration stage have not yet found mineral resources in commercially exploitable quantities and are engaged in exploring
land in an effort to discover them. Mineral resource companies that have located a mineral resource in commercially exploitable quantities
and are preparing to extract that resource are in the development stage, while those engaged in the extraction of a known mineral resource
are in the production stage. We have not found any mineral resources in commercially exploitable quantities. 

There
is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on any of our properties, and further exploration is required before
we can evaluate whether any exist and, if so, whether it would be economically feasible to develop or exploit those resources. Even if
we complete our current exploration program and we are successful in identifying a mineral deposit, we would be required to spend substantial
funds on further drilling and engineering studies before we could know whether that mineral deposit will constitute a commercially viable
mineral deposit, known as an ore reserve.

SK
1300 Regulation 

Liberty
Star has performed many hours of field work mapping and sampling on our Red Rock Canyon Gold Project and although we do not have drilling
core to prove results, we have through analysis of Geochem sampling, evidence of an anomaly. 

To
date, we have not generated any revenues. Our ability to pursue our business plan and generate revenues is subject to our ability to
obtain additional financing, and we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to do so.

Summary
of Cash Flows 

Cash

Net

included payments made for geological and geophysical costs, compensation, and professional fees to our consultants, attorneys and accountants. 

Cash

Net

promissory notes and proceeds from notes payable, related party, which were offset by the repayment of advances, related party. Net cash

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements, including
the notes thereto. We consider critical accounting policies to be those that require more significant judgments and estimates in the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements, including the following: long lived assets; intangible assets valuations; and income
tax valuations. Management relies on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable in making its judgment and
estimates. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 

Management
believes its application of accounting policies, and the estimates inherently required therein, are reasonable. These accounting policies
and estimates are periodically reevaluated, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

The
term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls
and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

23 

As
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures at October 31, 2024, which is the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this report. This evaluation was carried
out by Ms. Patricia Madaris, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based on this evaluation, Ms. Patricia
Madaris has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as at the end of the period covered by this report.
Given the size of our current operation and existing personnel, the opportunity to implement internal control procedures that segregate
accounting duties and responsibilities is limited. Until the organization can increase in size to warrant an increase in personnel, formal
internal control procedures will not be implemented until they can be effectively executed and monitored. Disclosure controls and procedures
are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Management
believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended October 31,
2024, are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the quarter ended October 31, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design
of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

There
are no pending or threatened legal proceedings involving our company. However, from time to time, we may become involved in various legal
proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Those claims, even if lacking merit, could result in the expenditure by us
of significant financial and managerial resources. We may become involved in material legal proceedings in the future.

1A. Risk Factors 

Reference

should be read in conjunction with the factors set forth in Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information 
of this Report. There have been no material changes with respect to the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report, except as discussed
