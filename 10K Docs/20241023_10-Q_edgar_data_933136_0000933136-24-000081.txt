 These hypothetical sensitivities should be evaluated with care. The effect on fair value of an adverse change in assumptions generally cannot be determined because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the fair value may not be linear. Additionally, the impact of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value is calculated while holding other assumptions constant. In reality, changes in one factor may lead to changes in other factors, which could impact the above hypothetical effects.

 These hypothetical sensitivities should be evaluated with care. The effect on fair value of an adverse change in assumptions generally cannot be determined because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the fair value may not be linear. Additionally, the impact of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value is calculated while holding other assumptions constant. In reality, changes in one factor may lead to changes in other factors, which could impact the above hypothetical effects. Also, a positive change in the above assumptions would not necessarily correlate with the corresponding decrease in the net carrying amount of the excess spread financing. Excess spread financing s cash flow assumptions that are utilized in determining fair value are based on the related cash flow assumptions used in the financed MSRs. Any fair value change recognized in the financed MSRs attributable to related cash flows assumptions would inherently have an inverse impact on the carrying amount of the related excess spread financing.

 The ratios included in the indentures for the unsecured senior notes are incurrence-based compared to the customary ratio covenants that are often found in credit agreements that require a company to maintain a certain ratio. The incurrence-based covenants limit the issuer(s) and restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, make certain investments, create liens, consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of their assets or enter into certain transactions with affiliates. The indentures contain certain events of default, including (subject, in some cases, to customary cure periods and materiality thresholds) defaults based on (i) the failure to make payments under the applicable indenture when due, (ii) breach of covenants, (iii) cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, (iv) certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, (v) material judgments and (vi) invalidity of material guarantees. 
 
 The indentures provide that on or before certain fixed dates, the Company may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the unsecured senior notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at fixed redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the redemption dates, subject to compliance with certain conditions.

and , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates differed from the statutory federal rate of 21 primarily due to state income taxes and nondeductible executive compensation. 
 
 The change in effective tax rate during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, is primarily attributable to the impact of bargain purchase gain related to Home Point Acquisition, and quarterly discrete tax items relative to income before taxes for the respective period, including the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation.

Management currently believes the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is to in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters as of September 30, 2024. For some of these matters, the Company is able to estimate reasonably possible losses above existing reserves and for other matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time. This estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, numerous assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary substantially from the current estimate. 
 
 Other Loss Contingencies 
 As part of the Company s ongoing operations, it acquires servicing rights of mortgage loan portfolios that are subject to indemnification based on the representations and warranties of the seller. From time to time, the Company will seek recovery under these representations and warranties for incurred costs. As of September 30, 2024, the Company believes all recorded balances for which recovery is sought from the seller are valid claims, and no evidence suggests additional reserves are warranted. 
 
 As a seller of mortgage loans to Agencies and other third parties, the Company may be required to indemnify or repurchase mortgage loans that fail to meet certain customary representations and warranties made in conjunction with sales of mortgage loans. The repurchase reserve liability related to such customary representations and warranties was and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which are included in payables and other liabilities within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Loan and Other Commitments 
 The Company enters into IRLCs with prospective borrowers whereby the Company commits to lend a certain loan amount under specific terms and interest rates to the borrower. The Company also enters into LPCs with prospective sellers. These loan commitments are treated as derivatives and are carried at fair value. See Note 8, Derivative Financial Instruments , for more information.

 CAUTIONS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, projections, strategies, core initiatives, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are not statements of historical facts. When used in this discussion, the words anticipate, appears, believe, foresee, intend, should, expect, estimate, project, plan, may, could, will, are likely, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements involve predictions of our future financial condition, performance, plans and strategies and are thus dependent on a number of factors including, without limitation, assumptions and data that may be imprecise or incorrect. Specific factors that may impact performance or other predictions of future actions have, in many but not all cases, been identified in connection with specific forward-looking statements. As with any projection or forecast, forward-looking statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances, and we are under no obligation to, and express disclaim any obligation, to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 
 A number of important factors exist that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: 
 
 macroeconomic and U.S. residential real estate market conditions; 
 changes in prevailing interest rates and/or changes in home prices; 
 our ability to maintain or grow the size of our servicing portfolio; 
 our ability to maintain or grow our originations volume and profitability; 
 our ability to recapture voluntary prepayments related to our existing servicing portfolio; 
 our shift in the mix of our servicing portfolio to subservicing, which is highly concentrated; 
 our ability to prevent cyber intrusions and mitigate cyber risks; 
 delays in our ability to collect or be reimbursed for servicing advances; 
 our ability to obtain sufficient liquidity and capital to operate our business; 
 disruptions in the secondary home loans market; 
 our ability to successfully implement our strategic initiatives and hedging strategies; 
 our ability to realize anticipated benefits of our previous acquisitions; 
 our ability to use our net operating loss, other tax carry forwards and certain built-in losses or deductions; 
 changes in our business relationships or changes in servicing guidelines with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae; 
 third-party credit, servicer and correspondent risks; 
 our ability to pay down debt; 
 our ability to manage legal and regulatory examinations and enforcement investigations and proceedings, compliance requirements and related costs; 
 issues related to the development and use of artificial intelligence; 
 health pandemics, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural catastrophic events; and 
 our ability to maintain our licenses and other regulatory approvals. 
 
 All of these factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and may be beyond our control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all such factors or to assess the effect of each such new factor on our business. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and any of these statements included herein may prove to be inaccurate. Given the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements, or our objectives and plans will be achieved.

 Overview 
 
 We are a leading residential mortgage servicer and originator of residential mortgage loans. Our purpose is to keep the dream of homeownership alive, and we do this as a servicer by helping mortgage borrowers (our customers) manage what is typically their largest financial asset, and by helping our investors maximize the returns from their portfolios of residential mortgages. We have a track record of significant growth, having expanded our servicing portfolio UPB from 10 billion in 2006 to 1.2 trillion as of September 30, 2024. We believe this track record reflects our strong operating capabilities, strong loss mitigation sk ills, a commitment to compliance, a customer-centric culture, a demonstrated ability to retain customers, growing origination capabilities, and significant investment in technology. 
 
 Our strategy is to position the Company for sustained growth, deliver a world-class customer experience, increase our return on tangible equity into the high teens, and act as a trusted partner for our key stakeholders. Key strategic initiatives include the following: 
 
 Strengthen our balance sheet by building capital and liquidity, and managing interest rate and other forms of risk; 
 Improve efficiency by driving continuous improvement in unit costs for Servicing and Originations segments, as well as by taking corporate actions to eliminate costs throughout the organization; 
 Sustain industry leading refinance recapture rates and grow our purchase recapture rate to a target of at least 25 ; 
 Delight our customers and keep Mr. Cooper a great place for our team members to work; 
 Reinvent the customer experience by acting as the customer s advocate and by harnessing technology to deliver digital solutions that are personalized and friction-less; 
 Use our patented Pyro mortgage-centric AI platform to transform mortgage servicing for the benefit of our customers, clients, team members, and investors; 
 Sustain the talent of our people and the culture of our organization; and 
 Maintain strong relationships with agencies, investors, regulators, and other counterparties and a strong reputation for compliance and customer service.

 Anticipated Trends 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, our Servicing segment generated income before income tax expense of 177, and our servicing portfolio grew to 1.2 trillion, which increased 32 year-over-year. Under the current interest rate environment, which included the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates during the third quarter, the Company expects downward pressure on servicing income in the fourth quarter as prepayment speeds and amortization continue to rise. In addition, the Company expects lower net interest income due to the aforementioned interest rate cuts. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, our Originations segment significantly outperformed our projections with income before income tax expense of 69 driven by increased funded volume, which was attributable to both our direct-to-consumer and correspondent channels. Total funded volume during the third quarter was 6,835, which was up 80 from the prior quarter. We expect our Originations segment to operate at normalized levels of profitability in the fourth quarter as a result of an uptick in mortgage rates since the low point in September 2024. We expect to continue growing our direct-to-consumer channel, which has benefited from the growth in our servicing portfolio. We also expect to increase volume in our correspondent channel as a result of a number of initiatives coming together, including the leveling up of our correspondent platform. Overall, the Company remains well-situated for lower interest rates. 
 
 The Company is finalizing the acquisition of certain mortgage operation assets of Flagstar, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Flagstar acquisition will increase our customer base to over 6 million customers. 
 
 While the recent inflation rate increase appears to have subsided, inflationary pressures may limit a borrower s disposable income, which can decrease a borrowers ability to enter into mortgage transactions. Inflationary pressures may also increase our operating costs. However, historically changes in interest rates have a greater impact on our financial results than changes in inflation. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or extent as the inflation rate.

 (1) Revenues - operational consists of total revenues, excluding mark-to-market. 
 
 Revenues decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to negative MSR MTM driven by a decline in mortgage rates, whereas in 2023, a positive MSR MTM was driven by an increase in mortgage rates. Revenues increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in operational revenues driven by a larger servicing portfolio. 
 
 Total expenses increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in general and administrative costs driven by growth in our MSR servicing portfolio and higher originations volume. Total other income, net decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023 primarily due to gains recorded in 2023 in connection with acquisitions, and higher interest expense from MSR financing as well as the issuances of the 2032 Notes in February 2024 and the 2029 Notes in August 2024. Partially offsetting the decrease in total other income, net was an increase in interest income primarily due to higher float income on custodial deposits as a result of growth in the MSR portfolio.

 The effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 29.1 as compared to 21.7 in 2023, and the effective tax rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 25.2 as compared to 22.3 in 2023. The change in effective tax rate is primarily attributable to bargain purchase gain related to the Home Point Acquisition, and the impact of quarterly discrete tax items relative to income before taxes for the respective period, including the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation. 

Segment Results 
 
 Our operations are primarily conducted through two segments: Servicing and Originations. 
 
 The Servicing segment performs operational activities on behalf of investors or owners of the underlying mortgages and mortgage servicing rights, including collecting and disbursing borrower payments, investor reporting, customer service, modifying loans where appropriate to help borrowers stay current, and when necessary performing collections, foreclosures, and the sale of REO. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company expanded its special servicing and subservicing offerings with the acquisition and subsequent integration of Rushmore as a brand within the Servicing segment. 
 
 The Originations segment originates residential mortgage loans through our direct-to-consumer channel, which provides refinance options for our existing customers, and through our correspondent channel, which purchases or originates loans from mortgage bankers. 
 
 Refer to Note 16, Segment Information , in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of segment results. 

Servicing Segment 
 
 The Servicing segment s strategy is to generate income by growing the portfolio and maximizing the servicing margin. We believe several competitive strengths have been critical to our long-term growth as a servicer and subservicer, including our low-cost platform that creates operating leverage, our skill in mitigating losses for investors and clients, our commitment to strong customer service, industry leading compliance management, our history of successfully boarding new loans, and the ability to retain existing customers by offering attractive purchase and refinance options. We believe that our operational capabilities are reflected in our strong servicer ratings and recent agency recognition.

 Servicing Segment Revenues 
 The following provides the changes in revenues for the Servicing segment: 
 
 Servicing - MSR operational revenue and MSR amortization increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to a larger average MSR portfolio in 2024. 
 
 The change in MSR MTM during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage rates in 2024 compared to an increase in mortgage rates in 2023. The MSR MTM changes were partially offset by MSR hedging activities during the respective periods. 
 
 Subservicing - Subservicing-related revenue remained consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily driven by fees related to a new client boarding during the first quarter of 2024, offset by deboarding of another subservicing client in third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Servicing Segment Expenses 
 Total expenses remained consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to increased expense as a result of growth in the servicing portfolio, partially offset by cost reductions. 
 
 Servicing Segment Other Income, net 
 Total other income, net increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily attributable to increased float income on custodial deposits as a result of growth in the MSR portfolio, partially offset by higher interest expense from MSR financing.

 Servicing Segment Revenues 
 The following provides the changes in revenues for the Servicing segment: 
 
 Servicing - MSR operational revenue and MSR amortization increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to a larger average MSR portfolio in 2024. 
 
 The change in MSR MTM during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage rates in 2024 compared to an increase in mortgage rates in 2023. The MSR MTM changes were partially offset by MSR hedging activities during the respective periods. 
 
 Subservicing - Subservicing fees increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily driven by a larger average subservicing portfolio due to boarding of a large new subservicing client in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Servicing Segment Expenses 
 Total expenses increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily driven by an increase in corporate and other general and administrative expenses, and servicing support fees. The increase in corporate and other general and administrative expenses was due to higher corporate allocations to the Servicing segment driven by increased headcount attributable to the acquisition of Rushmore in 2023. The increase in servicing support fees was primarily due to a larger average servicing portfolio in 2024.

 Servicing Segment Other Income, net 
 Total other income, net changed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily attributable to higher interest rates and increased float income on custodial deposits as a result of growth in the MSR portfolio, partially offset by higher interest expense from MSR financing.

 (1) Average loan amount is presented in whole dollar amounts. 
 (2) Loan delinquency is based on the current contractual due date of the loan. In the case of a completed loan modification, delinquency is based on the modified due date of the loan. Loan delinquency includes loans in forbearance. 
 
 Delinquency is an assumption in determining the mark-to-market adjustment and is a key indicator of MSR portfolio performance. Delinquent loans contribute to lower MSR values due to higher costs to service and increased carrying costs of advances.

 (1) Modifications consist of agency programs designed to adjust the terms of the loan (e.g., reduced interest rates). 
 (2) Workouts consist of other loss mitigation options designed to assist borrowers and keep them in their homes, but do not adjust the terms of the loan. 
 
 Modifications and workouts during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were comparable to 2023. Modifications and workouts increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to the continued expansion of loss mitigation programs offered by FNMA, FHLMC, and FHA, which increased borrower eligibility and resulted in an increase in successful modifications and workouts.

 See Note 3, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Related Liabilities and Note 13, Fair Value Measurements , in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the range of assumptions and sensitivities related to the fair value measurement of MSRs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Excess Spread Financing 
 
 As further disclosed in Note 3, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Related Liabilities , in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we have entered into sale and assignment agreements treated as financing arrangements whereby the acquirer has the right to receive a specified percentage of the excess cash flow generated from an MSR. 
 
 The servicing fees associated with an MSR can be segregated into (i) a base servicing fee and (ii) an excess servicing fee. The base servicing fee, along with ancillary income and other revenues, is designed to cover costs incurred to service the specified pool plus a reasonable margin. The remaining servicing fee is considered excess. We sell a percentage of the excess fee, as a method for efficiently financing acquired MSRs and the purchase of loans, however we have not done so in recent years due to the availability of lower cost sources of funding.

Table of Contents 

 Excess spread financings are recorded at fair value, and the impact of fair value adjustments on future revenues and capital resources varies primarily due to prepayment speeds and option-adjusted spread levels. See Note 3, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Related Liabilities and Note 13, Fair Value Measurements , in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the range of assumptions and sensitivities related to the measurement of the excess spread financing liability as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Originations Segment 
 
 The strategy of our Originations segment is to originate or acquire new loans and ultimately add MSRs for the servicing portfolio at a more attractive cost than purchasing MSRs in bulk transactions and to retain or recapture our existing customers by providing them with attractive refinance and purchase options. The Originations segment plays a strategically important role because its profitability is typically counter cyclical to that of the Servicing segment. Furthermore, by originating or acquiring MSRs at a more attractive cost than bulk MSR acquisitions, the Originations segment improves our overall profitability and cash flow. 
 
 Our Originations segment is one way that we help underserved consumers access the financial markets. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total originations included loans for approximately 9,100 customers with low FICOs 
 The Originations segment includes two channels: 
 
 Our direct-to-consumer DTC lending channel relies on our call centers, website and mobile apps, specially trained teams of licensed mortgage originators, predictive analytics and modeling utilizing proprietary data from our servicing portfolio to reach our existing customers who may benefit from a new mortgage. Depending on borrower eligibility, we will refinance existing loans into conventional, government or non-agency products. Through lead campaigns and direct marketing, the direct-to-consumer channel seeks to convert leads into loans and ultimately MSRs in a cost-efficient manner. 
 
 Our correspondent lending channel facilitates the acquisition of MSRs through purchasing newly originated residential mortgage loans that have been underwritten to investor guidelines. This includes both conventional and government-insured loans that qualify for inclusion in securitizations that are guaranteed by the GSEs. Our correspondent lending channel enables us to replenish servicing portfolio run-off typically at a better rate of return than traditional bulk acquisitions.

Table of Contents 

 Originations Segment Revenues 
 Total revenues increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily driven by increases in pull-through adjusted lock volumes, funded volumes and volumes of originations loans sold in both DTC and correspondent channels as a result of declining interest rates in 2024. 
 
 Originations Segment Expenses 
 Total expenses increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense, and marketing and professional service fees. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in 2024 was primarily driven by variable compensation attributable to higher originations funding volume. Marketing and professional service fees increased in 2024 primarily due to an increase in marketing costs. 
 
 Originations Segment Other Income (Expenses), Net 
 Interest income relates primarily to mortgage loans held for sale. Interest expense is associated with the warehouse facilities utilized to finance newly originated loans. There were no material changes for other income (expenses), net, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, as both interest income and interest expense increased due to higher originations volume driven by declining interest rates in 2024. 
 
 Originations Margin 
 The Originations Margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased, as compared to 2023, primarily due to lower revenue as a percentage of PTA lock volume driven by lower margins from a shift in channel mix from higher margin direct-to-consumer to lower margin correspondent. Direct-to-consumer channel mix was 34 and 48 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, and 39 and 45 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Corporate/Other 
 
 Corporate/Other includes the results of Xome s operations, the Company s unallocated overhead expenses (which include the costs of executive management and other corporate functions that are not directly attributable to our operating segments), changes in equity investments and interest expense on our unsecured senior notes. In addition, Corporate/Other includes eliminations related to intersegment hedge fair value changes. 
 
 The following table set forth the selected financial results for Corporate/Other:

 Total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were comparable with 2023. 
 
 Total expenses remained consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. Total expenses increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and benefits associated with increased headcount driven by the Roosevelt Transaction, which was completed in the third quarter of 2023, higher executive compensation, an increase in operating expenses related to Roosevelt and higher Xome exchange operating expenses in 2024. 
 44 

Table of Contents 

Interest expense increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, due to the unsecured senior note assumed from the Home Point Acquisition in the third quarter of 2023, and the issuance of the 2032 Notes in February 2024 and the 2029 Notes in August 2024. For further discussion, refer to Note 9, Indebtedness , in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Other (expense) income, net decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023 primarily due to gains recorded in 2023 in connection with acquisitions. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We measure liquidity by unrestricted cash and availability of collateralized borrowing capacity on our MSR and other debt facilities. We held cash and cash equivalents on hand of 733 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 571 as of December 31, 2023. We have sufficient borrowing capacity to support our operations. As of September 30, 2024, total available borrowing capacity for advance, warehouse, and MSR facilities was 12,901, of which 3,323 was collateralized and immediately available to draw.

 Cash Flows 
 The table below presents cash flows information: 
 Table 14. Cash Flows 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash attributable to: Operating activities 79 772 (693) Investing activities (1,497) (1,088) (409) Financing activities 
 1,597 318 1,279 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 
 179 2 177 
 
 Operating activities 
 Cash generated from our operating activities decreased to 79 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 772 in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 885 in cash generated from originations net sales activities and an increase of 187 in cash used for the repurchase of loan assets out of Ginnie Mae securitizations. 
 
 Investing activities 
 Cash used in investing activities increased to 1,497 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,088 in 2023. The increase was primarily due to additional 694 in cash used for the purchase of mortgage servicing rights in 2024 and the decrease in cash generated of 243 from proceeds on sale of mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by the change in cash used of 522 in 2023 for the acquisitions of business related to the Roosevelt Transaction and Home Point Acquisition. 
 
 Financing activities 
 Cash generated in financing activities increased to 1,597 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 318 in 2023. The increase was primarily due to cash generated of 1,750 from the issuance of the 2032 and 2029 unsecured senior notes in 2024, partially offset by decreased net borrowing of 533 from advance, warehouse and MSR facilities.

 Capital Resources 
 
 Capital Structure and Debt 
 We require access to external financing resources from time to time depending on our cash requirements, assessments of current and anticipated market conditions and after-tax cost of capital. If needed, we believe additional capital could be raised through a combination of issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness, asset-backed acquisition financing and/or cash from operations. Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions. 
 
 Financial Covenants 
 Our credit facilities contain various financial covenants, which primarily relate to required tangible net worth amounts, liquidity reserves, leverage requirements, and profitability requirements, which are measured at our primary operating subsidiary, Nationstar Mortgage LLC, as well as Cypress Loan Servicing LLC, which was acquired during the third quarter of 2023 in connection with the Roosevelt Transaction.

 Advance Facilities 
 As part of our normal course of business, we borrow money to fund servicing advances. Our servicing agreements require that we advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest payments for certain investors, and to pay taxes, insurance, foreclosure costs and various other items that are required to preserve the assets being serviced. Delinquency rates and prepayment speeds affect the size of servicing advance balances, and we exercise our ability to stop advancing principal and interest where the pooling and servicing agreements permit, where the advance is deemed to be non-recoverable from future proceeds. These servicing requirements affect our liquidity. We rely upon several counterparties to provide us with financing facilities to fund a portion of our servicing advances. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total borrowing capacity of 1,380 , of which we could borrow an additional 790. 
 
 Warehouse Facilities 
 Loan origination activities generally require short-term l iquidity in excess of amounts generated by our operations. The loans we originate are financed through several warehouse lines on a short-term basis. We typically hold the loans for approximately 30 days and then sell or place the loans in government securitizations in order to repay the borrowings under the warehouse lines. Our ability to fund current operations depends upon our ability to secure these types of short-term financings on acceptable terms and to renew or replace the financings as they expire. As of September 30, 2024 , we had a total borrowing capacity of 4,771 , of which we could borrow an additional 3,008.

MSR Facilities 
 Our MSR facilities provide financing for our servicing portfolio and investments. As of September 30, 2024 , we had a total borrowing capacity of 6,750, of which we could borrow an additional 4,715. 
 
 Unsecured Senior Notes 
 From 2021 to 2024, we completed offerings of unsecured senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2032 . In connection with the Home Point Acquisition in the third quarter of 2023, we assumed an unsecured senior note with a maturity date in 2026. In February and August 2024, we completed offerings of 1,000 and 750 unsecured senior notes due in 2032 and 2029, respectively. We pay interest semi-annually to the holders of these notes at interest rates ranging fro m 5.000 to 7.125 . For more information regarding our indebtedness, see Note 9, Indebtedness , in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, no material changes to our outstanding contractual obligations were made from the amounts previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Various elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. In particular, we have identified the following policies that, due to the judgment, estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies, are critical to an understanding of our condensed consolidated financial statements. These policies relate to fair value measurements, particularly certain fair value measurements determined to be Level 3 as discussed in Note 13, Fair Value Measurements , in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and valuation and realization of deferred tax assets. We believe that the judgment, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of these critical accounting policies on our condensed consolidated financial statements, the use of other judgments, estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition. Fair value measurements considered to be Level 3 representing estimated values based on significant unobservable inputs primarily include (i) the valuation of MSRs, and (ii) the valuation of excess spread financing. For further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to the Company s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023.

 MSR Facility. A line of credit backed by mortgage servicing rights that is used for financing purposes. In certain cases, these lines may be a sub-limit of another warehouse facility or alternatively exist on a stand-alone basis. These facilities allow for same or next day draws at the request of the borrower. 
 
 Non-Conforming Loan. A mortgage loan that does not meet the standards of eligibility for purchase or securitization by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. 
 
 Option adjusted spread OAS ). The incremental spread added to the risk-free rate to reflect embedded (prepayment) optionality and other risk inherent in the MSRs or excess spread financing used to discount future cash flows for fair value purposes. 
 
 Originations. The process through which a lender provides a mortgage loan to a borrower. 
 
 Prepayment Speed. The rate at which voluntary mortgage prepayments occur or are projected to occur. The statistic is calculated on an annualized basis and expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal balance. 
 
 Primary Servicer. The servicer that owns the right to service a mortgage loan or pool of mortgage loans. This differs from a subservicer, which has a contractual agreement with the primary servicer to service a mortgage loan or pool of mortgage loans in exchange for a subservicing fee based upon portfolio volume and characteristics. 
 
 Prime Mortgage Loan. Generally, a high-quality mortgage loan that meets the underwriting standards set by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and is eligible for purchase or securitization in the secondary mortgage market. Prime Mortgage loans generally have lower default risk and are made to borrowers with excellent credit records and a monthly income at least three to four times greater than their monthly housing expenses (mortgage payments plus taxes and other debt payments) as well as significant other assets. Mortgages not classified as prime mortgage loans are generally called either sub-prime or Alt-A. 
 
 Private Label Securitizations PLS ). Securitizations that do not meet the criteria set by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. 
 
 Pull-through adjusted PTA lock volume. Represents the expected funding from locks taken during the period. 

Real Estate Owned REO ). Property acquired by the servicer on behalf of the owner of a mortgage loan or pool of mortgage loans, usually through foreclosure or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on a defaulted loan. The servicer or a third-party real estate management firm is responsible for selling the REO. Net proceeds of the sale are returned to the owner of the related loan or loans. In most cases, the sale of REO does not generate enough to pay off the balance of the loan underlying the REO, causing a loss to the owner of the related mortgage loan. 
 
 Recapture. Voluntarily prepaid loans that are expected to be refinanced by the related servicer. 
 
 Refinancing. The process of working with existing borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans. By refinancing loans for borrowers we currently service, we retain the servicing rights, thereby extending the longevity of the servicing cash flows. 
 
 Servicing. The performance of contractually specified administrative functions with respect to a mortgage loan or pool of mortgage loans. Duties of a servicer typically include, among other things, collecting monthly payments, maintaining escrow accounts, providing periodic monthly statements to the borrower and monthly reports to the loan owners or their agents, managing insurance, monitoring delinquencies, executing foreclosures (as necessary), and remitting fees to guarantors, trustees and service providers. A servicer is generally compensated with a specific fee outlined in the contract established prior to the commencement of the servicing activities. 
 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 Servicing Advances. In the course of servicing loans, servicers are required to make advances that are reimbursable from collections on the related mortgage loan or pool of loans. There are typically three types of servicing advances: P I Advances, T I Advances and Corporate Advances. 
 
 (i) P I Advances cover scheduled payments of principal and interest that have not been timely paid by borrowers. P I Advances serve to facilitate the cash flows paid to holders of securities issued by the residential MBS trust. The servicer is not the insurer or guarantor of the MBS and thus has the right to cease the advancing of P I, when the servicer deems the next advance nonrecoverable. 
 
 (ii) T I Advances pay specified expenses associated with the preservation of a mortgaged property or the liquidation of defaulted mortgage loans, including but not limited to property taxes, insurance premiums or other property-related expenses that have not been timely paid by borrowers in order for the lien holder to maintain its interest in the property. 
 
 (iii) Corporate Advances pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in foreclosing upon, preserving defaulted loans and selling REO, including attorneys and other professional fees and expenses incurred in connection with foreclosure and liquidation or other legal proceedings arising in the course of servicing the defaulted mortgage loans. 
 
 Servicing Advances are reimbursed to the servicer if and when the borrower makes a payment on the underlying mortgage loan at the time the loan is modified or upon liquidation of the underlying mortgage loan but are primarily the responsibility of the investor/owner of the loan. The types of servicing advances that a servicer must make are set forth in its servicing agreement with the owner of the mortgage loan or pool of mortgage loans. In some instances, a servicer is allowed to cease Servicing Advances, if those advances will not be recoverable from the property securing the loan. 
 
 Servicing Fee. A servicing fee is the percentage of each mortgage payment made by a borrower to a mortgage servicer as compensation for keeping a record of payments, collecting, and making escrow payments, passing principal and interest payments along to the note holder. 
 
 Subservicing. Subservicing is the process of outsourcing the duties of the primary servicer to a third-party servicer. The third-party servicer performs the servicing responsibilities for a fee and is typically not responsible for making servicing advances, which are subsequently reimbursed by the primary servicer. The primary servicer is contractually liable to the owner of the loans for the activities of the subservicer. 
 
 Unpaid Principal Balance UPB ). The amount of principal outstanding on a mortgage loan or a pool of mortgage loans. UPB is used together with the servicing fees and ancillary incomes as a means of estimating the future revenue stream for a servicer. 
 
 U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA ). The USDA is a cabinet-level department of the U.S. federal government, which guarantees certain home loans for qualified borrowers. 
 
 Warehouse Facility. A type of line of credit facility used to temporarily finance mortgage loan originations to be sold in the secondary market. Pursuant to a warehouse facility, a loan originator typically agrees to transfer to a counterparty certain mortgage loans against the transfer of funds by the counterpart, with a simultaneous agreement by the counterpart to transfer the loans back to the originator at a date certain, or on demand, against the transfer of funds from the originator.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Refer to the discussion included in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in the types of market risks faced by us since December 31, 2023. 
 
 Sensitivity Analysis 
 We assess our market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact on fair values based on hypothetical changes (increases and decreases) in interest rates. 
 
 We use a duration-based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our loan portfolio, certain other interest-bearing liabilities measured at fair value and interest rate derivatives portfolios. The primary assumption used in these models is that an increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities. 
 
 We utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of MSRs and the impact of parallel interest rate shifts on MSRs. The discounted cash flow model incorporates prepayment speeds, OAS, costs to service, delinquencies, ancillary revenues, recapture rates and other assumptions that management believes are consistent with the assumptions that other similar market participants use in valuing the MSRs. The key assumptions to determine fair value include prepayment speed, OAS and cost to service. However, this analysis ignores the impact of interest rate changes on certain material variables, such as the benefit or detriment on the value of future loan originations, non-parallel shifts in the spread relationships between MBS, swaps and U.S. Treasury rates and changes in primary and secondary mortgage market spreads. For mortgage loans, IRLCs, forward delivery commitments on MBS and treasury futures, we rely on a model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts. In addition, the primary assumption used for IRLCs, is the borrower s propensity to close their mortgage loans under the commitment. 
 
 Our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including market volatility and the liquidity of the markets. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented, including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. 
 
 We used September 30, 2024 market rates on our instruments to perform the sensitivity analysis. The estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves. These sensitivities are hypothetical and presented for illustrative purposes only. Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in fair value may not be linear.

 (vi) If on any Funding Date, the amount on deposit in the Credit Manager Expense Reserve Accounts is less than the Credit Manager Expense Reserve Required Amount, if applicable, then the Administrator may direct the Indenture Trustee to transfer from the Collection and Funding Account to the Credit Manager Expense Reserve Account from Servicing Spread Available Funds (and during the Full Amortization Period, all Available Funds) on deposit therein, an amount equal to the amount by which the Credit Manager Expense Reserve Required Amount exceeds the amounts then on deposit in the Credit Manager Expense Reserve Account. 
 Section 4.7. Collection and Funding Account.

The Issuer, by entering into this Base Indenture, each Noteholder, by its acceptance of a Note and each purchaser of a beneficial interest therein, by accepting such beneficial interest, agree to treat such Notes (to the extent outstanding for United States federal income tax purposes) (other than any Retained Note) as debt for United States federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable law in a proceeding of final determination. The Indenture Trustee shall treat the Trust Estate as a security device only. The provisions of this Base Indenture shall be construed in furtherance of the foregoing intended tax treatment. 
 Section 14.4. Alternate Payment Provisions. 
 Notwithstanding any provision of this Base Indenture or any of the Notes to the contrary, the Issuer, with the written consent of the Indenture Trustee and the Paying Agent, may enter into any agreement with any Noteholder of a Note providing for a method of payment or notice that is different from the methods provided for in this Base Indenture for such payments or notices.

 Section 14.5. Termination of Obligations. 
 The respective obligations and responsibilities of the Indenture Trustee created hereby (other than the obligation of the Indenture Trustee to make payments to Noteholders as hereinafter set forth) shall terminate upon satisfaction and discharge of this Base Indenture as set forth in Article VII , except with respect to the payment obligations described in Section 14.6(b) . Upon this event, the Indenture Trustee shall release, assign and convey to the Issuer or any of its designees, without recourse, representation or warranty, all of its right, title and interest in the Collateral, whether then existing or thereafter created, all monies due or to become due and all amounts received or receivable with respect thereto (including all moneys then held in any Trust Account) and all proceeds thereof, except for amounts held by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section 14.6(b) . The Indenture Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments of transfer and assignment as shall be provided to it, in each case without recourse, as shall be reasonably requested by the Issuer to vest in the Issuer or any of its designees all right, title and interest which the Indenture Trustee had in the Collateral. 
 Section 14.6. Final Payment.

In the event that all such Noteholders shall not surrender their Notes for cancellation within six (6) months after the date specified in the notice from the Indenture Trustee described in clause (a) above, the Indenture Trustee shall give a second (2 nd notice to the remaining such Noteholders to surrender their Notes for cancellation and receive the final payment with respect thereto. If within one year after the second (2 nd notice all such Notes shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Indenture Trustee may take appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to contact the remaining such Noteholders concerning surrender of their Notes, and the cost thereof (including costs related to giving the second (2 nd notice) shall be paid out of the funds in the Collection and Funding Account.
