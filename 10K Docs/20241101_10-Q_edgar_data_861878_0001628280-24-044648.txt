The Company completed a settlement with the DTSC with respect to these claims and any potential claims stemming from the search warrant executed in conjunction with the DEA inspection of the Rancho Cordova facility described below. The Company made an accrual in respect of the settlement consistent with its accrual policies described above, and made the settlement payment during July 2024, the amount of which payment is not material. 
 Rancho Cordova, California, Permit Revocation. Separately, on August 15, 2019, the Company received from the DTSC a written Intent to Deny Hazardous Waste Facility Permit Application for the Rancho Cordova facility. Following legal challenges, the DTSC action became final as of April 8, 2022, triggering an obligation to execute the closure plan set forth in the facility's permit. Consistent with its accrual policies described previously, the Company has made an accrual in the amount of its estimate of closure costs reasonably likely to be incurred and indemnified to Enviri under the Purchase Agreement, which is not material. 
 DEA Investigation. On February 11, 2020, the Company received an administrative subpoena from the DEA, which executed a search warrant at the Company s former Domestic Environmental Solutions facility at Rancho Cordova, California and an administrative inspection warrant at the Company s former facility in Indianapolis, Indiana for materials related to the former Domestic Environmental Solutions business of collecting, transporting, and destroying controlled substances from retail customers (the ESOL Retail Controlled Substances Business ). On that same day, agents from the DTSC executed a separate search warrant at the Rancho Cordova facility. Since that time, the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Eastern District of California USAO EDCA has been overseeing criminal and civil investigations of the ESOL Retail Controlled Substances Business. The USAO EDCA has informed the Company that the investigations relate to the Company s operation and sale of its former ESOL Retail Controlled Substances Business and that the Company and some of its current or former employees may have civil and criminal liability under the Controlled Substances Act and other federal statutes related to that business. The Company is cooperating with the investigations, which are ongoing. 
 The Company has not accrued any amounts in respect of these investigations and cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or any range of reasonably possible losses that the Company may incur. The Company is unable to make such an estimate because, based on what the Company knows now, in the Company s judgment, the factual and legal issues presented in this matter are sufficiently unique that the Company is unable to identify other circumstances sufficiently comparable to provide guidance in making estimates.

 Certain Key Priorities and Other Significant Matters 
 The following table identifies certain key priorities and other significant matters impacting our business and how they are classified in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income:

 ERP and System Modernization 
 For the periods presented of the ERP and System Modernization, we have recognized the following, reported in Other Costs: 
 In millions Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 North America Operating expenditures 3.5 3.6 9.2 11.3 Capital expenditures 2.8 5.6 9.6 14.3 Total North America 6.3 9.2 18.8 25.6 International Operating expenditures 0.6 1.2 3.5 1.6 Capital expenditures 1.0 2.6 Total International 1.6 1.2 6.1 1.6 Total operating expenditures 4.1 4.8 12.7 12.9 Total capital expenditures 3.8 5.6 12.2 14.3 Total ERP and System Modernization 7.9 10.4 24.9 27.2 
 Upon deployment of the ERP in our U.S. RWCS business in the third quarter of 2023, certain costs became incremental information technology ongoing costs for running the new system, including maintenance, licensing, and depreciation expenses. North America continues to invest in certain ERP enhancements. Our international ERP system modernization includes enhancements and upgrades associated with European based RWCS and SID operations. We will continue to incur the current level of costs to maintain the legacy suite of applications also used by our businesses during the system modernization. 
 
 Intangible Amortization 
 See table above of certain key priorities and other significant matters for intangible amortization expenses from acquisitions for the periods presented and how they are classified in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income . The decrease in intangible amortization expense is a result of divestitures and certain intangible assets that have reached the end of their useful lives.

 Operational Optimization 
 See table above of certain key priorities and other significant matters for operational optimization for the periods presented, and how they are classified in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income. 
 In February 2024, the Company recognized Operational Optimization severance charges of 5.0 million related to a workforce reduction, in our North America and International segments, which is expected to provide annual savings of approximately 21.0 million to 24.0 million beginning in the first half of 2024. We had also reduced our overall workforce in our retained businesses through careful hiring and managing attrition which is expected to provide annual savings of approximately 11.0 million to 13.0 million in 2024. 
 In October of 2023, the Company recognized Operational Optimization charges of 4.1 million primarily related to severance associated with workforce reduction, split between North America and International segments, and closure of an International facility. These workforce reduction actions are expected to provide annual savings of approximately 8.0 million in 2024. 
 As we continue to consider each Operational Optimization activity, the amount, the timing and recognition of charges will be affected by the occurrence of commitments and triggering events as defined under U.S. GAAP, among other factors. For additional information, see Part I, Item I. Financial Statements; Note 4 Restructuring, Divestitures, and Impairments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Portfolio Optimization 
 See table above of certain key priorities and other significant matters for portfolio optimization (including Divestiture losses, net and impairments) for the periods presented, and how they are classified in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income. Consulting and professional fees are reported in Other Costs, while Divestiture losses, net and impairments are included in their respective segment. 
 
 Acquisition 
 We regularly evaluate the competitive environment and consider opportunistic acquisitions to strengthen our core businesses. We believe acquisitions, when appropriately valued and constructively integrated, are an efficient way to gain customers, scale treatment operations, and build customer density for transportation. We expect to focus on accretive tuck-in acquisitions. For additional information, see Part I, Item I. Financial Statements; Note 3 Acquisition in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Divestitures 
 We evaluate our portfolio of services on an ongoing basis with a country-by-country and service line-by-service line approach to assess long-term potential and identify potential business candidates for divestiture. Resulting divestitures or pending transactions may cause us to record significant charges, including those related to goodwill, other intangible assets, long-lived assets, and cumulative translation adjustments. 
 The Company anticipates additional impacts for the Spain and Portugal transaction related to estimated transaction costs, foreign exchange volatility, and adjustments to working capital, prior to close and subsequently based upon the terms of the applicable agreement. Operating results for the businesses will be excluded from the financial statements subsequent to the close date of the applicable transaction. 
 As part of our long-term strategy for improving profitability and return on invested capital, and more recently as part of the portfolio optimization component of Business Transformation, we continue to evaluate the performance of our entire portfolio of assets and businesses. Divestitures resulting from this strategy may cause us to record significant charges, including those related to goodwill, other intangible assets, long-lived assets, and cumulative translation adjustments. In addition, divestitures we complete may not yield the targeted improvements in our business. Any charges that we are required to record or the failure to achieve the intended financial results associated with the portfolio rationalization strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 We will continue impairment testing annually or as otherwise required by applicable accounting standards. Our evaluation is based on the assumption that these assets or businesses will continue to be operated by us until they are disposed of by us. For additional information, see Part I, Item I. Financial Statements; Note 4 Restructuring, Divestitures, and Impairments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Impairment 
 See table above of certain key priorities and other significant matters for impairments for the periods presented and how they are classified in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income. 
 2024 Q3 10-Q Report 
 Stericycle, Inc. 24 

Table of Contents 

 We perform our goodwill impairment testing annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate goodwill might be impaired. Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment and amortizing intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The recent portfolio optimization (the approved plan to exit operations and subsequent definitive agreement to divest our Spain and Portugal operations) will be factored into the annual impairment analysis related to our Europe reporting unit. We will continue to work with our third-party valuation specialists to appropriately capture these factors in our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter or if recoverability tests are required for long-lived assets. 
 Impairment charges may be recognized in future periods to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur, including deterioration in the macroeconomic environment or in the equity markets, including the market value of our common shares, deterioration in our performance or our future projections, or changes in our plans for one or more reporting units or specified long-lived assets, among other factors. For additional information, see Part I, Item I. Financial Statements; Note 4 Restructuring, Divestitures, and Impairments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance 
 We operate in highly regulated industries and must address regulatory inquiries or respond to investigations from time to time. We have also been involved in a variety of civil litigation from time to time. Certain of these matters are detailed in Part I, Item I. Financial Statements; Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our financial results may also include considerations of non-recurring matters including settlements, environmental remediation, and legal related consulting and professional fees. 
 See table above of certain key priorities and other significant matters for litigation, settlements and regulatory compliance charges. Among other things, the table reflects consulting and professional fees (including FCPA monitoring fees which commenced in 2023 and ended in the third quarter of 2024), certain contingent liability provisions and settlements, indirect tax provisions and credits impacting our business for the periods presented, primarily in Other Costs. See Part I, Item I. Financial Statements; Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. 
 
 WM Transaction Related Charges 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, in connection with the Merger, we incurred approximately 3.4 million and 11.6 million, respectively, of transaction-related expenses (legal, advisory, and other related fees), reported in SG A.

 (5) The comparisons at constant currency rates (foreign exchange) reflect comparative local currency balances at prior period s foreign exchange rates. We calculated these percentages by taking current period reported Revenues less the respective prior period reported Revenues, divided by the prior period reported Revenues, all at the respective prior period s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in Revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior and the current period. Management believes this measure aids in the understanding of changes in Revenues without the impact of foreign currency. 
 Revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were 648.4 million, a decrease of 5.1 million, or 0.8 , compared to 653.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to divestitures of 3.9 million and lower organic revenues of 3.7 million. This decrease was partially offset by acquisition related revenues of 1.4 million and favorable foreign exchange rates of 1.1 million. Organic revenues in RWCS grew 0.7 million, while SID organic revenues were lower by 4.4 million. The decline in SID was mainly due to lower commodity-indexed revenues of 4.6 million, which was partially offset by higher SID service revenues of 0.2 million.

 Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,974.9 million, a decrease of 32.4 million, or 1.6 , compared to 2,007.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to divestitures of 32.6 million and lower organic revenues of 6.9 million, which was partially offset by acquisition related revenues of 3.8 million and favorable foreign exchange rates of 3.3 million. Organic revenues in RWCS grew 16.5 million, mainly driven by pricing levers, while SID organic revenues were lower by 23.4 million. The decline in SID was mainly due to lower commodity-indexed revenues of 32.1 million, which was partially offset by higher SID service revenues of 8.7 million. 
 North America revenues decreased 2.7 million, or 0.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, to 554.4 million from 557.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Organic revenues decreased 3.5 million, or 0.7 , mainly due to continued market challenges with our national customers. Additionally, RWCS organic revenues were impacted by reduced volumes from certain maritime customers in North America, which was partially offset by our pricing levers. SID organic revenues were impacted by lower commodity-indexed revenues, which were partially offset by higher SID service revenues. 
 North America revenues decreased 4.5 million, or 0.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 1,691.2 million from 1,695.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Organic revenues decreased 7.3 million, or 0.4 , mainly as a result of lower SID commodity-indexed revenues and continued headwinds in SID service stops with our national customers, which were partially offset by higher SID service revenues. This decrease was partially offset by increased RWCS organic revenues, which was mainly driven by our pricing levers. 
 International revenues decreased 2.4 million, or 2.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, to 94.0 million from 96.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of divestitures of 3.9 million, or 4.0 and lower organic revenues of 0.2 million or 0.1 , partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rates of 1.7 million, or 1.7 . RWCS organic revenues were higher due to pricing levers and SID organic revenues were lower due to decreased service revenues. 
 International revenues decreased 27.9 million, or 9.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 283.7 million from 311.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of divestitures of 32.6 million, or 10.4 , partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rates of 4.3 million, or 1.4 and higher organic revenues of 0.4 million or 0.2 . RWCS organic revenues were higher due to pricing levers which was partially offset by lower SID organic revenues due to decreased commodity-indexed revenues coupled with lower service stops.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the 2023 comparable periods, the decreases in gross profit were partially due to lower SID commodity-indexed revenues and the corresponding margin flow through impact, primarily due to lower SOP rates. These were partially offset by cost savings and other margin flow through.

Additionally in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG A was impacted by higher bad debt expense due to a bankruptcy of a large hospital network in the second quarter of 2024 and a lower 2023 bad debt expense as a result of improved North America SID collections.

 Adjusted Income from Operations for North America decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the 2023 comparable periods, primarily as the result of lower SID commodity-indexed revenues and the corresponding margin flow through impact. This decrease was partially offset by cost savings and other margin flow through. Additionally in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, higher bad debt expense was primarily due to the bankruptcy of a large hospital network in the second quarter of 2024 and a lower 2023 bad debt expense as a result of improved North America SID collections. 
 Adjusted Income from Operations for International decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the 2023 comparable period. This decrease was primarily due to lower SID commodity-indexed revenues and the corresponding margin flow through impact, which was partially offset by the impact of divestitures, favorable RWCS pricing levers, and foreign exchange rates. 
 Adjusted Income from Operations for International increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the 2023 comparable period. This increase was primarily due to the impact of divestitures, favorable RWCS pricing levers, and foreign exchange rates, which were partially offset by lower SID commodity-indexed revenues and the corresponding margin flow through impact. 
 Adjusted Loss from Operations for Other Costs decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the 2023 comparable periods. These decreases were primarily driven by cost savings, including operational optimization initiatives, and lower incentive and stock-based compensation expense.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to support its ongoing operations and to invest in future growth to create value for its shareholders. Operating cash flows and the Company s 1.2 billion Credit Facility are the Company s primary sources of liquidity and are expected to be used for, among other things, payment of interest and principal on the Company s long-term debt obligations, and capital expenditures necessary to support growth and productivity improvements. As of September 30, 2024, we had 432.7 million of available capacity in the 1.2 billion Credit Facility.

 The Credit Agreement contains, among other covenants, a financial covenant requiring maintenance of a maximum Credit Agreement Defined Debt Leverage Ratio of 4.00 to 1.00 which includes, among other provisions, 50.0 million of cash add-backs to EBITDA with respect to any four fiscal quarter period ending on or before December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants. The Credit Agreement Defined Debt Leverage Ratio was 3.48 to 1.00, which was below the allowed maximum ratio of 4.00 to 1.00 as set forth in the amended Credit Agreement. Expiration of the 50.0 million of cash add-backs to EBITDA contributed approximately 30 points of increase to the Credit Agreement Defined Debt Leverage Ratio as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. 
 On February 1, 2024, the Company issued a redemption notice to 2019 Senior Notes holders for redemption of all of the 600 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2019 Senior Notes, and on March 14, 2024 completed the redemption with borrowings from the Credit Facility. The refinancing of the 2019 Senior Notes using the Credit Facility converted the long-term debt from fixed rate to variable rate as of the redemption date. For further details concerning these matters, see Part I, Item I. Financial Statements; Note 5 Debt in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Cash Flow Summary: 
 The following table shows cash flow information for the Company by activity: 
 In millions Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash from operating activities 56.4 193.3 Net cash from investing activities (120.6) (15.5) Net cash from financing activities 62.4 (205.2) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 0.8 1.1 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (1.0) (26.3) 
 Operating Cash Flows: Net cash provided from operating activities decreased 136.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 56.4 million from 193.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 136.9 million was mainly due to an increase in accounts receivable, net of deferred revenues of 60.9 million due to billing and collection delays from the U.S. RWCS ERP launch in September 2023; higher payments of 19.5 million related to litigation, settlements, and regulatory compliance, WM transaction related charges, and operational optimization as described above; higher annual incentive plan payments of 17.1 million; higher income tax payments of 16.4 million; higher interest payments of 7.9 million; and lower cash from operating income and other net working capital of 15.1 million. 
 DSO as reported for September 30, 2024 was 84 days or 73 days, net of deferred revenues. DSO as reported for September 30, 2023 was 63 days or 55 days, net of deferred revenues. The September 30, 2024 DSO, net of deferred revenues, was higher as compared to the same period in 2023, mainly driven by the timing of U.S. RWCS customer billing and subsequent collections associated with the ERP implementation as we continue to enhance U.S. billing presentment and collections processes. RWCS cash collections from customers have improved beginning in the third quarter compared to periods since the U.S. RWCS ERP launched in September 2023. 
 Investing Cash Flows: Net cash from investing activities decreased 105.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to an outflow of 120.6 million from 15.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by cash payments for an acquisition of 13.7 million in 2024, as compared to 84.6 million received from divestitures in 2023. Cash paid for capital expenditures increased by 6.1 million to 108.3 million in the nine months of 2024 from 102.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 Financing Cash Flows: Net cash from financing activities increased 267.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to an inflow of 62.4 million from an outflow of 205.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net borrowings on our Credit Facility and Term Loan were 679.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net payments of 108.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company redeemed all of the 600 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2019 Senior Notes on March 14, 2024 with Credit Facility borrowings.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 As discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K, the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. There were no material changes from the information provided therein.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, certain commodity prices, including SOP, diesel fuel, utilities and foreign currency rates. We do not specifically hedge our exposure to these risks. 
 We are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates which relate primarily to our financing activities. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive debt instruments (variable rate debt), which in aggregate as of September 30, 2024 were 61.6 of total aggregate debt. Our potential additional interest expense over one year that would result from a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate on all of our variable rate debt would be approximately 8.4 million on a pre-tax basis. 
 We are subject to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as SOP, diesel fuel, and utilities. For example, historically diesel fuel has been approximately five percent of our COR. As the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues, operating costs and margins may also increase or decrease. Variability in commodity prices can also impact the margins of our business as certain components of our Revenues are structured as a pass through of costs, including fuel surcharges as changes in diesel costs may offset in Revenues through our indexed fuel surcharges at certain levels of pricing. 
 There were no other material changes from the information provided in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are effective as of September 30, 2024, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , there were no changes that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

 RISKS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED MERGER 
 The proposed Merger is subject to the satisfaction of a number of closing conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied or completed within the expected timeframe, if at all. 
 Completion of the Merger is subject to a number of customary closing conditions. We can provide no assurance that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, even if all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of the completion of the Merger. Many of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any adverse consequence of the pending Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. 
 Each party s obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject in some instances to materiality or material adverse effect qualifiers) and compliance in all material respects with the covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement as of the Closing, including, with respect to us, covenants to conduct our business in the ordinary course and to not engage in certain kinds of material transactions prior to the Closing. In addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Merger will be completed, even though our stockholders approved the Merger, or that, if completed, it will be on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement or within the expected time frame.

 We may not complete the proposed Merger within the time frame we anticipate or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and/or operations. 
 The proposed Merger may not be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all, as a result of various factors and conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Stericycle common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, we will remain a public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will be required to continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Moreover, our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected, and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following: 
 we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price, and it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of the shares would return to the prices at which the shares currently trade; 
 we may experience negative publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our ongoing operations including, but not limited to, retaining and attracting employees, customers, partners, suppliers and others with whom we do business; 
 we will still be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, printing and other professional services fees, which may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than in connection with the Merger; 
 we may be required to pay a termination fee to Parent of 175.0 million, as required under the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances; 
 while the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain kinds of material transactions, which could prevent us from pursuing strategic business opportunities, taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and responding effectively and/or timely to competitive pressures and industry developments, and may as a result materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition; 
 matters relating to the Merger require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could result in the distraction of management from ongoing business operations and pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us; 
 we may commit significant time and resources to defending against litigation related to the Merger; and 
 we may encounter difficulties retaining our workforce due to the Merger. 
 If the Merger is not consummated, the risks described above may materialize, and they may have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial results and stock price, particularly to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed. 
 We will be subject to various uncertainties while the Merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers and other third-party business partners. 
 Our efforts to complete the Merger could cause substantial disruptions in, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, which may materially adversely affect our results of operation and our business. Uncertainty as to whether the Merger will be completed may affect our ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging while the Merger is pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the Merger. As mentioned above, a substantial amount of our management s and employees attention is being directed toward the completion of the Merger and thus is being diverted from our day-to-day operations. Uncertainty as to our future could adversely affect our business and our relationship with customers and potential customers. For example, customers, suppliers and other third parties may defer decisions concerning working with us, or seek to change existing business relationships with us. Changes to or termination of existing business relationships could adversely affect our revenue, earnings and financial condition, as well as the market price of Stericycle common stock. The adverse effects of the pendency of the Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.

 In certain instances, the Merger Agreement requires us to pay a termination fee to Parent, which could affect the decisions of a third party considering making an Acquisition Proposal. 
 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay Parent a termination fee of 175.0 million under specified conditions, including if we terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a Superior Proposal. This payment could affect the structure, pricing and terms proposed by a third party seeking to acquire or merge with us and could discourage a third party from making an Acquisition Proposal, including a proposal that would be more favorable to our stockholders than the Merger. 
 We have incurred, and will continue to incur, direct and indirect costs as a result of the Merger. 
 We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and expenses, including regulatory costs, fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not completed. There are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these costs and expenses. Many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the Merger is not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the Merger. 
 Litigation challenging the Merger Agreement may prevent the Merger from being consummated within the expected timeframe or at all. 
 Lawsuits may be filed against us, our Board or other parties to the Merger Agreement, challenging our acquisition by Parent and making other claims in connection therewith. Such lawsuits may be brought by our purported stockholders and seek, among other things, to enjoin consummation of the Merger. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that the consummation of the Merger is not restrained, enjoined or prohibited by any order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) of any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction or prohibited or made illegal by any applicable law, in each case, other than an immaterial order or law . As such, if the plaintiffs in such lawsuits are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the defendants from completing the Merger on the agreed upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from becoming effective, or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 There were no sales of unregistered equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in the SEC s rules).
