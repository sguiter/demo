NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 

million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had negative cash flows from operations of 
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception, generating an
accumulated deficit of 
million as of September 30, 2024. 

While
we achieved net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, at present we cannot be certain that we will be able to generate a sufficient
amount of product revenue to achieve profitability on an ongoing basis. 

The
Company continues to focus on growth in sales and managing tight expenses with the goal of returning to cash flow positive from
operations. The investment in inventory in 2024 is preparing for higher sales volumes of key products in the future. The Company
believes that the tight focus on operations and its current cash balances are sufficient to fund its current operating plan through
at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. However, if
the Company s operating results do not meet its expectations, the Company may need to further reduce discretionary
expenditures such as headcount, R D projects, and other variable costs.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in
Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion includes forward-looking statements about our business, financial
condition and results of operations including discussions about management s expectations for our business. These statements represent
projections, beliefs and expectations based on current circumstances and conditions and in light of recent events and trends, and these
statements should not be construed either as assurances of performances or as promises of a given course of action. Instead, various
known and unknown factors are likely to cause our actual performance and management s actions to vary, and the results of these
variances may be both material and adverse. 

Business
Overview 

We
are a commercial-stage company that develops and sells high performance water solutions to the medical and commercial markets. 

Our
medical water filters, mostly classified as ultrafilters, are used primarily by hospitals for the prevention of infection from waterborne
pathogens, such as legionella and pseudomonas, and in dialysis centers for the removal of biological contaminants from water and bicarbonate
concentrate. Because our ultrafilters capture contaminants as small as 0.005 microns in size, they minimize exposure to a wide variety
of bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and endotoxins. 

Our
commercial water filters improve the taste and odor of water and reduce biofilm, cysts, particulates, and scale build-up in downstream
equipment. Our products are marketed primarily to the food service, hospitality, convenience store, and health care markets, and also
sold into medical institutions to supplement our medical filters. 

We
previously held a majority stake in Specialty Renal Products, Inc. SRP ), a development-stage medical device company that
was focused primarily on developing hemodiafiltration HDF technology. In May 2022, SRP received 510(k) clearance from
the FDA for SRP s second-generation model of the OLp rH2H Hemodiafiltration System, which enables nephrologists to provide
HDF treatment to patients with end stage renal disease. In January 2023, SRP management began exploring strategic partnerships to support
a commercial launch of the HDF product but was unsuccessful in identifying a partner. By late February 2023, SRP had nearly exhausted
its capital resources and, due to its limited capital and lack of prospects for securing a strategic partnership or additional financing,
the board of directors of SRP adopted a plan on March 6, 2023 to wind down SRP operations, liquidate its remaining assets and dissolve
the company. That plan was approved by SRP s stockholders on March 9, 2023, and on April 13, 2023, SRP filed a certificate of dissolution
with the State of Delaware. SRP s cash resources were sufficient to satisfy all of its outstanding liabilities other than its obligations
to us under a loan with an outstanding balance of approximately 1.5 million. Accordingly, SRP assigned to Nephros all of its remaining
assets, including its intellectual property rights in the HDF2 device, in satisfaction of its outstanding loan balance. Although we have
no current plans to do so, we may re-evaluate opportunities for HDF in the future. 

Our
Products 

Water
Filtration Products 

We
develop and sell water filtration products used in both medical and commercial applications. Our water filtration products employ multiple
filtration technologies, as described below. 

In
medical markets, our primary filtration mechanism is to pass liquids through the pores of polysulfone hollow fiber. Our filters 
pores are significantly smaller than those of competing products, resulting in highly effective elimination of waterborne pathogens,
including legionella bacteria (the cause of Legionnaires disease) and viruses, which are not eliminated by most other microbiological
filters on the market. Additionally, the fiber structure and pore density in our hollow fiber enables significantly higher flow rates
than in other polysulfone hollow fiber. 

18 

Our
primary sales strategy in medical markets is to sell through value-added resellers VARs ). Leveraging VARs has enabled
us to expand rapidly our access to target customers with limited sales staff expansion. In addition, while we are currently focused on
medical markets, the VARs that support these customers also support a wide variety of commercial and industrial customers. We believe
that our VAR relationships have and will continue to facilitate growth in filter sales outside of the medical industry. 

In
commercial markets, we develop and sell our filters, for which carbon-based absorption is the primary filtration mechanism. These products
allow us to improve water s odor and taste, to reduce scale and heavy metals, and to reduce other water contaminants for customers
who are primarily in the food service, convenience store, and hospitality industries. These commercial products are also sold into medical
markets, as supplemental filtration to our medical filters. 

In
commercial markets, our model combines both direct and indirect sales. Through our employee sales staff, we have sold products directly
to a number of convenience stores, hotels, casinos, and restaurants. We have also signed an agreement with a partner to be the exclusive
distributor to resell select water filters and related products to customers in the commercial food and beverage markets subject to meeting
certain minimum thresholds. 

Target
Markets 

Our
ultrafiltration products currently target the following markets: 

Hospitals
 and Other Healthcare Facilities: Filtration of water for washing and drinking as an aid in infection control. The filters produce
 water that is suitable for wound cleansing, cleaning of equipment used in medical procedures, and washing of surgeons hands. 

Dialysis
 Centers and Home/Portable Dialysis Machines: Filtration of water or bicarbonate concentrate used in hemodialysis. 

Commercial
 Facilities: Filtration and purification of water for consumption, including for use in ice machines and soft drink dispensers. 

Military
 and Outdoor Recreation: Individual water purification devices used by soldiers and backpackers to produce drinking water in the field,
 as well as filters customized to remote water processing systems. 

Hospitals
and Other Healthcare Facilities. Nephros filters are a leading tool used to provide proactive protection to patients in high-risk
areas (e.g., ice machines, surgical rooms, NICUs) and reactive protection to patients in broader areas during periods of water pathogen
outbreaks. Our products are used in hundreds of medical facilities to aid in infection control, both proactively and reactively. 

As
of 2023, according to the American Hospital Association, there are approximately 6,129 hospitals in the U.S., with approximately 920,000
beds. Over 34 million patients were admitted to these hospitals. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC estimates that healthcare associated infections HAI occur in approximately 1 out of every 31 hospital patients, which
calculates to over one million patients in 2023. HAIs affect patients in hospitals or other healthcare facilities and are not present
or incubating at the time of admission. They also include infections acquired by patients in the hospital or facility, but appearing
after discharge, and occupational infections among staff. Many HAIs are caused by waterborne bacteria and viruses that can thrive in
aging or complex plumbing systems often found in healthcare facilities. 

In
January 2022, the Center for Clinical Standards and Quality at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS expanded
its requirements originally implemented in 2017 for facilities to develop policies and procedures that inhibit the growth
and spread of legionella and other opportunistic pathogens in building water systems. In this 2022 update, CMS requires teams to be assigned
to the development of formal water management plans WMPs ), as well as detailed documentation regarding the development
of the WMPs and their execution. CMS surveyors regularly review policies, procedures, and reports documenting water management implementation
results to verify that facilities are compliant with these requirements. We believe that these CMS regulations may have a positive impact
on the sale of our HAI-inhibiting ultrafilters. 

19 

We
currently have FDA 510(k) clearance on the following portfolio of medical device products for use in the hospital setting to aid in infection
control: 

The
 DSU-H and SSU-H are in-line, 0.005-micron ultrafilters that provide dual- and single-stage protection, respectively, from waterborne
 pathogens. They are primarily used to filter potable water feeding ice machines, sinks, and medical equipment, such as endoscope
 washers and surgical room humidifiers. The DSU-H has an up to 6-month product life in a typical hospital setting, while the SSU-H
 has an up to 3-month product life. 

The
 S100 is a point-of-use, 0.01-micron microfilter that provides protection from waterborne pathogens. The S100 is primarily used to
 filter potable water feeding sinks and showers. The S100 has an up to 3-month product life when used in a hospital setting. 

The
 HydraGuard TM and HydraGuard TM - Flush are 0.005-micron cartridge ultrafilters that provide single-stage protection
 from waterborne pathogens. The HydraGuard ultrafilters are primarily used to filter potable water feeding ice machines and medical
 equipment, such as endoscope washers and surgical room humidifiers. The HydraGuard has an up to 6-month product life and the HydraGuard
 - Flush has an up to 12-month product life when used in a hospital setting. 

Our
complete hospital infection control product line, including in-line, and point-of-use can be viewed on our website at https://www.nephros.com/infection-control/ .
We are not including the information on our website as a part of, nor incorporating it by reference into, this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q. 

Dialysis
Centers - Water/Bicarbonate . In the dialysis water market, Nephros ultrafiltration products are among the highest performing
products on the market. The DSU-D, SSU-D and the SSUmini have become the standard endotoxin filter in many portable reverse osmosis systems.
The EndoPur , our large-format ultrafilter targeted at dialysis clinic water systems, provides the smallest pore size
available. 

To
perform hemodialysis, all dialysis clinics have dedicated water purification systems to produce water and bicarbonate concentrate, two
essential ingredients for making dialysate, the liquid that removes waste material from the blood. According to the American Journal
of Kidney Diseases, there are approximately 7,100 dialysis clinics in the United States servicing approximately 500,000 patients annually.
We estimate that there are over 100,000 hemodialysis machines in operation in the United States. 

We
currently have FDA 510(k) clearance on the following portfolio of medical device products for use in the dialysis setting to aid in bacteria,
virus, and endotoxin retention: 

The
 DSU-D, SSU-D and SSUmini are in-line, 0.005-micron ultrafilters that provide protection from bacteria, viruses, and endotoxins. All
 of these products have an up to 12-month product life in the dialysis setting and are used to filter water following treatment with
 a reverse osmosis RO system, and to filter bicarbonate concentrate. These ultrafilters are primarily used in the
 water lines and bicarbonate concentrate lines leading into dialysis machines, and as a polish filter for portable RO machines. 

The
 EndoPur is a 0.005-micron cartridge ultrafilter that provides single-stage protection from bacteria, viruses, and endotoxins. The
 EndoPur has an up to 12-month product life in the dialysis setting and is used to filter water following treatment with an RO system.
 More specifically, the EndoPur is used primarily to filter water in large RO systems designed to provide ultrapure water to an entire
 dialysis clinic. The EndoPur is a cartridge-based, plug and play market entry that requires no plumbing at installation
 or replacement. The EndoPur is available in 10 , 20 , and 30 configurations. 

Commercial
and Industrial Facilities . Our commercial NanoGuard product line accomplishes ultrafiltration via small
pore size (0.005 micron) technology, filtering bacteria and viruses from water. In addition, our commercial filtration offerings include
technologies that are primarily focused on improving odor and taste and on reducing scale and heavy metals from filtered water. 

20 

Our
commercial market focus is on the hotel, restaurant, and convenience store markets. In March 2022, we entered into an agreement to provide
water filtration systems to an organization that services approximately 3,000 Quick Service Restaurants QSR ). Effective
January 1, 2023, we entered into a new supply agreement with this commercial partner, which superseded the March 2022 agreement. Under
the January 2023 agreement, we engaged this commercial partner to be our exclusive distributor to the food, beverage and hospitality
industries. We continue to pursue other national accounts, which, over time, may result in step-change increases in commercial market
revenue. 

Over
time, we believe that the same water safety management programs currently underway at medical facilities may migrate to commercial markets.
As the epidemiology of waterborne pathogens expands, links to contamination sources will become more efficient and the data more readily
available. In cases where those sources are linked to restaurants, hotels, office buildings and residential complexes, the corporate
owners of those facilities will likely face increasing liability exposure. We expect that building owners will come to understand ASHRAE-188,
which outlines risk factors for buildings and their occupants, and provides water safety management guidelines. We believe, in time,
most commercial buildings will need to follow the basic requirements of ASHRAE-188: create a water management plan, perform routine testing,
and establish a plan to treat the building in the event of a positive test. 

As
demand for water testing and microbiological filtration grows, we will be ready to deploy our expertise and solutions based on years
of experience servicing the medical market. We believe that we have an opportunity to offer unique expertise and products to the commercial
market, and that our future revenue from the commercial market could even surpass our infection control revenue. 

We
currently market the following portfolio of proprietary products for use in the commercial, industrial, and food service settings: 

The
 NanoGuard set of products are in-line, 0.005-micron ultrafilter that provides dual-stage retention of any organic or inorganic particle
 larger than 15,000 Daltons. NanoGuard products are designed to fit a variety of existing plumbing configurations, including 10 
 and 20 standard housings, and Nephros and Everpure manifolds. Included in the NanoGuard product line are both conventional
 and flushable filters. 

The
 Nephros line of commercial filters provide a variety of technology solutions that improve water quality in food service, convenience
 store, hospitality, and industrial applications. Nephros filters improve water taste and odor, and reduce sediment, dirt, rust particles
 and other solids, chlorine and heavy minerals, lime scale build-up, and both particulate lead and soluble lead. 

Nephros
commercial products combine effectively with NanoGuard ultrafiltration technologies to offer full-featured solutions to the commercial
water market, including to existing users of Everpure filter manifolds. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as identified in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

We
are subject to recently issued accounting standards, accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. For a description of these new
accounting standards, see Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Liquidity, of the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Interim Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Results
of Operations 

Fluctuations
in Operating Results 

Our
results of operations have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past, including recently, and are likely to continue
to do so in the future. We anticipate that our annual results of operations will be impacted for the foreseeable future by several factors,
including market acceptance of our products, expense management, and progress to achieve positive operating cash flow. Due to these fluctuations,
we believe that the period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance.

Revenue 

Overall,
net revenues decreased by 0.2 million, or 6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This
decrease was primarily driven by a decline in programmatic business reflecting underperformance in one region and a few of our larger
accounts showing slower order patterns. This decline was partially offset by an increase in emergency response business. 

Gross
Profit Margin 

Consolidated
gross margin was approximately 61 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 59 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase of approximately 2 percentage points, was driven by favorable pricing terms with our largest supplier. 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses 

Consolidated
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 416,000, or 19 , primarily due to a decrease in bonus accrual, sales commission
expense, and stock compensation expense. In addition, we had expenses in the third quarter of 2023 related to our facilities consolidation
which were not repeated in the third quarter of 2024. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Consolidated
research and development expenses decreased approximately 17,000 due to a reduction in bonus accrual. 

Depreciation
and Amortization Expense 

Depreciation
and amortization expenses were approximately 34,000 and 55,000, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. 

22 

Interest
Income 

Interest
income was approximately 20,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 11,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. 

Other
Income (Expense), net 

Other
expense of approximately 43,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily a result of losses on foreign currency transactions.
Other income of approximately 10,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily a result of gains on foreign currency
transactions.

Revenue 

Overall,
net revenues decreased by 0.7 million, or 6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This
decrease was primarily driven by decreased revenue from emergency response orders, which were unusually large in the first nine months
of 2023 but not repeated to the same degree in the comparable 2024 period. We believe that one contributor to this decline is the reduced
stringency of waterborne risk response in territories previously committed to both proactive filtration measures and robust corrective
actions. Consequently, we experienced the effects of a relaxation of requirements for emergency relief and remediation. However, the
decrease in emergency response orders was partially offset by increased revenue from programmatic or recurring sales, which were 3 more
than the same period in 2023. This increase in programmatic sales was due to the development of our newer sales personnel hired in 2023. 

Gross
Profit Margin 

Consolidated
gross margin was approximately 61 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 58 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The increase of approximately 3 percentage points was driven by more favorable pricing terms with our largest supplier
and reduced shipping expenses in the first quarter of 2024. 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses 

Consolidated
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 696,000 or 11 primarily due to a decrease in bonus accrual, sales commission
expense, stock compensation expense, and travel expenses offset in part by an increase in salary expense. 

23 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Consolidated
research and development expenses decreased 11,000 primarily due to the wind down of our SRP division offset by an increase in headcount. 

Depreciation
and Amortization Expense 

Depreciation
and amortization expenses were approximately 101,000 and 163,000, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense was approximately 1,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 

Interest
Income 

Interest
income was approximately 66,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 36,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

Other
Income (Expense), net 

Other
expense was approximately 29,000 and 12,000 respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 and is
primarily a result of losses on foreign currency transactions. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
following table summarizes our liquidity and capital resources as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and is intended to supplement
the more detailed discussion that follows. The amounts stated are expressed in thousands.

At
September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 144.7 million and we may incur additional operating losses from operations until
such time, if ever, that we are able to increase product sales and/or licensing revenue to achieve profitability. 

Based
on cash that is available for our operations and projections of our future operations, we believe that our cash balances will be sufficient
to fund our current operating plan through at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of the condensed consolidated financial
statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additionally, our operating plans are designed to help control operating costs, to
increase revenue, and to raise additional capital until such time as we generate sufficient cash flows to fund operations. If there were
a decrease in the demand for our products due to either economic or competitive conditions, or if we are otherwise unable to achieve
our plan or achieve our anticipated operating results, there could be a significant reduction in liquidity due to our possible inability
to cut costs sufficiently. In such event, the Company may need to take further actions to reduce its discretionary expenditures, including
further reducing headcount, reducing spending on R D projects, and reducing other variable costs. 

24 

Our
future liquidity sources and requirements will depend on many other factors, including: 

the
 market acceptance of our products, and our ability to effectively and efficiently produce, market and sell our products; 

the
 costs involved in filing and enforcing patent claims and the status of competitive products; and 

the
 cost of litigation, including potential patent litigation and any other actual or threatened litigation. 

We
expect to put our current capital resources toward the development, marketing, and sales of our water filtration products and working
capital purposes. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating
activities of approximately 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities in 2024
was primarily due to an increase in inventory of approximately 0.8 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately
 0.5 million each, and a net loss of approximately 0.3 million, offset by an increase in inventory impairments and write-offs of approximately
 0.2 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was primarily due to a decline in inventory of approximately 0.8 million,
an increase in accrued expenses of approximately 0.4 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of approximately
 0.2 million. 

Net
cash used in investing activities was approximately 50,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to purchases of
property and equipment. We had no investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
cash used in financing activities was approximately 4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to payments on
finance leases. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily
due to final principal payments on since-retired debt. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not
required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely manner. Management
recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives. Because there are inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud have been or will be detected. 

At
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were
effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the important information in the section entitled Forward Looking Statements, 
you should carefully consider the Risk Factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023 for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or
implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently
known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial might materially adversely affect our actual business, financial condition and/or
operating results. You should also consider the following risk factor: 

We
are subject to minimum purchase obligations under our License and Supply Agreement with Medica and failure to meet these minimum purchase
requirements may result in termination of the agreement, which could materially impact our ability to obtain our filtration products. 

On
December 11, 2023, we entered into a license and supply agreement (the License and Supply Agreement with Medica S.p.A. Medica ), an Italy-based medical product manufacturing company, for the marketing and sale of certain filtration products
based upon Medica s proprietary ultrafiltration technology in conjunction with our filtration products (collectively, the Products ),
and to engage in an exclusive supply arrangement for the Products. Under the License and Supply Agreement, Medica granted us an exclusive
license, with right of sublicense, to market, promote, distribute, offer for sale and sell the Products in the Territory (as defined
in the License and Supply Agreement). In addition, we granted to Medica an exclusive license under our intellectual property to make
the Products during the term of the License and Supply Agreement. 

In
exchange for the rights granted, we have agreed to make minimum annual aggregate purchases from Medica of 4,208,000, 4,629,000,
 4,976,000, 5,349,000 and 5,750,000 for the years 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively. If we are unable to satisfy our remaining minimum purchase commitment for 2024, we will be in breach
of the License and Supply Agreement, giving Medica a right of termination. If the License and Supply Agreement is terminated, we may
be unable to obtain our filtration products from an alternative supplier on commercially favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable
to obtain our filtration products from an alternative supplier, we may be unable to supply our products to our customers, which could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and damage our reputation.
