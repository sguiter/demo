 and , respectively. The comparability of our year-over-year effective tax rate is affected by the write-off of Scripps Networks goodwill in 2023, the majority of which was non-deductible. Differences between our effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate are the impact of state taxes, foreign taxes, non-deductible expenses, changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions, excess tax benefits or expense from the exercise and vesting of share-based compensation awards million expense in 2024 and million expense in 2023), state deferred rate changes million expense in 2024 and million benefit in 2023) and state NOL valuation allowance changes.

 Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and any time events occur or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit, or respective indefinite-lived intangible asset, is below its carrying value. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, changes in business climate, sustained declines in the price of our stock, or other factors resulting in lower cash flow related to such assets. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss is recognized. The reporting unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, market growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and strategic business plans (inputs of which are categorized as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy). Additionally, future changes in these assumptions and estimates with respect to long-term growth rates and discount rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2023, we determined it was likely that the fair value of our Scripps Networks reporting unit may be below its carrying value at June 30, 2023. Following completion of our second quarter 2023 testing, we recognized a million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. 
 
 Upon completing our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2023, we determined that the fair value of our Local Media reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than and that an additional million goodwill impairment charge was necessary for the Scripps Networks reporting unit. Given that the fair value of the Scripps Networks reporting unit currently approximates carrying value, this reporting unit is more sensitive to changes in assumptions regarding its fair value. While we believe the estimates and judgments used in determining the fair values were appropriate, these estimates of fair value assume certain levels of growth for the business, which, if not achieved, could impact the fair value and possibly result in an impairment of the goodwill in future periods. For example, a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value of the Scripps Networks reporting unit by approximately million.

 Scripps Senior Secured Credit Agreement 
 
 On July 31, 2023, we entered into the Eighth Amendment to the Third Amended Restated Credit Agreement ("Eighth Amendment"). Under the terms of the Eighth Amendment, we have a million Revolving Credit Facility that matures on January 7, 2026. Commitment fees of to per annum, based on our leverage ratio, of the total unused commitment are payable under the Revolving Credit Facility. Interest is payable on the Revolving Credit Facility at rates based on the secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR"), plus a margin based on our leverage ratio, ranging from to . As of September 30, 2024, we had million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility with an interest rate of . The weighted-average interest rate over the period during which we had a drawn revolver balance in 2024 was . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million and million, respectively, under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 On October 2, 2017, we issued a million term loan B which was due to mature in October 2024 ("2024 term loan"). On July 31, 2023, we borrowed million on the Revolving Credit Facility to pay off the remaining principal balance of the 2024 term loan. The weighted-average interest rate on the 2024 term loan was for the period the loan was outstanding during 2023. 
 
 On May 1, 2019, we issued a million term loan B ("2026 term loan") that matures in May 2026. Interest is currently payable on the 2026 term loan at a rate based on SOFR, plus a fixed margin of . The 2026 term loan requires annual principal payments of million. Deferred financing costs and original issuance discount totaled approximately million with this term loan, which are being amortized over the life of the loan. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the interest rate on the 2026 term loan was and , respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on the 2026 term loan was and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 On January 7, 2021, we issued an million term loan B ("2028 term loan") that matures in January 2028. Interest is currently payable on the 2028 term loan at a rate based on SOFR, plus a fixed margin of . Additionally, the credit agreement states the SOFR rate could not be less than for our term loans that mature in 2026 and 2028. The 2028 term loan requires annual principal payments of million. We incurred deferred financing costs totaling million related to this term loan and a previous amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, which are being amortized over the life of the term loan. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the interest rate on the 2028 term loan was and , respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on the 2028 term loan was and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Senior Secured Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit our ability to incur additional debt and provides for restrictions on certain payments (dividends and share repurchases). Additionally, we must be in compliance with certain leverage ratios in order to proceed with acquisitions. Our credit agreement also includes a provision that in certain circumstances we must use a portion of excess cash flow to repay debt. We granted the lenders pledges of our equity interests in our subsidiaries and security interests in substantially all other personal property including cash, accounts receivables and equipment. The Eighth Amendment contains a covenant to comply with a maximum first lien net leverage ratio when we have outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. Through December 31, 2024, we must comply with a maximum first lien net leverage ratio of to 1.0, at which point it steps down to times through September 30, 2025, and then steps down to times thereafter. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants. 
 
 2029 Senior Secured Notes 
 
 On December 30, 2020, we issued million of senior secured notes (the "2029 Senior Notes"), which bear interest at a rate of per annum and mature on January 15, 2029. The 2029 Senior Notes were priced at of par value and interest is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15. Prior to January 15, 2026, we may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at applicable redemption prices noted in the indenture agreement. If we sell certain of our assets or have a change of control, the holders of the 2029 Senior Notes may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes.

 Our respective business segment results reflect the impact of intercompany carriage agreements between our local broadcast television stations and our national networks. We also allocate a portion of certain corporate costs and expenses, including accounting, human resources, employee benefit and information technology to our business segments. These intercompany agreements and allocations are generally amounts agreed upon by management, which may differ from an arms-length amount. 
 The other segment caption aggregates our operating segments that are too small to report separately. Costs for centrally provided services and certain corporate costs that are not allocated to the business segments are included in shared services and corporate costs. These unallocated corporate costs would also include the costs associated with being a public company. Corporate assets are primarily cash and cash equivalents, property and equipment primarily used for corporate purposes and deferred income taxes. 
 
 Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the operating performance of our business segments and makes decisions about the allocation of resources to our business segments using a measure called segment profit. Segment profit excludes interest, defined benefit pension plan amounts, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, divested operating units, restructuring activities, investment results and certain other items that are included in net income (loss) determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 Executive Overview 
 
 The E.W. Scripps Company Scripps is a diverse media enterprise that serves audiences and businesses through a portfolio of more than 60 local television stations in more than 40 markets and national news and entertainment networks. Our local stations have programming agreements with ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX. The Scripps Networks reach nearly every American through national news outlets Scripps News and Court TV and popular entertainment brands ION, Bounce, Grit, ION Mystery, ION Plus and Laff. We also serve as the longtime steward of one of the nation's largest, most successful and longest-running educational programs, the Scripps National Spelling Bee. Additionally, we provide a television viewing device called Tablo that allows households to watch and record dozens of free, over-the-air and streaming channels anywhere in their home without a subscription. 
 
 Scripps is a leader in free, ad-supported television. All of our local stations and national networks reach consumers over the air, and all of our television brands can also be found on free streaming platforms. We have continued to expand in the fast-growing connected television marketplace, and we are leveraging our leadership position in the growing over-the-air marketplace. Currently, one in three non pay-TV homes is watching television over the air alongside their streaming subscription services, and as cord-cutting and streaming service price increases continue, over-the-air channels will be an important part of television viewers' choices. To that end, Scripps continues efforts to broaden antenna use even more, and is working with key partners in retail, manufacturing and antenna installation to help television owners understand the quality and quantity of programming available over the air and the ease of antenna use. During 2024, we continue our efforts to build awareness, grow the broadcast marketplace and improve consumers over-the-air television experiences through our Tablo product. 
 
 In January 2023, we announced a strategic restructuring and reorganization of the Company to further leverage our strong position in the U.S. television ecosystem and propel our growth across new distribution platforms and emerging media marketplaces. The strategic restructuring and reorganization created a leaner and more agile operating structure through the centralization of certain services and the consolidation of layers of management across our operating businesses and corporate office. The strategic reorganization effort was substantially completed by the end of the 2024 second quarter and has resulted in more than 40 million in annual savings, of which 20 million of the annualized savings was achieved by the end of 2023. 
 
 In April 2024, we began a public process to explore the sale of our Bounce multi-cast television network. Bounce, which is available in approximately 98 of U.S. television broadcast homes, broadcasts a combination of syndicated shows, movies and original content that is created for Black audiences. 

F-20 

On July 2, 2024, we announced a multi-year agreement with the National Hockey League's Florida Panthers ("Panthers"), which begins with the 2024-2025 season. Under the new agreement, we have the ability to televise all locally produced Panthers preseason, regular-season and round one games of the postseason with distribution on cable, satellite and over-the-air television. 
 
 On September 27, 2024, we announced we will significantly reduce Scripps News' national network programming after November 15, 2024. Scripps News will no longer broadcast over the air, although it will remain on streaming and digital platforms with weekday live coverage from the field. Beginning at the start of 2025, the scaled back Scripps News operation is expected to generate annualized net savings of 35 million. 
 
 Preferred stock dividends declared and paid in the first nine months of 2023 totaled 36.0 million. We did not declare or provide payment for any of the 2024 quarterly dividends. We currently have sufficient liquidity to pay the scheduled dividends on the preferred shares; however, this action provides us better flexibility for accelerating deleveraging and maximizing the paydown of our traditional bank debt. Under the terms of the preferred shares, we are prohibited from paying dividends on and repurchasing our common shares until all preferred shares are redeemed. 

Results of Operations 
 The trends and underlying economic conditions affecting the operating performance and future prospects differ for each of our business segments. Accordingly, you should read the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations in conjunction with the discussion of the operating performance of our business segments that follows. 
 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Consolidated results of operations were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 Change 2023 2024 Change 2023 Operating revenues 646,300 14.1 566,529 1,781,393 6.2 1,677,143 Cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization (317,486) (1.2) (321,227) (973,126) 2.8 (946,511) Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization (154,781) 4.7 (147,849) (452,006) 0.7 (448,997) Restructuring costs (12,665) (4,705) (18,653) (29,208) Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets (38,861) (38,588) (116,017) (115,759) Impairment of goodwill (686,000) Gains (losses), net on disposal of property and equipment (727) (1,066) (717) (2,320) Operating income (loss) 121,780 53,094 220,874 (551,652) Interest expense (54,442) (56,916) (161,482) (158,029) Defined benefit pension plan income 152 251 506 519 Miscellaneous, net 447 1,309 16,849 131 Income (loss) from operations before income taxes 67,937 (2,262) 76,747 (709,031) Benefit (provision) for income taxes (20,161) (1,391) (25,916) 17,009 Net income (loss) 47,776 (3,653) 50,831 (692,022) 
 
 Operating revenues increased 79.8 million or 14 in the third quarter of 2024 and 104 million or 6.2 in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to prior periods. The quarter-to-date increase was due to an increase in political revenue of 122 million partially offset by a 30.2 million decrease in core advertising revenue and a 12.1 million decrease in distribution revenue. The year-to-date increase was driven by an increase of 160 million in political revenue and a 22.6 million increase in distribution revenue that were partially offset by a 75.7 million decrease in core advertising revenue. 
 
 Cost of revenues, which is comprised of programming costs and costs associated with distributing our content, decreased 3.7 million or 1.2 in the third quarter of 2024 and increased 26.6 million or 2.8 in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to prior periods. Programming expense decreased 2.2 million or 1.0 in the third quarter of 2024 and increased 22.5 million or 3.6 in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to prior periods. During 2023, we entered into sports 
 F-21 

rights contracts for the airing of games for the Women's National Basketball Association ("WNBA"), the National Women's Soccer League ("NWSL") and the Vegas Golden Knights and the Utah Hockey Club (formerly the Arizona Coyotes) in the National Hockey League ("NHL"). The NHL contracts began with the start of the 2023-2024 season in October 2023 and the NWSL contract began with the start of the 2024 season in March 2024. The sports rights fees for the contracts increased programming expense by 3.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 22.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to prior periods. For the quarter-to-date period, network programming decreased 5.8 million which more than offset the increase in sports rights fees. The year-to-date increase in cost of revenues was also due to a 6.1 million increase in production costs, driven by the television production costs associated with the airing of games under our sports agreements. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of sales, marketing and advertising expenses, research costs and costs related to corporate administrative functions. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.9 million or 4.7 in the third quarter of 2024 and 3.0 million or 0.7 in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to prior periods. The quarter-to-date increase was primarily attributed to political sales activities. 
 
 Restructuring costs totaled 12.7 million and 4.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Year-to-date restructuring costs totaled 18.7 million and 29.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the third quarter of 2024, we incurred 10.9 million in severance charges related to the significant reduction of Scripps News' national news programming. Remaining restructuring costs in 2024 include severance charges and outside consulting fees associated with the strategic reorganization efforts. Year-to-date 2023 costs included a 13.6 million first quarter charge related to the write-down of certain programming assets in connection with the shutdown of the TrueReal network. Additionally, year-to-date 2023 restructuring costs also included employee severance related charges of 8.9 million, operating lease impairment charges of 1.1 million and other restructuring charges primarily attributed to strategic reorganization consulting fees. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased 0.3 million for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 when compared to prior periods. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2023, we recorded a 686 million non-cash charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill associated with our Scripps Networks reporting unit. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 2.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 and increased 3.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to prior periods. The quarter-to-date decrease in interest expense was primarily attributed to financing costs incurred during the third quarter of 2023 related to the amendment of our credit facility. The year-to-date increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher year-over-year interest rates on our variable debt borrowings. 
 
 On February 9, 2024, following the completed sale of Broadcast Music, Inc. ("BMI") to New Mountain Capital, we received 18.1 million in pre-tax cash proceeds for our equity ownership in BMI. We did not have any carrying value associated with our BMI investment. This gain was included in Miscellaneous, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 34 and 2.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The comparability of our year-over-year effective tax rate is affected by the write-off of Scripps Networks goodwill in 2023, the majority of which was non-deductible. Differences between our effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate are the impact of state taxes, foreign taxes, non-deductible expenses, changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions, excess tax benefits or expense from the exercise and vesting of share-based compensation awards 3.9 million expense in 2024 and 1.4 million expense in 2023), state deferred rate changes 2.1 million expense in 2024 and 1.1 million benefit in 2023) and state NOL valuation allowance changes. Additionally, the 2023 year-to-date income tax provision was impacted by a net discrete tax provision benefit of 16.9 million related to book impairment of tax deductible goodwill recognized in the second quarter of 2023.

Business Segment Results As discussed in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, our chief operating decision maker evaluates the operating performance of our business segments using a measure called segment profit. Segment profit excludes interest, defined benefit pension plan amounts, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, divested operating units, restructuring activities, investment results and certain other items that are included in net income (loss) determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Items excluded from segment profit generally result from decisions made in prior periods or from decisions made by corporate executives rather than the managers of the business segments. Depreciation and amortization charges are the result of decisions made in prior periods regarding the allocation of resources and are, therefore, excluded from the measure. Generally, our corporate executives make financing, tax structure and divestiture decisions. Excluding these items from measurement of our business segment performance enables us to evaluate business segment operating performance based upon current economic conditions and decisions made by the managers of those business segments in the current period. 
 Our respective business segment results reflect the impact of intercompany carriage agreements between our local broadcast television stations and our national networks. We also allocate a portion of certain corporate costs and expenses, including accounting, human resources, employee benefit and information technology to our business segments. These intercompany agreements and allocations are generally amounts agreed upon by management, which may differ from an arms-length amount. 
 The other segment caption aggregates our operating segments that are too small to report separately. Costs for centrally provided services and certain corporate costs that are not allocated to the business segments are included in shared services and corporate costs. These unallocated corporate costs would also include the costs associated with being a public company. Corporate assets are primarily cash and cash equivalents, property and equipment primarily used for corporate purposes and deferred income taxes. 
 
 Information regarding the operating performance of our business segments and a reconciliation of such information to the condensed consolidated financial statements is as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 Change 2023 2024 Change 2023 Segment operating revenues: Local Media

Local Media Our Local Media segment includes more than 60 local television stations and their related digital operations. It is comprised of 18 ABC affiliates, 11 NBC affiliates, nine CBS affiliates and four FOX affiliates. We also have 11 independent stations and 10 additional low power stations. Our Local Media segment earns revenue primarily from the sale of advertising to local, national and political advertisers and retransmission fees received from cable operators, telecommunications companies, satellite carriers and over-the-top virtual MVPDs. 
 National television networks offer affiliates a variety of programming and sell the majority of advertising within those programs. In addition to network programs, we broadcast internally produced local and national programs, syndicated programs, sporting events and other programs of interest in each station's market. News is the primary focus of our locally produced programming. 
 The operating performance of our Local Media group is most affected by local and national economic conditions, particularly conditions within the automotive and services categories, and by the volume of advertising purchased by campaigns for elective office and political issues. The demand for political advertising is significantly higher in the third and fourth quarters of even-numbered years.

Renewals on over 25 of subscriber households were completed at the end of the first quarter of 2023, renewals on an additional 20 of subscriber households were completed throughout the second quarter of 2023 and the remainder of the renewals were completed throughout the third quarter of 2023. In the quarter-to-date period, year-over-year rates remained flat, but mid-single-digit subscriber declines unfavorably impacted distribution revenues. In the year-to-date period, distribution revenues were favorably impacted by rate increases of 11 which were partially offset by mid-single-digit subscriber declines. Local Media revenues were also impacted by decreases in core advertising revenues of 13.0 million or 9.2 in the third quarter of 2024 and 28.3 million or 6.5 in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to prior periods, due in part to displacement from political advertising. 
 
 Costs and expenses 
 
 Employee compensation and benefits increased 2.2 million or 2.0 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in bonus compensation. Employee compensation and benefits decreased 1.7 million or 0.5 in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the prior period as savings achieved through our restructuring efforts were partially offset by an increase in bonus compensation. 
 
 F-24 

Programming expense increased 1.8 million or 1.5 in the third quarter of 2024 and 17.9 million or 4.9 in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to prior periods. Costs attributed to the Vegas Golden Knights and the Utah Hockey Club (formerly the Arizona Coyotes) sports rights agreements increased programming expense by 0.8 million and 12.0 million in the quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods, respectively. The remaining year-to-date increase in programming expense was due to a 5.8 million increase in network affiliation fees. 
 
 Other expenses increased 2.6 million or 5.8 in the third quarter of 2024 and 17.3 million or 13 in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to prior periods. Production costs increased 0.7 million and 5.7 million in the quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily driven by the costs associated with airing of games under our sports agreements. Additionally, professional services cost, primarily attributed to political sales activities, increased 2.3 million and 3.4 million in the quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods, respectively. The year-to-date increase was also due to higher advertising and promotion costs of 3.6 million. 
 
 Scripps Networks Our Scripps Networks segment includes national news outlets Scripps News and Court TV and popular entertainment brands ION, Bounce, Grit, ION Mystery, ION Plus and Laff. The networks reach nearly every U.S. television home through free over-the-air broadcast, cable/satellite, connected TV and digital distribution. Our Scripps Networks segment earns revenue primarily through the sale of advertising. The advertising received by our national networks can be subject to seasonal and cyclical variations and is most impacted by national economic conditions. 
 Operating results for our Scripps Networks segment were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 Change 2023 2024 Change 2023 Total operating revenues 201,672 (6.4) 215,393 619,670 (6.5) 663,095 Segment costs and expenses: Employee compensation and benefits 31,364 2.4 30,630 91,126 (3.5) 94,383 Programming 87,693 (4.1) 91,459 275,329 2.1 269,543 Other expenses 40,554 (7.1) 43,643 123,753 (10.1) 137,639 Total costs and expenses 159,611 (3.7) 165,732 490,208 (2.3) 501,565 Segment profit 42,061 (15.3) 49,661 129,462 (19.9) 161,530 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Scripps Networks revenues, which are primarily comprised of advertising revenues, decreased 13.7 million or 6.4 in the third quarter of 2024 and 43.4 million or 6.5 in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to prior periods. Excluding the impact of the low-margin programmatic product we began to sunset in the second quarter of 2023, Scripps Networks revenues decreased 5.3 and 4.5 in the quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods, respectively. The amount of advertising revenue we earn is a function of the pricing negotiated with advertisers, the number of advertising spots sold and the audience impressions delivered. Lower ratings in our key monetized demographics unfavorably impacted Scripps Networks revenues by 10 and 8.4 in the quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods, respectively. Lower ratings were partially offset by an increase in advertising spots sold which increased revenues by 1.7 and 2.2 in the quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods, respectively. 
 
 Costs and expenses 
 
 Employee compensation and benefits increased 0.7 million or 2.4 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in bonus compensation. Employee compensation and benefits decreased 3.3 million or 3.5 for the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the prior period driven by the savings achieved through our restructuring efforts. 
 
 Programming expense decreased 3.8 million or 4.1 in the third quarter of 2024 and increased 5.8 million or 2.1 for the first nine months of 2024 when compared to prior periods. Costs attributed to the sports rights agreements with the Women's National Basketball Association and the National Women's Soccer League increased programming expense by 3.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 10.8 million for the first nine months of 2024 when compared to prior periods. Network programming decreased 4.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 7.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 when compared to prior periods. 
 
 F-25 

Other expenses decreased 3.1 million or 7.1 in the third quarter of 2024 and 13.9 million or 10 for the first nine months of 2024 when compared to prior periods. Excluding the impact of the low-margin programmatic product we began to sunset in the second quarter of 2023, other expenses decreased 2.9 in the third quarter of 2024 and 2.0 for the first nine months of 2024, primarily driven by lower marketing and promotion costs. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary source of liquidity is our available cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our primary source of cash is generated from our ongoing operations and can be affected by various risk and uncertainties. At the end of September 30, 2024, we had 34.6 million of cash on hand and 403 million of additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. Based on our current business plan, we believe our cash flow from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the Company s operating needs for the next 12 months. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 212,389 49,137 Net cash used in investing activities (41,676) (44,731) Net cash used in financing activities (171,390) (6,581) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents (677) (2,175) 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities increased 163 million in 2024 compared to 2023 driven by a 74.6 million year-over-year increase in segment profit, an 111 million increase in cash provided by changes in certain working capital accounts and a cash outlay decrease of 34.1 million for programming investments in excess of programming amortization, which were partially offset by a 25.4 million increase in income taxes paid and an increase of 7.8 million in cash interest paid. The increase in cash provided by changes in working capital accounts was primarily driven by advertising for political campaigns, which are generally paid in advance. 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 41.7 million in 2024 compared to 44.7 million in 2023. On February 9, 2024, following the completed sale of Broadcast Music, Inc. ("BMI") to New Mountain Capital, we received 18.1 million in pre-tax cash proceeds for our equity ownership in BMI. This increase in cash provided by investing activities was more than offset by 58.9 million of capital expenditures in 2024. Capital expenditures in 2023 were 43.8 million. 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 
 Cash used in financing activities was 171 million in 2024 compared to 6.6 million in 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 175 million and 330 million, respectively, outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, resulting in net debt payments of 155 million during the first nine months of 2024. During the first nine months of 2023, we had net debt proceeds of 340 million, reflecting borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. On July 31, 2023, we borrowed 283 million on the Revolving Credit Facility to pay off the remaining principal balance of our term loan maturing in October 2024. Preferred stock dividends declared and paid were 36.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Debt 
 
 On July 31, 2023, we entered into the Eighth Amendment to the Third Amended Restated Credit Agreement ("Eighth Amendment"). Under the Eighth Amendment, we have a 585 million Revolving Credit Facility that matures on January 7, 2026. In connection with our credit agreement, we also have 1.3 billion of outstanding balance on our term loans as of September 30, 2024. The annual required principal payments on these term loans total 15.6 million and the earliest maturity date for any of the loans is May of 2026. 
 
 F-26 

As of September 30, 2024, we also have 1.3 billion of senior notes outstanding. Senior secured notes totaling 523 million bear interest at a rate of 3.875 per annum and mature on January 15, 2029. Senior unsecured notes have a total outstanding principal balance of 818 million. The senior unsecured notes that mature on July 15, 2027 bear interest at 5.875 per annum and the senior unsecured notes that mature on January 15, 2031 bear interest at a rate of 5.375 per annum. 
 Debt Covenants 
 
 Our term loans and notes do not have maintenance covenants. The earliest maturity of our term loans and notes is the second quarter of 2026. The Eighth Amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in the first quarter of 2026, permits a maximum leverage through December 31, 2024 of 5.0 times the two-year average earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as defined by our credit agreement. The maximum leverage covenant steps down to 4.75 times through September 30, 2025, and then steps down to 4.50 times thereafter. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants. 
 
 Debt Repurchase Program 
 
 In February 2023, our Board of Directors provided a new repurchase authorization, pursuant to which we may reduce, through redemptions or open market purchases and retirement, a combination of the outstanding principal balance of our senior secured and senior unsecured notes. The authorization permits an aggregate principal amount reduction of up to 500 million and expires on March 1, 2026. 
 
 Equity 
 
 On January 7, 2021 we issued 6,000 shares of series A preferred stock, having a face value of 100,000 per share. 
 The preferred shares are perpetual and will be redeemable at the option of the Company beginning on the fifth anniversary of issuance, and redeemable at the option of the holders in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the terms of the preferred shares), in each case at a redemption price of 105 of the face value, plus accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared). Preferred stock dividends declared and paid in the first nine months of 2023 totaled 36.0 million. We did not declare or provide payment for any of the 2024 quarterly dividends. We currently have sufficient liquidity to pay the scheduled dividends on the preferred shares; however, this action provides us better flexibility for accelerating deleveraging and maximizing the paydown of our traditional bank debt. At September 30, 2024, aggregated undeclared and unpaid cumulative dividends totaled 41.4 million. In connection with the issuance of the preferred shares, Berkshire Hathaway also received a warrant to purchase up to 23.1 million Class A shares, at an exercise price of 13 per share. 
 
 Under the terms of the preferred shares, we are prohibited from paying dividends on and repurchasing our common shares until all preferred shares are redeemed. 
 
 Other 
 During the remainder of 2024, we anticipate contributing an additional 0.5 million to fund the SERPs' benefit payments. We have met regulatory funding requirements for our qualified benefit pension plan and do not have a mandatory contribution in 2024.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires us to make a variety of decisions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures, including the selection of appropriate accounting principles and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgment based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances, including our historical experience, actuarial studies and other assumptions. We are committed to incorporating accounting principles, assumptions and estimates that promote the representational faithfulness, verifiability, neutrality and transparency of the accounting information included in the financial statements. 
 
 Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies we have selected for use in the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in estimates that are likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. We believe the accounting for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and pension plans to be our most critical accounting policies and estimates. A detailed description of these accounting policies is included in the Critical Accounting Policies section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Recent Accounting Guidance 
 Refer to Note 2. Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Standards of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Earnings and cash flow can be affected by, among other things, economic conditions and interest rate changes. We are also exposed to changes in the market value of our investments. 
 Our objectives in managing interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. We may use derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in interest rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure, and we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
 We are subject to interest rate risk associated with our credit agreement, as borrowings bear interest at the secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR") plus respective fixed margin spreads or spreads determined relative to our Company s leverage ratio. Accordingly, the interest we pay on our borrowings is dependent on interest rate conditions and the timing of our financing needs. A 100 basis point increase in SOFR would increase annual interest expense on our variable rate borrowings by approximately 14.4 million. 
 The following table presents additional information about market-risk-sensitive financial instruments: 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 (in thousands) Cost Basis Fair Value Cost Basis Fair Value Financial instruments subject to interest rate risk: Revolving credit facility 175,000 175,000 330,000 330,000 Senior secured notes, due in 2029 523,356 389,900 523,356 463,170 Senior unsecured notes, due in 2027 425,667 372,459 425,667 378,843 Senior unsecured notes, due in 2031 392,071 225,441 392,071 286,212 Term loan, due in 2026 723,116 705,038 728,825 727,914 Term loan, due in 2028 545,000 489,138 551,000 546,179 Long-term debt, including current portion 2,784,210 2,356,976 2,950,919 2,732,318 Financial instruments subject to market value risk: Investments held at cost 21,308 (a) 21,169 (a) (a) Includes securities that do not trade in public markets, thus the securities do not have readily determinable fair values. On February 9, 2024, following the completed sale of Broadcast Music, Inc. ("BMI") to New Mountain Capital, we received 18.1 million in pre-tax cash proceeds for our equity ownership in BMI. We did not have any carrying value associated with our BMI investment. Other than our equity interest in BMI, we estimate the fair values of our other investments to approximate their carrying values at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Scripps management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 1. pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 
 2. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and 
 3. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, collusion and the improper overriding of controls by management. Accordingly, even effective internal control can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time. 
 The effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was evaluated as of the date of the financial statements. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 There were no changes to the Company's internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
