to , based on the amount of EAM s adjusted gross revenues, excluding EULAV Securities' distribution revenues Revenues Interest ). The non-voting profits interest entitles the Company to receive of EAM's profits, subject to certain limited adjustments as defined in the EAM Trust Agreement Profits Interest ). The Revenues Interest and at least of the Profits Interest are to be distributed each quarter to all interest holders of EAM, including Value Line. The Company's Revenues Interest in EAM excludes participation in the service and distribution fees of EAM's subsidiary EULAV Securities. The Company reflects its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM as non-operating income under the equity method of accounting. Although the Company does not have control over the operating and financial policies of EAM, pursuant to the EAM Trust Agreement, the Company has a contractual right to receive its share of EAM's revenues and profits. 

The Company classifies its equity securities and available-for-sale fixed income securities as current assets to properly reflect its liquidity and to recognize the fact that it has liquid assets available-for-sale should the need arise. 

Market valuations of securities listed on a securities exchange and ETF shares are based on the closing sales prices on the last business day of each month. The market value of the Company's fixed maturity U.S. Government debt securities is determined utilizing publicly quoted market prices. Cash equivalents consist of investments in money market funds that invest primarily in U.S. Government securities valued in accordance with rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. 

The Fair Value Measurements Topic of FASB's ASC defines fair value as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment in a timely transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. The Fair Value Measurements Topic established a three-tier hierarchy to maximize the use of observable market data and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to the information that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Examples of risks include those inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value such as the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Inputs are classified as observable or unobservable. 

Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the factors market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. 

The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels listed below. 

Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical investments 

 Level 2 other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.) 

 Level 3 significant unobservable inputs (including the Company s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments) 

The following summarizes the levels of fair value measurements of the Company s investments: 

Equity securities 

Available-for-sale fixed income securities 

Equity securities 

Available-for-sale fixed income securities 

The Company had no other financial instruments such as futures, forwards and swap contracts. For the periods ended October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, there were no Level 3 investments. The Company does not have any liabilities that are subject to fair value measurement.

Investment in Unconsolidated Entities: 

Equity Method Investment: 

As of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, the Company's investment in EAM Trust on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets was and , respectively. 

The value of VLI s investment in EAM at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024 reflects the fair value of contributed capital of at inception which included of cash and liquid securities in excess of working capital requirements contributed to EAM s capital account by VLI, plus VLI's share of non-voting revenues and non-voting profits from EAM less distributions, made quarterly to VLI by EAM, during the period subsequent to its initial investment through the dates of the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. 

It is anticipated that EAM will have sufficient liquidity and earn enough profit to conduct its current and future operations so the management of EAM will not need additional funding. 

The Company monitors its Investment in EAM Trust for impairment to determine whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to the following: (a) a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, (b) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, (c) a significant adverse change in the general market condition of the industry in which the investee operates, or (d) factors that raise significant concerns about the investee s ability to continue as a going concern such as negative cash flows, working capital deficiencies, or noncompliance with statutory capital and regulatory requirements. EAM did not record any impairment losses for its assets during the fiscal years 2025 or 2024. 

The components of EAM s investment management operations, provided to the Company by EAM, were as follows:

non-voting profits interest in EAM, the adviser to the Value Line asset management and mutual fund distribution businesses. EAM is considered to be a VIE in relation to the Company. The Company makes its determination for consolidation of EAM as a VIE based on a qualitative assessment of the purpose and design of EAM, the terms and characteristics of the variable interests in EAM, and the risks EAM is designed to originate and pass through to holders of variable interests. Other than EAM, the Company does not have an interest in any other VIEs. 

The Company has determined that it does not have a controlling financial interest in EAM because it does not have the power to direct the activities of EAM that most significantly impact its economic performance. Value Line does not hold any voting stock of EAM and it does not have any involvement in the day-to-day activities or operations of EAM. Although the EAM Trust Agreement provides Value Line with certain consent rights and contains certain restrictive covenants related to the activities of EAM, these are considered to be protective rights and therefore Value Line does not maintain control over EAM. 

In addition, although EAM is expected to be profitable, there is a risk that it could operate at a loss. While all of the profit interest shareholders in EAM are subject to variability based on EAM s operations risk, Value Line s non-voting revenues interest in EAM is a preferred interest in the revenues of EAM, rather than a profits interest in EAM, and Value Line accordingly believes it is subject to proportionately less risk than other holders of the profits interests. 

The Company has not provided any explicit or implicit financial or other support to EAM other than what was contractually agreed to in the EAM Trust Agreement. Value Line has no obligation to fund EAM in the future and, as a result, has no exposure to loss beyond its initial investment and any undistributed revenues and profits interests retained in EAM. The following table presents the total assets of EAM, the maximum exposure to loss due to involvement with EAM, as well as the value of the assets and liabilities the Company has recorded on its Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets for its interest in EAM.

Income Tax Payments: 

The Company made income tax payments as follows: 

Federal income tax payments 

and in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. 

The components of comprehensive income included in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income and Changes in Shareholders' Equity for the six months ended October 31, 2023 are as follows: 

billion, above total assets of billion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at October 31, 2023. 

The Company s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM entitle it to receive quarterly distributions in a range of to of EAM s revenues (excluding distribution revenues) from EAM s mutual fund and separate account business and of the residual profits of EAM (subject to temporary increase in certain limited circumstances). The Voting Profits Interest Holders will receive the other of residual profits of EAM. Distribution is not less than of EAM s profits payable each fiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement. Value Line s percent share of EAM s revenues is calculated each fiscal quarter. 

EAM Trust - VLI's non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests: 

The Company holds non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM which entitle the Company to receive from EAM an amount ranging from to of EAM's investment management fee revenues from its mutual fund and separate accounts business. EAM currently has no separately managed account clients. The Company recorded income from its non-voting revenues interest and its non-voting profits interests in EAM as follows: 

Non-voting profits interest in EAM 

At October 31, 2024, the Company's investment in EAM includes a receivable of representing the quarterly distribution of the non-voting revenues share and non-voting profits share. That amount was subsequently paid timely to the Company. 

Transactions with Parent: 

During the six months ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, the Company was reimbursed and , respectively, for payments it made on behalf of and for services the Company provided to the Parent Company, Arnold Bernhard and Co., Inc. ("Parent"). There were no receivables from the Parent on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024. 

The Company is a party to a tax-sharing arrangement with the Parent which allocates the tax liabilities of the two Companies between them. The Company made no federal tax payments to the Parent during the six months ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023. 

From time to time, the Parent has purchased additional shares of common stock of the Company in the market when and as the Parent has determined it to be appropriate. The Parent may make additional purchases of common stock of the Company from time to time in the future. As of October 31, 2024, the Parent owned of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.

Income tax provision 

On December 22, 2017 H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), was enacted. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. federal income tax rate ("Federal Tax Rate") from 35 to 21 effective January 1, 2018. Accordingly, the Company computes Federal income tax expense using the Federal Tax Rate of in fiscal year 2019 and each year thereafter. 

The overall effective income tax rates, as a percentage of pre-tax ordinary income for the six months ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023 were and , respectively. The higher effective tax rate during six months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to October 31, 2023, is primarily a result of a increase in the state and local income tax rate to from due to changes in state and local income tax allocations. The Company's annualized overall effective tax rate fluctuates due to a number of factors, in addition to changes in tax law, including but not limited to an increase or decrease in the ratio of items that do not have tax consequences to pre-income tax, the Company's geographic profit mix between tax jurisdictions, taxation method adopted by each locality, new interpretations of existing tax laws and rulings and settlements with tax authorities. 

Deferred income taxes, a liability, are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities. The tax effect of temporary differences giving rise to the Company's long-term deferred tax liability are as follows: 

Deferred non-cash post-employment compensation 

Depreciation and amortization 

Unrealized gain/(loss) on securities held for sale 

Right of Use Asset 

Deferred charges 

Other 

Total federal tax liability 

State and local tax liabilities (benefits):

Deferred non-cash post-employment compensation

Unrealized gain/(loss) on securities held for sale 

Other 

Total state and local tax liabilities 

Deferred tax liability, long-term 

At the end of each interim reporting period, the Company estimates the effective income tax rate to apply for the full fiscal year. The Company uses the effective income tax rate determined to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis and reflects the tax effect of any tax law changes and certain other discrete events in the period in which they occur. 

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory income tax rate to pretax income as a result of the following: 

Increase (decrease) in tax rate from: 

State and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 

Effect of dividends received deductions 

Other, net 

Effective income tax rate 

The Company believes that, as of October 31, 2024, there were no material uncertain tax positions that would require disclosure under GAAP. 

The Company is included in the consolidated federal income tax return of the Parent. The Company has a tax sharing agreement which requires it to make tax payments to the Parent equal to the Company's liability/(benefit) as if it filed a separate return. Beginning with the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, the Company files combined income tax returns with the Parent on a unitary basis in certain states. 

The Company s federal income tax returns (included in the Parent s consolidated returns) and state and city tax returns for fiscal years ended 2021 through 2023, are subject to examination by the tax authorities, generally for three years after they are filed with the tax authorities.

square feet of office space located on the second and third floors at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY Building or Premises beginning on December 1, 2016 and ending on November 29, 2027. Base rent under the sublease agreement is per annum during the first year with an annual increase in base rent of scheduled for each subsequent year, payable in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month, subject to customary concessions in the Company s favor and pass-through of certain increases in utility costs and real estate taxes over the base year. The Company provided a security deposit represented by a letter of credit in the amount of in October 2016, which was reduced to on October 3, 2021 and is to be fully refunded after the sublease ends. This Building became the Company s new corporate office facility. The Company is required to pay for certain operating expenses associated with the Premises as well as utilities supplied to the Premises. Sublandlord provided Value Line a work allowance of which accompanied with the six months free rent worth was applied against the Company s obligation to pay rent at our NYC headquarters. 

From 2016 to 2024, the Company s subsidiary VLDC and Seagis Property Group LP (the Landlord entered into a lease agreement, pursuant to which VLDC leased square feet of warehouse and appurtenant office space located at Lyndhurst, NJ Warehouse ). Base rent under the Lease was per annum. The Company provided a security deposit in cash in the amount of , which has been fully refunded after the Company vacated the premises. VLDC distributed Value Line s print publications from the Warehouse. The Company has outsourced to U.S. contractors the functions formerly performed at the Warehouse. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . This ASU requires that, for leases longer than one year, a lessee recognizes in the statements of financial position a right-of-use asset, representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, representing the liability to make lease payments. It also requires that for finance leases, a lessee recognizes interest expense on the lease liability, separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statements of earnings, while for operating leases, such amounts should be recognized as a combined expense. The firm adopted this ASU in May 2019 under a modified retrospective approach. 

The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 using a modified retrospective transition approach as of the Effective Date as permitted by the amendments in ASU 2018-11, which provides an alternative modified retrospective transition method. As a result, the Company was not required to adjust its comparative period financial information for effects of the standard or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the date of adoption (i.e. May 1, 2019). The Company has elected to employ the transitionary relief offered by the FASB and, therefore, has not reassessed (1) whether existing or expired contracts contain a lease, (2) lease classification for existing or expired leases or (3) the accounting for initial direct costs that were previously capitalized. 

The Company leases office space in New York, NY. The Company has evaluated that lease and determined that it is an operating lease under the definitions of the guidance of ASU 2016-02. 

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the net present value of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. For operating leases, the right-of-use asset is subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the net present value of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received. 

On May 1, 2019, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset in the amount of , which represents the lease liability of adjusted for previously recorded unamortized lease incentives in the amount of . The right-of-use asset will be amortized over the remaining lease term in the amount equal to the difference between the calculated straight-line expense of the total lease payments less the monthly interest calculated on the remaining lease liability. As of October 31, 2024, the Company had a long-term lease asset of , solely related to our NYC headquarters, located at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY, recorded in property and equipment in its consolidated balance sheets. The VLDC lease at 205 Chubb Ave., Lyndhurst, NJ ended on April 30, 2024. 

The Company recognizes lease expense, calculated as the remaining cost of the lease allocated over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis. Lease expense is presented as part of continuing operations in the consolidated condensed statements of income. The Company recognized and in lease expenses in both fiscal years 2025 and 2024 during the six months ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, respectively. 

For the six months ended October 31, 2024, the Company paid in rent relating to the leases. As a payment arising from an operating lease, the is classified within operating activities in the consolidated condensed statements of cash flows. 

The Company s leases have not provided an implicit interest rate, and therefore the Company estimated an incremental borrowing rate, or IBR, as of the commencement date, to determine the present value of its operating lease liabilities. The IBR is defined under ASC 842 as the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The following table reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments to the total operating lease liabilities recognized on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as of October 31, 2024:

As described in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company deconsolidated its investment management business in December 2010 and therefore no longer reports the investment management operation as a separate business unit. Although VLI continues to receive significant cash flows from these operations through its non-controlling investment in EAM, it no longer considers this to be a reportable business segment because it does not satisfy one of the required characteristics of an operating segment pursuant to ASC 280-10-50-1. Specifically, VLI s Chief Executive Officer does not regularly review EAM s operating results to make decisions about resources to be allocated to EAM.

Executive Summary of the Business 

The Company's core business is producing investment periodicals and their underlying research and making available certain Value Line copyrights, Value Line trademarks and Value Line Proprietary Ranks and other proprietary information, to third parties under written agreements for use in third-party managed and marketed investment products and for other purposes. Value Line markets under well-known brands including Value Line , the Value Line logo , The Value Line Investment Survey , Smart Research, Smarter Investing and The Most Trusted Name in Investment Research . The name "Value Line" as used to describe the Company, its products, and its subsidiaries, is a registered trademark of the Company. EULAV Asset Management Trust EAM was established to provide the investment management services to the Value Line Funds, institutional and individual accounts and provide distribution, marketing, and administrative services to the Value Line Mutual Funds ("Value Line Funds"). The Company maintains a significant investment in EAM from which it receives payments in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests. 

The Company s target audiences within the investment research field are individual investors, colleges, libraries, and investment management professionals. Individuals come to Value Line for complete research in one package. Institutional licensees consist of corporations, financial professionals, colleges, and municipal libraries. Libraries and universities offer the Company s detailed research to their patrons and students. Investment management professionals use the research and historical information in their day-to-day businesses. The Company has a dedicated department that solicits institutional subscriptions. 

Payments received for new and renewal subscriptions and the value of receivables for amounts billed to retail and institutional customers are recorded as unearned revenue until the order is fulfilled. As the orders are fulfilled, the Company recognizes revenue in equal installments over the life of the particular subscription. Accordingly, the subscription fees to be earned by fulfilling subscriptions after the date of a particular balance sheet are shown on that balance sheet as unearned revenue within current and long-term liabilities. 

The investment periodicals and related publications (retail and institutional) and Value Line copyrights and Value Line Proprietary Ranks and other proprietary information consolidate into one segment called Publishing. The Publishing segment constitutes the Company s only reportable business segment. 

Asset Management and Mutual Fund Distribution Businesses 

Pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company maintains an interest in certain revenues of EAM and a portion of the residual profits of EAM but has no voting authority with respect to the election or removal of the trustees of EAM or control of its business. 

23

The business of EAM is managed by its trustees each owning 20 of the voting interest in EAM and by its officers subject to the direction of the trustees. The Company s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM entitle it to receive a range of 41 to 55 of EAM s revenues (excluding distribution revenues) from EAM s mutual fund and separate account business and 50 of the residual profits of EAM (subject to temporary increase in certain limited circumstances). The Voting Profits Interest Holders will receive the other 50 of residual profits of EAM. Distribution is not less than 90 of EAM s profits payable each fiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement. 

Business Environment 

The U.S. economy, after showing signs of slowing down during the first three months of calendar 2024, reaccelerated in the second and third quarters. The nation s gross domestic product expanded by an estimated 2.8 in the September period, building on the 3.0 advance recorded in the June quarter. The growth was fueled by a hearty 3.5 increase in personal consumption expenditures. The consumer sector, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation s output, has proven resilient amid higher inflation and elevated lending rates the last few years. 

The economic advance came as the Federal Reserve began to reverse course from its most restrictive monetary policy stretch in four decades in an effort to rein in inflation. The Fed looks close to achieving its goal, as the pace of both consumer and producer (wholesale) price growth eased further over the summer and, to a lesser extent, fall months and moved closer to the central bank s target growth rate of 2 . This gave the lead bank the confidence to reduce the federal funds rate by three quarters of a percentage point, to a range of 4.50 to 4.75 , through the November Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. 

The central bank also is keeping a watchful eye on the labor market, which is the other part of its dual mandate. Initial weekly unemployment claims were running at a level indicative of a tight labor market this fall, but other metrics suggest that overall conditions are softening a bit. Our sense is that the state of the job market going forward will play a big role in how much the Federal Reserve reduces the benchmark short-term interest rate in 2025. An interest-rate pause may also be in the cards during the early part of next year, if the economy continues to expand and the incoming Trump Administration s pro-growth agenda including tax cuts and regulation rollbacks sparks a reacceleration in demand for goods and ultimately the pace of price growth. 

As 2024 drew to a close, the Federal Reserve appeared close to achieving its goal of taming inflation, which jumped to a 40-year high in June, 2022, without leading to a sharp deterioration in the U.S. labor market or pushing the economy into recession. Nationwide output is getting a boost from a still-vibrant consumer sector, which saw spending jump on a year-over-year basis during the early part of the holiday shopping season. The strength of the consumer sector has offset continued contraction in manufacturing and uneven performances from the housing and homebuilding industries. This has provided a supportive backdrop for Corporate America and the U.S. stock market. 

In all, the business environment held up very well during calendar 2024, with profit growth for S P 500 companies averaging around 6 in the third quarter after rising by a low double-digit rate in the June period. This earnings growth was likely needed to justify the Index s high price-to-earnings multiple, which at the end of November was above both its five- and 10-year averages.

Investment periodicals and related publications revenues 

Investment periodicals and related publications revenues of 12,469,000 (excluding copyright fees) during the six months ended October 31, 2024 were 3.0 below publications revenues of 12,855,000 in the prior fiscal year. The Company continued actions to attract new subscribers through various marketing channels, primarily direct mail, e-mail, and by the efforts of our sales personnel. As fewer individual investors manage their own portfolios, particularly in volatile markets, total product line circulation at October 31, 2024, was 2.3 below total product line circulation at October 31, 2023. 

Circulation also reflected management s decision to reduce marketing efforts temporarily while the challenging stock market environment persisted during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024. Total print circulation at October 31, 2024 was 2.6 below the total print circulation at October 31, 2023. During the six months ended October 31, 2024, print publication revenues of 4,414,000 decreased 6.3 , below print publication revenues of 4,709,000 during the corresponding period of 2024 because we deferred advertising in light of negative sentiment among prospective individual customers in a challenging market environment. Total digital circulation at October 31, 2024 was 1.8 below total digital circulation at October 31, 2023. During the six months ended October 31, 2024, digital revenues of 8,055,000 were slightly lower when compared to the prior fiscal year. These figures reflect weak investor sentiment, likely temporary, and the ongoing shift from our print services to digital counterparts. Sales of our higher-price, higher-profit, publications have been stronger than sales of lower price starter products. 

Value Line serves primarily individual and professional investors in stocks, and other securities, who pay mostly on annual or multi-year subscription plans, for basic services or as much as 100,000 or more annually for comprehensive premium quality research, not obtainable elsewhere. 

The Value Line Proprietary Ranks (the Ranking System ), a component of the Company s flagship product, The Value Line Investment Survey , are also utilized in the Company s copyright business. The Ranking System is made available to EAM for specific uses without charge. During the twelve month period ended October 31, 2024, the combined Ranking System Rank 1 2 stocks increase of 35.2 compared to the Russell 2000 Index s increase of 31.6 during the comparable period. 

Copyright fees 

During the six months ended October 31, 2024, copyright fees of 5,256,000 were 19.1 below those during the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. These fees depend on the assets under management in financial products with contractual arrangements to use the Ranks and other Value Line proprietary information. 

Investment management fees and services (unconsolidated) 

The Company has substantial non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM, the asset manager to the Value Line Mutual Funds. Accordingly, the Company does not report this operation as a separate business segment, although it maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business and will receive ongoing payments in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests. 

Total assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at October 31, 2024, were 4.78 billion, which is 1.47 billion, or 44.6 , above total assets of 3.31 billion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at October 31, 2023.

During the six months ended October 31, 2024, EAM's net income was 2,290,000 after giving effect to Value Line s non-voting revenues interest of 7,726,000, but before distributions to voting profits interest holders and to the Company in respect of its 50 non-voting profits interest. 

The gross fees and net income of EAM s investment management operations during the six months ended October 31, 2023, before interest holder distributions, included total investment management fees earned from the Value Line Funds of 11,068,000, 12b-1 fees and other fees of 3,179,000 and other net gains of 103,000. For the same period, total investment management fee waivers were 162,000 and 12b-1 fee waivers were 48,000. During the six months ended October 31, 2023, EAM's net income was 1,030,000 after giving effect to Value Line s non-voting revenues interest of 5,337,000, but before distributions to voting profits interest holders and to the Company in respect of its 50 non-voting profits interest. 

As of October 31, 2024, one of the Value Line Funds has 12b-1 fees waivers in place, and five funds have partial investment management fee waivers in place. Although, under the terms of the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company does not receive or share in the revenues from 12b-1 distribution fees, the Company could benefit from the fee waivers to the extent that the resulting reduction of expense ratios and enhancement of the performance of the Value Line Funds attracts new assets. 

The Value Line equity and hybrid funds assets represent 99.3 and fixed income fund assets represent 0.7 , respectively, of total fund assets under management AUM as of October 31, 2024. At October 31, 2024, equity and hybrid AUM increased by 45.1 and fixed income AUM remained the same as last year at October 31, 2023.

Salaries and employee benefits 

During the six months ended October 31, 2024, salaries and employee benefits of 7,118,000 decreased 4.3 below the prior fiscal year, primarily due to decreases in salaries and employee benefits resulting from reduced employee headcount during fiscal years 2024 and 2025. 

Production and distribution 

During the six months ended October 31, 2024, production and distribution expenses of 2,938,000 increased 2.2 above prior fiscal year primarily due to increases in third-party distribution and mailing expenses that resulted from outsourcing our internal distribution operations in early May 2024, while ending VLDC activity at April 30, 2024.

Effective income tax rate 

The overall effective income tax rates, as a percentage of pre-tax ordinary income for the six months ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023 were 24.65 and 23.76 , respectively. The higher effective tax rate during six months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to October 31, 2023, is primarily a result of an increase in the state and local income taxes from 3.03 to 3.86 due to changes in state and local income tax allocations. The Company's annualized overall effective tax rate fluctuates due to a number of factors, in addition to changes in tax law, including but not limited to an increase or decrease in the ratio of items that do not have tax consequences to pre-tax income, the Company's geographic profit mix among tax jurisdictions, taxation method adopted by each locality, new interpretations of existing tax laws and rulings and settlements with tax authorities. 

Lease Commitments 

On November 30, 2016, Value Line, Inc., received consent from the landlord at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY to the terms of a new sublease agreement between Value Line, Inc. and ABM Industries, Incorporated ABM or the Sublandlord commencing on December 1, 2016. Pursuant to the agreement Value Line leased from ABM 24,726 square feet of office space located on the second and third floors at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY Building or Premises beginning on December 1, 2016 and ending on November 29, 2027. Base rent under the sublease agreement is 1,126,000 per annum during the first year with an annual increase in base rent of 2.25 scheduled for each subsequent year, payable in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month, subject to customary concessions in the Company s favor and pass-through of certain increases in utility costs and real estate taxes over the base year. The Company provided a security deposit represented by a letter of credit in the amount of 469,000 in October 2016, which was reduced to 305,000 on October 3, 2021 and is to be fully refunded after the sublease ends. This Building became the Company s new corporate office facility. The Company is required to pay for certain operating expenses associated with the Premises as well as utilities supplied to the Premises. Sublandlord provided Value Line a work allowance of 417,000 which accompanied with the six months free rent worth 563,000 was applied against the Company s obligation to pay rent at our NYC headquarters. 

From 2016 to 2024, the Company s subsidiary VLDC and Seagis Property Group LP (the Landlord entered into a lease agreement, pursuant to which VLDC leased 24,110 square feet of warehouse and appurtenant office space located at Lyndhurst, NJ Warehouse ). Base rent under the Lease was 237,218 per annum. The Company provided a security deposit in cash in the amount of 32,146, which has been fully refunded after the Company vacated the premises. VLDC distributed Value Line s print publications from the Warehouse. The Company has outsourced to U.S. contractors the functions formerly performed at the Warehouse. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of 52,961,000 as of October 31, 2024 and 48,770,000 as of April 30, 2024. These amounts include short-term unearned revenue of 15,856,000 and 15,764,000 reflected in total current liabilities at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. Cash and short-term securities were 72,045,000 and 68,345,000 as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. 

The Company s cash and cash equivalents include 10,985,000 and 4,136,000 at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively, invested primarily in commercial banks and in Money Market Funds at brokers, which operate under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act and invest primarily in short-term U.S. government securities. 

Cash from operating activities 

The Company had cash inflows from operating activities of 7,844,000 during the six months ended October 31, 2024, compared to cash inflows of 5,763,000 during the six months ended October 31, 2023. The change in cash inflows was a result of an increase in unrealized gains on equity securities and a decrease in accounts receivable from customers, offset by a smaller decline of unearned revenue from the same period last year. 

31

Cash from investing activities 

The Company had cash inflows from investing activities of 4,889,000 during the six months ended October 31, 2024, compared to cash outflows from investing activities of 3,808,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. The significant cash inflows in investing activities for the six months ended October 31, 2024 was a result of the company s conscious decisions to invest the proceeds from maturities of fixed income short-term securities in the company s short-term U.S. Government money market funds at higher yields than U.S Treasury Bills. 

Cash from financing activities 

During the six months ended October 31, 2024, the Company s cash outflows from financing activities were 5,830,000, compared to cash outflows from financing activities of 5,621,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2023. Quarterly dividend payments of 0.30 per share during fiscal year 2025 aggregated 5,652,000. Quarterly regular dividend payments of 0.28 per share during fiscal year 2024 aggregated 5,283,000. 

At October 31, 2024 there were 9,418,074 common shares outstanding as compared to 9,426,983 common shares outstanding at October 31, 2023. The Company expects financing activities to continue to include use of cash for dividend payments for the foreseeable future. 

Debt and Liquid Assets 

Management believes that the Company s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with future cash flows from operations and from the Company s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond. Management does not anticipate making any borrowings during the next twelve months. As of October 31, 2024, retained earnings and liquid assets were 110,170,000 and 72,045,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2024, retained earnings and liquid assets were 104,249,000 and 68,345,000, respectively. There are no off-balance-sheet arrangements, so none affect the interpretations of reported assets, liquidity, and debt. 

Seasonality 

Our publishing revenues are comprised of subscriptions which are generally annual subscriptions. Our cash flows from operating activities are minimally seasonal in nature, primarily due to the timing of customer payments made for orders and subscription renewals. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ), which requires disclosures of significant expenses by segment and interim disclosure of items that were previously required on an annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is to be applied on a retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

32

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which provides for additional disclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 requires entities to annually disclose the income tax rate reconciliation using both amounts and percentages, considering several categories of reconciling items, including state and local income taxes, foreign tax effects, tax credits and nontaxable or nondeductible items, among others. Disclosure of the reconciling items is subject to a quantitative threshold and disaggregation by nature and jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose net income taxes paid or received to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, as well as by individual jurisdiction, subject to a five percent quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 

The Company prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as in effect in the United States (U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent, and the Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The Company s critical accounting policy relates to the valuation of EAM. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies during the six months ended October 31, 2024. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended April 30, 2024. 

Contractual Obligations 

We are a party to a lease contract which will result in cash payments to a lessor in future periods. Operating lease liabilities are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next four fiscal years and thereafter are (in thousands): 721 in 2025; 1,461 in 2026; 1,493 in 2027 and 882 in 2028 totaling 4,557.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Market Risk Disclosures 

The Company s Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet includes a substantial amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risks. The Company s market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity price risk. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with the Company s investment activities. 

Interest Rate Risk 

The Company s strategy has been to acquire debt securities with low credit risk. Despite this strategy management recognizes and accepts the possibility that losses may occur. To limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes, the Company s management invests primarily in short-term obligations maturing within one year. 

The fair values of the Company s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, and other general market conditions. 

Fixed income securities consist of bank certificates of deposits and securities issued by the United States federal government. As of October 31, 2024 the aggregate cost and fair value of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were 39,008,000 and 38,915,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2024 the aggregate cost and fair value of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were 47,931,000 and 47,611,000, respectively. 

The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks. The hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table.

Management regularly monitors the maturity structure of the Company s investments in debt securities in order to maintain an acceptable price risk associated with changes in interest rates. 

34

Equity Price Risk 

The carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet dates. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold. 

The Company s equity investment strategy has been to acquire equity securities across a diversity of industry groups. The portfolio consists of ETFs held for dividend yield that attempt to replicate the performance of certain equity indexes. In order to maintain liquidity in these securities, the Company s policy has been to invest in and hold in its portfolio, no more than 5 of the approximate average daily trading volume in any one issue. 

As of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, the aggregate cost of the equity securities, which consist of investments in the SPDR Series Trust S P Dividend ETF (SDY), First Trust Value Line Dividend Index ETF (FVD), ProShares Trust S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), IShares DJ Select Dividend ETF (DVY), and other Exchange Traded Funds was a combined total of 15,505,000 and 11,663,000, respectively, and the fair value was 21,837,000 and 16,344,000, respectively.
