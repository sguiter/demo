 Real Estate Properties Held for
Sale 

 On August 26, 2024, the Operating
Partnership, Isosceles JV Investments, LLC, an affiliate of Sixth Street Partners, LLC (the Investor ), and Isosceles JV,
LLC, an affiliate of Sixth Street Partners, LLC (the Joint Venture ), entered into a Limited Liability Company Interest
Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement ), pursuant to which the Operating Partnership will contribute (the Contribution 100 of its equity interests in directly and indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries owning 34 properties located in and around the Chicago
metropolitan statistical area (each, a Chicago Property and, collectively the Chicago Properties to the
Joint Venture, which will be owned 35 by Plymouth Chicago Portfolio, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership,
and 65 by the Investor. The aggregate purchase price for the Chicago Properties is ,
which includes the assumption by the Joint Venture of 
 of debt held by the Company that is currently outstanding with Transamerica Life Insurance Company Transamerica and secured by certain Chicago Properties. An additional 
 of debt held by the Company that is currently outstanding with Midland National Life Insurance Mortgage and secured by a single
Chicago Property is also expected to be paid in full by the Company upon the close of the Contribution (refer to Note 5 
Indebtedness ). The closing of the Contribution is scheduled to take place on the day that is 12 business days following the satisfaction
or waiver of all of the condition s precedent to the closing, including, without limitation, obtaining new financing and refinancing
existing indebtedness secured by the Chicago Properties. The Contribution closing is anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter of 2024,
however it is contingent on the satisfaction of the closing conditions, which cannot be assured. 

As of September 30, 2024, due
to the pending contribution of the Chicago Properties, the carrying amount of the Chicago Properties were classified as "Real estate
assets held for sale, net" and "Real estate liabilities held for sale, net" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Upon classifying
the Chicago Properties as "Real estate assets held for sale, net" and "Real estate liabilities held for sale, net", the Chicago
Properties were recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and the Company ceased recognizing depreciation
on the Chicago Properties. The Company determined that the disposition is not considered discontinued operations as it does not represent
a strategic shift that has or will have a material impact on the Company's operations and financial results.

 During the quarter ended March
31, 2024, the tenant occupying a single-tenant industrial property located in Columbus, Ohio, provided notice of its intention
to exercise its option to purchase the property at a fixed price of 21,480. As a result, we reclassified the respective real estate
property to net investment in sales-type lease totaling

 from Real estate properties, (ii) 
 from Accumulated depreciation, (iii)

 and 
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and

earnings from this lease were recognized in Rental revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Financial Covenant Considerations 

 The Company is in compliance with
all respective financial covenants for its secured and unsecured debt and unsecured revolving line of credit as of September
30, 2024. 

 Fair Value of Debt 

 The fair value of our debt and
borrowings under our revolving line of credit was estimated using Level 3 inputs by calculating the present value of principal
and interest payments, using discount rates that best reflect current market interest rates for financings with similar characteristics
and credit quality, and assuming each loan is outstanding through its maturity.

For derivatives designated and
that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income AOCI and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction
affects earnings. Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made
on the Company s variable-rate debt. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that an additional 10,653 will be reclassified
as a decrease to interest expense. 

Total interest expense presented in the condensed consolidated statements of operations in which the effects of cash flow hedges are recorded	 

Fair Value of Interest Rate Swaps 

 The Company s valuation
of the interest rate swaps is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on
the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to
maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. 

 The Company incorporates credit
valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance
risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the
Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts,
and guarantees. 

 Although the Company has determined
that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments
associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default
by itself and its counterparties. However, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has assessed the significance of
the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit
valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its
derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Non-designated Hedges 

 The Company does not use derivatives
for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. Changes in the fair
value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships would be recorded directly in earnings. 

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 

 The Company has agreements with
each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company either defaults or is capable of being declared in
default on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. Specifically, the
Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated
by the lender due to the Company's default on the indebtedness. 

 As of September 30, 2024, the fair
value of three of the eight interest rate swaps were in a net liability position. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not posted any
collateral related to these agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2024, it could have been
required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value. 

through an at-the-market equity offering program (the 2024 200 Million ATM Program ). The 2024 200
Million ATM Program replaced the previous 200 million ATM program, which was entered into on February 28, 2023 2023 200
Million ATM Program ). 

 For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company did t
issue any shares of its common stock under the 2024 200 Million ATM Program or 2023 200 Million ATM Program. The
Company has approximately available
for issuance under the 2024 200 Million ATM Program.

Redeemable Non-controlling
Interest - Series C Preferred Units 

 On August 26, 2024, 
Non-Convertible
Cumulative Series C Preferred Units Series C Preferred Units ), at a price of 
per
Series C Preferred Unit, for gross proceeds of 60,910, net of 7,280 in Investor fees to be paid in four equal installments at
closing and each anniversary over the next three years and 4,068 issuance costs, to the Investor pursuant to the Securities Purchase
Agreement Purchase Agreement ). Bundled with the issuance of 
Series
C Preferred Units, the Company, through its Operating Partnership, also issued (i) a forward contract, pursuant to which the Operating
Partnership will sell an additional 
Series
C Preferred Units at a price of 
per
Series C Preferred Unit within 270 days upon execution of the Purchase Agreement, and (ii) warrants that are exercisable into 11,760,000
of OP Units Warrants ). 

 The Company has classified the
Series C Preferred Units as redeemable non-controlling interests within the mezzanine equity section of the condensed consolidated balance
sheets as it includes a redemption feature outside the control of the Company. The forward contract asset requires the issuance of additional
shares of Series C Preferred Units, is therefore indexed to a contingent obligation to redeem our own stock and settle in cash, and therefore
is required to be classified as an asset (or liability as the case may be) and recorded at fair value with changes in value recognized
in earnings. As discussed in Note 11, the Warrants are liability-classified with an initial fair value at issuance of 89,856,
with subsequent changes in its fair value recognized in earnings. The net proceeds at issuance were first attributed to the Warrants
and the forward contract asset, resulting in the Company recording a loss on issuance of 
 and initially recording the Series C Preferred Units for a nominal amount of 0.01. Issuance costs are expensed as incurred and
included within the Loss on financing transaction. 

 While the Series C Preferred Units can be redeemed contingent
upon the occurrence of a person or group becoming the owner of 50 or more of the total voting power of all shares of the Company s
capital stock, the consummation of a consolidation, merger or similar transaction involving the Operating Partnership or the Company,
or if the Company s common stock (the Common Stock is delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, or cease
to be traded in contemplation of a delisting of such shares of Common Stock (simply, upon a Fundamental Change ), the occurrence
of a Fundamental Change is not within the control of the Company. The Company determined that the occurrence of a Fundamental Change
is not probable; as a result, the carrying amount of the Series C Preferred Units will not be required to be accreted to redemption value
until the Series C Preferred Units either become currently redeemable or probable of becoming redeemable. 

The relevant features of the Series
C Preferred Units are as follows: 

 Liquidation Rights 

 In the event the Operating
Partnership voluntarily or involuntarily liquidates, dissolves or winds up, the holders of Series C Preferred Units at the time will
be entitled to receive liquidating distributions in an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference. The Liquidation Preference
is calculated as the greater of: (i) the 1,000 stated value of the Series C Preferred Units plus accrued and unpaid distributions
on the Series C Preferred Units through the applicable liquidation date, or (ii) an amount of cash for each Series C Preferred Unit equal
to 1,350 less the aggregate amount of Cash Distributions (as defined below) actually paid in respect of each Series C Preferred
Unit after the issue date and through the applicable liquidation date. 

 The liquidating distributions
will be paid out of assets legally available for distribution and before any distribution of assets are made to holders of any other
junior securities of the Operating Partnership. 

 Redemption Rights 

 The Operating Partnership shall
have the right, at its option, to redeem the Series C Preferred Units, in whole or in part, at any time in a cash amount equal to the
liquidation preference in effect at the time of such redemption. 

 If the Operating Partnership or
the Company executes an agreement whose performance would constitute a Fundamental Change, then the Operating Partnership shall be required
to redeem the Series C Preferred Units, in whole, on the applicable redemption date at a price equal to the Liquidation Preference,
to the extent the Operating Partnership has funds legally available to do so. 

 Voting Rights 

 Holders of the Series C Preferred
Units will not be entitled to vote on any matter or to participate in any meeting of partners. 

Dividend Rights 

 Holders are entitled to
receive, on a cumulative basis, (i) distributions in the form of fully paid Series C Preferred Units known as PIK Distributions 
which will be payable at the PIK Distribution Rate and (ii) distributions in the form of cash known as Cash Distributions 
which will be payable at the Cash Distribution Rate. The PIK Distributions and Cash Distributions will be payable quarterly
in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. 

The PIK Distribution Rate is
a rate per annum equal to (a) within the first 5 years after the Original Issue Date, 7.0 less the applicable Cash Distribution Rate,
(b) in the 6th and 7th years after the Original Issue Date, the greater of: (i) 12.0 or (ii) SOFR plus 650 basis points less the applicable
Cash Distribution Rate, and (c) from the 8th year after the Original Issue Date and each subsequent year thereafter, the greater of (i)
16.0 or (ii) SOFR plus 1,050 basis points, less the applicable Cash Distribution Rate. 

 Distributions on each Series C
Preferred Unit will accrue on the 1,000 stated value of each Series C Preferred Unit as well as on all unpaid distributions that have
accrued and accumulated for all prior distribution periods. Unpaid distributions incurred as of the end of the quarter are accreted and
accumulated with prior unpaid distributions within redeemable non-controlling interest Series C Preferred Units on our condensed
consolidated balance sheets and as an adjustment to net income (loss) within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Any
cash distributions paid are recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the redeemable non-controlling interest 
Series C Preferred Units. As of September 30, 2024, the 426 reflected within redeemable non-controlling interest Series C Preferred
Units represents the cash and PIK dividends accrued during the third quarter of 2024.

Fair Market Value of Forward Contract Asset 

 The forward contract asset represents
the fair market value of the Company s obligation to sell the additional 79,090 Series C Preferred Units within 270 days upon the
execution of the Purchase Agreement. The fair value of the forward contract asset is re-measured at each financial reporting period

requisite period of the award. The unrecognized compensation expense associated with the Company s restricted shares of common stock
at September 30, 2024 was approximately and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years.
The fair value of the restricted shares granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately with
a weighted average fair value of per share. 

Performance Stock Units 

 On April 15, 2024, the compensation
committee of the board of directors approved, and the Company granted, Performance Stock Units PSUs under the 2014
Incentive Award Plan to certain executive officers and key employees of the Company. The PSUs are subject to performance-based criteria
including the Company s total shareholder return (35 and total shareholder return compared to the MSCI US REIT Index (65 over
a three-year performance period. Upon conclusion of the performance period, the final number of PSUs vested will range between zero to
a maximum of 171,966 PSUs. All vested performance stock units will convert into shares of common stock on a 1-to-1 basis. Equity-based
compensation expense is charged to earnings ratably from the grant date through to the end of the performance period. 

 The fair value of the PSUs of 
was determined using a lattice-binomial option-pricing model based on a Monte Carlo simulation applying Level 3 inputs as described in
Note 2. The significant inputs into the model were: grant date of April 15, 2024, volatility of , an expected annual dividend of

 During the three months September 30, 2023, there were
 approximately 156 unvested restricted shares of common stock on a weighted average basis that were not included in the computation
 of diluted earnings per share as including these shares would be anti-dilutive. During the three and nine months ended September
 30, 2024 and nine months ended September 30, 2023, all unvested restricted shares of common stock were deemed to be anti-dilutive
 due to the net loss attributable to common stockholders. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, all warrants
 were out of the money and were also excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as they were deemed
 to be anti-dilutive. 
 
 (1) 

The Company uses the two-class
method of computing earnings per common share in which participating securities are included within the basic earnings per share EPS calculation. The amount allocated to participating securities is according to dividends declared (whether paid or unpaid). The restricted
stock does not have any participatory rights in undistributed earnings. The unvested shares of restricted stock are accounted for as participating
securities as they contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends. PSUs, which are subject to vesting based on the Company achieving certain
total shareholder return thresholds over a three-year performance period, are included as contingently issuable shares in the calculation
of diluted EPS when the total shareholder return thresholds are achieved at or above the threshold levels specific in the award agreements,
assuming the reporting period is the end of the performance period, and the effect is dilutive. 

 In periods where there is a
net loss attributable to common stockholders, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and
diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same. The Company's potential dilutive securities for the three
months ended September 30, 2023 include the 
 shares of restricted common stock and 
 PSUs. The restricted common shares, PSUs and out of the money warrants have been excluded from the computation of diluted net
loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and nine months ended September
30, 2023 as the effect of including them would reduce the net loss per share.

OP Units with an initial strike price of per unit; 

The
 second tranche is for OP Units with an initial strike price of per unit; and, 

The
 third tranche is for OP Units with an initial strike price of per unit. 
 
 Once the holder of such Warrants
exercises the Warrants into OP Units, the holder can elect to tender for redemption the OP Units in exchange for cash,
however the Company can elect to settle these OP Units for either cash or shares of the Company s Common Stock at the election
of the Company pursuant to the exchange right set forth in the Warrant Agreement. The Warrants are exercisable on a net settlement basis
and expire on August 26, 2029, subject to a two-year extension under certain conditions. 

 The Warrants provide standard
antidilution adjustments, as well as adjustments in the strike price of the Warrants to an amount equal to the issuance price per share,
of the Common Stock or OP Unit, if the Company or the Operating Partnership issues (or otherwise sells) any shares of Common Stock,
OP Units, or equity-linked securities, if Company or the Operating Partnership reprices or amends any of its any
existing equity-linked securities and upon the payment of dividends. This provision does not meet the definition of a down round
feature as it is not solely related to an issuance of equity securities. Therefore, the Warrants are not considered indexed to
the Operating Partnership s own stock and required to be accounted for as derivative liabilities, initially recognized at
fair value, and subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. 

 In accordance with the adjustment
provisions outlined within the Warrant Agreement, the associated strike price and amount of each tranche of Warrants were adjusted to
the following at September 30, 2024: 

The
 first tranche is for 
 OP Units with an initial strike price of 
 per unit, 

The
 second tranche is for 
 OP Units with an initial strike price of 
 per unit, and 

The
 third tranche is for 
 OP Units with an initial strike price of 
 per unit. 
 
 Redemption 

 The Operating Partnership has
the right to redeem all outstanding Warrants for cash if the volume-weighted average price of the Common Stock for the 90 consecutive
trading days ending on the 5 th anniversary of the Original Issue Date Redemption VWAP is less than
 21.00. This redemption right may only be exercised once and, if exercised, must be exercised in redemption of all outstanding Warrants
at such time. The Operating Partnership does not have the right to redeem the Warrants at its election. 

 In the event of a redemption,
if the Operating Partnership does not pay the applicable redemption price, calculated in accordance with the Warrant Agreement,
prior to the close of business on the redemption date, then any amounts paid after the redemption date shall accrue
interest at a rate of 10.0 per annum, compounding monthly. 

Exercise of Warrants 

 Holders of the Warrants will have
the right to submit all, or any whole number of Warrants that is less than all of their Warrants for exercise at any time during
the first 5 years after the date of issuance of the Warrants. This can be extended to 7 years if the volume-weighted average price of
the Common Stock for the 90 consecutive trading days ending on the 5 th anniversary of the issuance date is equal to or less
than the strike price of the Warrants. 

 Settlement Upon Exercise 

 Upon the exercise of any Warrant, the Operating
Partnership will settle such exercise by paying or delivering OP Units according to either a physical or cashless settlement. 

The exercise price of the Warrants is subject to
adjustment upon the occurrence of: 

Stock
 dividends, splits or combinations, 

The
 distribution of rights, options or warrants of the Company s Common Stock 

Distributions
 of shares of capital stock or other property 

Cash
 dividends and distributions 

Tender
 or exchange offers made by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for shares of Common Stock 

Degressive
 Issuances 

Exchange Right 

 Each holder of the Warrants who
exercises their Warrants to obtain OP Units will have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a
portion of the OP Units held by the holder. The settlement amount subject to the redemption right is a cash amount equal to: 

The
 last reported sale price per share of Common Stock on the trading day immediately prior to the date that the redemption is
 exercised, multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of OP Units offered for redemption
 by the holder, multiplied by the Conversion Factor. 

The
 Conversion Factor is 1.0 but is subject to adjustment if the Company declares or pays a dividend on its Common Stock or makes a distribution
 to all holders of its Common Stock in shares of outstanding Common Stock, subdivides its Common Stock or combines its outstanding
 Common Stock. The Conversion Factor will also be adjusted if the Company enters into a merger, acquisition, combination or consolidation
 where the Company is no longer the general partner of the Operating Partnership. 
 
 If a holder exercises their redemption
right, the Company will have the sole and absolute discretion to elect to redeem the OP Units by paying to the holder either
the settlement amount or an amount in the Company s Common Stock. 

 Fair Market Value of Warrants 

 The fair value of the Warrants
is re-measured at each financial reporting period with any changes in fair value recognized as an unrealized loss/gain of Warrants in
the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations, included within Loss on financing transaction. The Warrants
are not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share as they are anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

square foot property located in Atlanta, GA at the greater of the property s then-current fair market value, or, 150 of aggregate
capital contributions made by the majority partner. Such right can be executed by the majority partner no sooner than June 1, 2025, and
no later than August 29, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the projected fair market value of the property at the date the put option is
exercisable is expected to exceed the 150 of the aggregate capital contributions made by the majority partner, and as such, there is
no contingent liability to recognize.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

 We make statements in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q that are forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as anticipates, 
 believes, estimates, expects, intends, may, plans, 
 projects, seeks, should, will, and variations of such words or similar expressions.
Our forward-looking statements reflect our current views about our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects, which are
based on the information currently available to us and on assumptions we have made. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, expectations,
strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that
our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies or prospects will be attained or achieved and you should not place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements. Additionally, unforeseen factors emerge from time to time, and we cannot predict which factors will arise
or their ultimate impact on our business or the extent to which any such factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, actual results may differ materially from those
described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and factors including, without limitation: 

the general level of interest rates; 

financing risks, including the risks that our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest and we may be unable to refinance our existing debt upon maturity or obtain new financing on attractive terms or at all; 

the uncertainty and economic impact of pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies or fear of such events, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, including, without limitation, its impact on the Company s ability to pay common stock dividends and/or the amount and frequency of the dividends; 

the competitive environment in which we operate; 

real estate risks, including fluctuations in real estate values and the general economic climate in local markets and competition for tenants in such markets; 

decreased rental rates or increasing vacancy rates; 

potential defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants; 

potential bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants; 

acquisition risks, including failure of such acquisitions to perform in accordance with projections; 

the timing of acquisitions and dispositions; 

potential natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires or floods; 

national, international, regional and local economic conditions; 

potential changes in the law or governmental regulations that affect us and interpretations of those laws and regulations, including changes in real estate and zoning or REIT tax laws, and potential increases in real property tax rates; 

lack of or insufficient amounts of insurance; 

our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT; 

litigation, including costs associated with prosecuting or defending claims and any adverse outcomes; and 

possible environmental liabilities, including costs, fines or penalties that may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of properties presently owned or previously owned by us. 
 
 Any forward-looking statement speaks
only as of the date on which it is made. New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events
or how they may affect us. Except as required by law, we are not obligated to, and do not intend to, update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

 The following discussion and analysis
is based on, and should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and notes thereto for the periods ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, as well as information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on February 22, 2024, including the audited historical financial statements and related notes thereto as of and for the years ended December
31, 2023 and 2022 contained therein, which is accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. 

 Overview 

 We
are a full service, vertically integrated real estate investment company focused on the acquisition, ownership, and management of single
and multi-tenant industrial properties, including distribution centers, warehouses, light industrial and small bay industrial properties,
located in primary and secondary markets within the main industrial, distribution and logistics corridors of the United States. Our mission
is to provide tenants with cost effective space that is functional, flexible and safe. 

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company,
through its subsidiaries, owned 158 industrial properties comprising 223 buildings with an aggregate of approximately 34.9 million square
feet, and our property management office building located in Columbus, Ohio, totaling approximately 17,260 square feet. 

27 

We are also evaluating diversifying
our portfolio of real estate assets to include the origination or acquisition of mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans, all of which would
be collateralized by properties that meet investment criteria that are substantially the same as our real estate portfolio or that are
complementary to our existing assets. The Company believes expanding its investment strategy to include these types of real estate-related
assets will enable it to deploy its capital efficiently to continue to grow at times when acquisitions of industrial properties are limited
due either to availability or cost. 

 We seek to generate attractive
risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through a combination of dividends and capital appreciation. 

 Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations 

 Business and Strategy 

 Our core investment strategy is
to acquire industrial properties located in primary and secondary markets across the U.S, as well as select sub-markets across the U.S.
We expect to acquire these properties through third-party purchases and structured sale-leasebacks where we believe we can achieve attractive
initial yields and strong ongoing cash-on-cash returns. 

 Our target markets are located
in primary and secondary markets, as well as select sub-markets, because we believe these markets tend to have less occupancy and rental
rate volatility and less buyer competition relative to gateway markets. We also believe that the systematic aggregation of such properties
will result in a diversified portfolio that will produce sustainable risk-adjusted returns. Future results of operations may be affected,
either positively or negatively, by our ability to effectively execute this strategy. 

 We also intend to continue pursuing
joint venture arrangements with institutional partners which could provide management fee income, a residual profit-sharing income and
the ability to purchase properties out of the joint venture over time. Such joint ventures may involve investing in industrial assets
that would be characterized as opportunistic or value-add investments. These may involve development or redevelopment strategies that
may require significant up-front capital expenditures, lengthy lease-up periods and result in inconsistent cash flows. As such, these
properties risk profiles and return metrics would likely differ from the non-joint venture properties that we target for acquisition. 

 Rental Revenue and Tenant Recoveries 

 We receive income primarily from
rental revenue from our properties. The amount of rental revenue generated by the Company s portfolio depends principally on the
occupancy levels and lease rates at our properties, our ability to lease currently available space and space that becomes available as
a result of lease expirations and on the rental rates at our properties. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s portfolio was approximately
94.2 occupied. Our occupancy rate is impacted by general market conditions in the geographic areas which our properties are located and
the financial condition of tenants in our target markets. 

 Scheduled Lease Expirations Leasing Activity 

 Our ability to re-lease space
subject to expiring leases will impact our results of operations and will be affected by economic and competitive conditions in the markets
in which we operate and by the desirability of our individual properties. During the period from October 1, 2024 through to December
31, 2026, an aggregate of 37.0 of the annualized base rent leases in the Company s portfolio are scheduled to expire, which we
believe will provide us an opportunity to increase rents under below market leases to then-current rental rates. 

 The table below reflects certain
data about our new and renewed leases with terms of greater than six months executed and commenced during the nine months ended September
30, 2024.

 Conditions in Our Markets 

 The Company s portfolio is
located in various primary and secondary markets within the main industrial distribution and logistics corridors of the United States.
Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in these markets are likely
to affect our overall performance. 

 Property Expenses 

 Our rental expenses generally consist
of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and repair and maintenance costs. For the majority of the Company s portfolio, property
expenses are controlled, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross lease expense reimbursement provisions in tenant
leases. However, the terms of our tenant leases vary and in some instances the leases may provide that we are responsible for certain
property expenses. Accordingly, our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property
expenses to our tenants.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

 Our critical accounting estimates
are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical
Accounting Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates other than as noted below. 

 Warrant Liability 

 The fair value of Warrant liability
is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of warrant
requires considerable judgment. Any change in the estimates used may cause the value to be higher or lower than that reported. The estimated
volatility of our warrant liability at the date of issuance, and at each subsequent reporting period, is based on our historical volatility.
The risk-free interest rate is based on rates published by the government for bonds with maturity similar to the expected remaining life
of the warrant liability at the valuation date. The expected life of the warrant liability is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining
contractual term. 

 The Warrant liability is not
traded in an active market and the fair value is determined using valuation techniques. The estimates may be significantly different
from those recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements because of the use of judgment and the inherent uncertainty in
estimating the fair value of these instruments that are not quoted in an active market. All changes in the fair value are recorded in
the condensed consolidated statement of operations each reporting period. 

 For additional information
regarding the valuation of the Warrant liability, see Note 11. 

 Critical Accounting Policies 

 Our financial statements are prepared
in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Management makes significant estimates regarding the allocation of tangible and intangible assets or business acquisitions,
impairments of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation, preferred unit forward contract asset and its warrant liability. These
estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions
on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. Management adjusts such
estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results
could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 

 Our critical accounting policies
are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical
Accounting Policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024, and the notes to the financial
statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, we believe the policies set forth in our 2023
10-K are critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations. If actual results or events differ
materially from the estimates, judgments and assumptions used by us in applying these policies, our reported financial condition and
results of operations could be materially affected. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to
our critical accounting policies other than outlined as follows. 

 Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest 
Preferred Units 

 The Company applies the guidance
enumerated in ASC 480, when determining the classification and measurement of preferred units. Preferred units subject to mandatory redemption,
if any, is classified as a liability and is measured at fair value. The Company classifies conditionally redeemable preferred units,
which includes preferred units that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to
redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control, as mezzanine equity. The
Company subsequently measures mezzanine equity based on whether the instrument is currently redeemable or whether or not it is probable
the instrument will become redeemable. Upon determination that the instrument is probable of redemption, the Company will adjust the
carrying value to the redemption value. If redemption is not probable, the Company will not adjust the carrying value of the instrument
recorded as mezzanine equity other than to reflect dividends accrued and not yet paid, but which will be payable under the redemption
feature. 

 Warrants 

 The Company accounts for warrants
as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement. Warrants that
are not considered indexed to the Company s own stock are required to be accounted for as a liability. Liability-classified
financial instruments are measured at fair value on the issuance date and at the end of each reporting period. Any change in the fair
value of the financial instrument after the issuance date is recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements through
earnings.

Results of Operations (dollars in thousands) 

 Our condensed consolidated results
of operations are often not comparable from period to period due to the effect of property acquisitions and dispositions completed during
the comparative reporting periods. Our Total Portfolio represents all of the properties owned during the reported periods. To eliminate
the effect of changes in our Total Portfolio due to acquisitions, dispositions and other, and to highlight the operating results of our
on-going business, we have separately presented the results of our Same Store Portfolio and Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other. 

 For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, we define the Same Store Portfolio as a subset of our Total Portfolio and includes properties that were wholly
owned by us for the entire period presented. We define Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other as any properties that were acquired, sold,
placed into service or held for development or repositioning during the period from January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024.

increased by 1,696 to 51,432 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 49,736 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. This was primarily related to a net increase of 787 within the Same Store Portfolio primarily due to an increase in rent income
of 670 due to leasing activities, an increase of 670 in tenant recoveries, partially offset by a decrease in
non-cash rent adjustments of 553 and a net increase of 909 within Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other primarily within acquisitions,
dispositions and other primarily due to an increase in rental revenue from acquisitions. 

 Property expenses: Property
expenses increased 1,620 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 17,374 as compared to 15,754 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to property expenses for the Same Store Portfolio increasing approximately 1,235 driven primarily
by an increase of 1,568 in operating expenses, increase in real estate taxes of 291, partially offset by a decrease in utilities
of 624, and an increase of 385 within Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other related to acquisitions. 

 Depreciation and amortization:
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 1,871 to 21,010 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to 22,881 for the three months ended September 30 2023, primarily due to a net decrease of 2,332 for the Same Store Portfolio due to
full depreciation and amortization of certain assets and real estate properties held for sale no longer being depreciated and amortized
as of August 26, 2024, offset by an increase of 461 within Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other. 

 General and administrative :
General and administrative expenses increased approximately 285 to 3,582 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to 3,297 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is attributable primarily to an increase in professional fees of
 195.

 Supplemental Earnings Measures (dollars in thousands) 

 Investors in and industry analysts
following the real estate industry utilize supplemental earnings measures such as net operating income NOI ), earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate EBITDA re ), funds from operations FFO ),
core funds from operations Core FFO and adjusted funds from operations AFFO as supplemental operating
performance measures of an equity REIT. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably
over time through depreciation. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry
analysts and investors prefer to supplement operating results that use historical cost accounting with measures such as NOI, EBITDA re ,
FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, among others. We provide information related to NOI, EBITDA re , FFO, Core FFO and AFFO both because such
industry analysts are interested in such information, and because our management believes NOI, EBITDA re , FFO, Core FFO and AFFO
are important performance measures. NOI, EBITDA re , FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are factors used by management in measuring our performance.
Neither NOI, EBITDA re , FFO, Core FFO or AFFO should be considered as a substitute for net income, or any other measures derived
in accordance with GAAP. Neither NOI, EBITDA re , FFO, Core FFO or AFFO represents cash generated from operating activities in accordance
with GAAP and neither should be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, nor
is either indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. 

 NOI 

 We consider net operating income,
or NOI, to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income in that it helps both investors and management understand the core operations
of our properties. We define NOI as total revenue (including rental revenue and tenant recoveries) less property-level operating expenses.
NOI excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, gain/loss on sale of real estate, interest
expense, loss on financing transaction, and other non-operating items.

Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). EBITDA re represents net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, before
interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on the sale of rental property, appreciation (depreciation) of warrants,
loss on impairments, loss on financing transaction, and loss on extinguishment of debt. We believe that EBITDA re is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure
of our operating performance as a real estate company as it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our industrial properties.

FFO 

 Funds from operations, or FFO,
is a non-GAAP financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of a REIT s operating performance, thereby, providing investors
the potential to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure
of our operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such
as depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and
improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values rise and fall
with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative.
In December 2018, NAREIT issued a white paper restating the definition of FFO. The purpose of the restatement was not to change the fundamental
definition of FFO, but to clarify existing NAREIT guidance. The restated definition of FFO is as follows: Net Income (Loss) (calculated
in accordance with GAAP), excluding: (i) Depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) Gains and losses from the sale of
certain real estate assets, (iii) Gain and losses from change in control, and (iv) Impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets
and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by
the entity. We define FFO, consistent with the NAREIT definition. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will
be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Other equity REITs may not calculate FFO as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be
comparable to such other REITs FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity and is not indicative of funds available
for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. 

33 

We calculate Core FFO by adjusting
FFO for items such as dividends paid or accrued to holders of our preferred stock and redeemable non-controlling interest, acquisition
and transaction related expenses for transactions not completed, loss on financing transaction, and certain non-cash operating expenses
such as impairment on real estate lease, unrealized loss/(gain) on financing instruments, and loss on extinguishment of debt. We believe
that Core FFO is a useful supplemental measure in addition to FFO by adjusting for items that are not considered by us to be part of
the period-over-period operating performance of our property portfolio, thereby, providing a more meaningful and consistent comparison
of our operating and financial performance during the periods presented below. As with FFO, our reported Core FFO may not be comparable
to other REITs Core FFO, should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash
needs, including our ability to pay dividends. 

The following table sets forth a
reconciliation of our historical net income (loss) FFO and Core FFO for the periods presented:

AFFO 

 Adjusted funds from operations,
or AFFO, is presented in addition to Core FFO. AFFO is defined as Core FFO, excluding certain non-cash operating revenues and expenses,
capitalized interest and recurring capitalized expenditures. Recurring capitalized expenditures include expenditures required to maintain
and re-tenant our properties, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. AFFO further adjusts Core FFO for certain other non-cash items,
including the amortization or accretion of above or below market rents included in revenues, straight line rent adjustments, non-cash
equity compensation and non-cash interest expense. 

 We believe AFFO provides a useful
supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time
periods that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management s analysis of the operating
performance of our properties. As a result, we believe that the use of AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a
more complete understanding of our operating performance. 

 As with Core FFO, our reported
AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs AFFO, should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds
available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.

Cash Flow (dollars in thousands) 

 A summary of our cash flows for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows: 

Nine Months Ended September 30,

 (8,311 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities	 
 41,508 
 (55,889 

Operating activities : Net
cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 9,214 compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in other assets and decreases in accounts payable,
accrued expenses and other liabilities for operating expenses due to timing of cash payments and increases in interest expense. 

 Investing activities: Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately 79,890 compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in acquisitions of real estate properties of 101,387, a decrease in
proceeds from the sale of real estate of 9,792, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of 10,045 and an increase
in proceeds from net investment in sales-type lease of 21,244 

 Financing activities: Net
cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 97,397 compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The change was predominantly driven by an increase in net proceeds from financing transaction of 56,733, a decrease in cash
used for the repurchase and redemption of Series A Preferred Stock of 48,867, increase in net proceeds from the line of credit facility
 42,486, partially offset by an increase in debt issuance costs and dividends and distributions paid of 672, a decrease of 50,016 in
proceeds from common stock, and an increase in debt issuance costs of 1. 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 We intend to make reserve contributions
as necessary to aid our objective of preserving capital for our investors by supporting the maintenance and viability of properties we
acquire in the future. If reserves and any other available income become insufficient to cover our operating expenses and liabilities,
it may be necessary to obtain additional funds by borrowing, refinancing properties or liquidating our investments. 

 Our short-term liquidity requirements
consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties, including: 

property expenses that are not borne by our tenants under our leases; 

principal and interest expense on outstanding indebtedness; 

general and administrative expenses; and 

capital expenditures for tenant improvements and leasing commissions. 
 
 We intend to satisfy our short-term
liquidity requirements through our existing cash, cash flow from operating activities and the net proceeds of any potential future offerings. 

 Our long-term liquidity needs consist
primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities.
We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, future
issuances of equity and debt securities, property dispositions and joint venture transactions, and, in connection with acquisitions of
additional properties, the issuance of OP units. 

 As of September 30, 2024, we had
available liquidity of approximately 179.8 million, comprised of 26.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and 153.6 million of borrowing
capacity on our KeyBank unsecured line of credit. The Company anticipates it will have sufficient liquidity and access to capital resources
to meet its current obligations and to meet any scheduled debt maturities.

 For the month of September 2024, the one-month term SOFR for our unsecured debt was 5.195 and the one-month term SOFR for our borrowings under line of credit was at a weighted average of 4.980 . The spread over the applicable rate for the 100m, 150m, and 200m KeyBank Term Loans and KeyBank unsecured line of credit is based on the Company s total leverage ratio plus the 0.1 SOFR index adjustment. 
 
 (2) 
 The one-month term SOFR for the 100m, 150m and 200m KeyBank Term Loans was swapped to a fixed rate of 1.504 , 2.904 , and 1.527 , respectively. 
 
 (3) 
 100 million of the outstanding borrowings under the KeyBank unsecured line of credit was swapped to a fixed USD-SOFR rate at a weighted average of 4.754 . 
 
 (4) 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Midland National Life Insurance Mortgage and the Transamerica Loan were reclassified to Real estate liabilities held for sale, net on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The KeyBank unsecured line of credit
contains certain financial covenants including limitations on total leverage, unsecured interest coverage and fixed charge coverage charges
ratios. Our access to borrowings may be limited if we fail to meet any of these covenants. We are in compliance with our financial covenants
as of September 30, 2024, and we anticipate that we will be able to operate in compliance with our financial covenants for the next twelve
months. 

 Stock Issuances (dollars in thousands) 

 Universal Shelf S-3 Registration Statement 

 On February 27, 2024, the Company
and Operating Partnership filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 2024 750 Million S-3 Filing with
the SEC registering an aggregate of 750,000 of securities, consisting of an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock, depository
shares, warrants, rights to purchase our common stock and debt securities. 

 As September 30, 2024, the Company
has 750,000 available for issuance under the 2024 750 Million S-3 Filing. 

 ATM Program 

 On February 27, 2024, the Company
and the Operating Partnership entered into a distribution agreement with certain sales agents, forward sellers and forward
purchasers, as applicable, pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of its Common Stock
with aggregate gross proceeds not to exceed 200,000 through an at-the-market equity offering program (the 2024
 200 Million ATM Program ). The 2024 200 Million ATM Program replaced the previous 200 million ATM program, which was entered
into on February 28, 2023 2023 200 Million ATM Program ). 

 For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company did not issue any shares of its Common Stock under the 2024 200 Million ATM Program or 2023
 200 Million ATM Program. The Company has approximately 200,000 available for issuance under the 2024 200 Million ATM Program. 

36 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

 As of September 30, 2024, we have no off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

 Inflation 

 Prior to 2021, the rate of inflation
was low and had minimal impact on the performance of our industrial properties in the markets in which we operate, however, inflation
has significantly increased in recent periods and may remain at an elevated level or increase further. The majority of our leases are
either triple net or provide for tenant recoveries for costs related to real estate taxes and operating expenses. In addition, most of
the leases provide for fixed rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual
rent increases and tenant payment of taxes and expenses described above. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on
our historical financial position or results of operations. 

 Interest Rate Risk (dollars in thousands) 

 The Company uses interest rate
swap agreements as a derivative instrument to manage interest rate risk and is recognized on the condensed consolidated balance sheets
at fair value. As of September 30, 2024, all our outstanding variable rate debt was fixed with interest rate swaps through maturity with
the exception of the balance of 96,400 under the KeyBank unsecured line of credit. We recognize all derivatives within the condensed
consolidated balance sheets at fair value. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value
of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings
or recognized in other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders equity. The ineffective portion of a derivative s
change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had entered into eight interest rate
swap agreements.

_______________ 

(1) 
 Represents the notional value of interest rate swaps effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 (2) 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of five of the interest rate swaps were in an asset position of approximately 13.2 million and the remaining three interest rate swaps were in a liability position of approximately 1.1 million. 
 
 Although the Company has determined
that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments
associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default
by itself and its counterparties. However, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit
valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are
not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in
their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

 During the next twelve months,
the Company estimates that an additional 10,653 will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense. No assurance can be given that
any future hedging activities by us will have the desired beneficial effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 

 At September 30, 2024, we
had 646,400 of outstanding variable rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, all our outstanding variable debt was fixed with interest rate
swaps through maturity, with the exception of the KeyBank unsecured line of credit which had only 100,000 of its 196,400 balance fixed
with interest rate swaps through maturity. The KeyBank unsecured line of credit was subject to a weighted average interest rate of 6.85 
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Based on the variable rate borrowings for our KeyBank unsecured line of credit outstanding
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we estimate that had the average interest rate on our weighted average borrowings increased
by 25 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our interest expense for the quarter would have increased by approximately
 76. This estimate assumes the interest rate of each borrowing is raised by 25 basis points. The impact on future interest expense as
a result of future changes in interest rates will depend largely on the gross amount of our borrowings at that time. 

 For fixed rate debt, changes in
interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt, but not our earnings or cash flows. The interest rate risk and changes in
fair market value of fixed rate debt generally do not have a significant impact on us until we are required to refinance such debt. See
Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the maturity dates of our various fixed rate debt. 

37 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK (amounts in thousands) 

 Our future income, cash flows and
fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss
from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. The primary market risk we are exposed to is interest rate risk. We have used
derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to some of our borrowings, primarily through interest
rate swaps. For additional detail, refer to Interest Rate Risk section within Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 Our management has evaluated, under
supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

 There have been no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or were reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

38 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 

 The nature of our business exposes
our properties, us and our Operating Partnership to the risk of claims and litigation in the normal course of business. Other than routine
litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business, we are not presently subject to any material litigation nor, to our knowledge,
is any material litigation threatened against us. 

 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 

 There have been no material changes
to the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 22,
2024, with the exception of the risk factors set forth below, which update and supplement the risk factors disclosed therein.
For a full description of these risk factors, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2023. 

 The rights of the holders of our
Common Stock are limited by and subordinate to the rights of the holders of the Operating Partnership s Series C Preferred Units
and these rights may have a negative effect on the value of shares of our Common Stock. 

 The holders of
shares of the Operating Partnership s Series C Preferred Units have rights and preferences generally senior to those of the holders
of our Common Stock. The existence of these senior rights and preferences may have a negative impact on the value of shares of our Common
Stock. These rights are more fully set forth in the certificate of designation governing our Series C Preferred Units and include but
are not limited to: (i) dividend and distribution rights, (ii) rights on liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Operating Partnership
or the Company, as applicable and (iii) redemption rights upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change (as defined in the certificate of
designations). 

 We have issued and may continue
to issue Series C Preferred Units that rank senior to our Common Stock in priority of dividend payment and upon liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Operating Partnership or the Company and redemption rights upon the occurrence of Fundamental Change, and have additional
corporate governance rights that may materially adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Common Stock and the trading
price of our Common Stock. 

 On August 26, 2024, we issued
60,910 Series C Preferred Units to the Investor, and we will be required to issue an additional 79,090 Series C Preferred
Units to the Investor in one or more additional closings to occur on or before May 23, 2025. The holders of the Series C Preferred
Units are entitled to a quarterly distribution payable in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year in both
cash and additional Series C Preferred Units. The Series C Preferred Units rank senior to our Common Stock with respect to priority
of such dividend payments, as well as to rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Operating Partnership and the Company
and redemption rights upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change. As a result, distributions on the Series C Preferred Units may
limit our ability to make distributions to holders of our Common Stock. Further, upon our Operating Partnership s liquidation,
holders of our Series C Preferred Units will receive a distribution of our Operating Partnership s available assets before
common stockholders in an amount of cash equal to the greater of (i) 1,000 per Series C Preferred Unit, subject to certain adjustments
for, among other things, OP unit splits and the payment of dividends, including regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock,
plus all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to or (ii) an amount of cash equal to 1,350 less the aggregate amount of Cash Distributions
actually paid in respect of such share after the date of issuance and through but not including the applicable liquidation date, redemption
date or other applicable measurement date. Holders of shares of our Common Stock bear the risk that our future issuances of equity securities,
including additional Series C Preferred Units as quarterly dividend payments to the holders of our Series C Preferred Units, will dilute
the ownership interest of existing holders of our Common Stock, and may negatively affect our results of operations and the trading price
of our Common Stock. 

 In addition, so long as any Series
C Preferred Units are outstanding, the consent of a majority of the holders of the Series C Preferred Units, voting as a single class,
is required for us to take certain actions which include, but are not limited to: (i) amend our charter or our Operating Partnership s
partnership agreement (the Partnership Agreement to authorize, create or increase the amount of any series of capital
stock or OP Units that rank senior Senior Securities to or pari passu Parity Securities with the Series
C Preferred Units with respect to dividends or distributions, or the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation or the Operating Partnership, as applicable; (ii) amend, alter or waive the charter or the Partnership Agreement
in a manner that would adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series C Preferred Units; (iii) issue any Senior
Securities or Parity Securities, or securities or rights convertible into, or exercisable for, Senior Securities or Parity Securities;
(iv) issue any equity securities of any subsidiary of the Operating Partnership to a third-party; (v) incur, refinance or create any
indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions; (vi) effect a Fundamental Change and (vii) pay dividends or distributions or repurchase
or redeem Parity Securities or securities junior to the Series C Preferred Units with respect to dividend and distribution rights on
liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Operating Partnership or the Company, subject to certain exceptions, including a distribution
to the Company and payment of dividends using all proceeds of such distribution as necessary to maintain the Company s status as
a REIT or to avoid the payment of any federal, state or local income or excise tax. Further, the Investor was granted the right to designate
one non-voting observer on the Board of Directors. Such governance rights may impact our ability to run our business and may adversely
affect the trading price of our common stock.

The Fundamental
Change redemption feature of our Series C Preferred Units may make it more difficult for a party to take over our Company or Operating
Partnership or discourage a party from taking over our Company or Operating Partnership. 

 Upon the occurrence
of Fundamental Change, holders of our Series C Preferred Units will have the right to redeem all of their Series C Preferred Units for
cash at a price determined in accordance with the certificate of designation. The Fundamental Change redemption features of our Series
C Preferred Units may have the effect of discouraging a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or Operating Partnership
or of delaying, deferring or preventing certain change of control transactions of our Company or Operating Partnership under circumstances
that otherwise could provide the holders of our Common Stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-current market price
or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests. 

 OP units
issued upon exercise of the Warrants would be immediately redeemable, for cash or shares of Common Stock at the Company s option.
The exercise of such Warrants and potential redemption of the converted OP Units for shares of Common Stock could have an immediate dilutive
effect on the ownership interests of our common stockholders. 

 On August 26,
2024 (the Initial Issue Date ), the Company issued 11,760,000 Warrants to the Investor. The Warrants will become
exercisable for either OP Units or cash on the fifth anniversary of the Initial Issue Date (the Exercise Period ),
provided, however, that if the volume-weighted average price of the Common Stock for the ninety (90) consecutive trading days ending
on the fifth anniversary of the Initial Issue Date is equal to or less than the applicable conversion price of the Warrants in effect
at such date, then the Exercise Period shall be extended until the seventh anniversary of the Initial Issue Date. The conversion price
of the Warrants may be automatically adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Warrants for, among other things, stock splits and the payment
of dividends, including regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. All OP Units received upon exercise of the Warrants may
be immediately tendered for redemption for cash or for shares of Common Stock at the Company s option, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Warrant Agreement and the Partnership Agreement. To the extent the Warrants are exercised for OP Units and
such OP Units are redeemed for shares of Common Stock, our existing common stockholders would experience an immediate, and potentially
significant, dilutive effect on their ownership interest in the Company, which could cause the market price of our Common Stock to be
materially adversely affected. 

 Furthermore,
pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of August 26, 2024, by and among the Company, the Operating Partnership and the
Investor, the holders of our Warrants have registration rights which provide for customary demand and piggyback 
registration rights for the Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants. We will bear all costs in connection with registration
of the Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants. Sales of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants, or the
perception in the market that the holders of a large number of holders of shares of our Common Stock intend to sell shares of Common Stock,
could reduce the market price of our Common Stock.

in the form of additional fully paid Series C Preferred Units (which may be fractional units) (the PIK Distributions and (ii) distributions in the form of cash (the Cash Distributions ), as set forth in this Section 4 . 

 (b) 
 Distribution Payment Dates and Record Dates . PIK Distributions and Cash Distributions shall be payable quarterly in arrears
on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year (each, a Distribution Payment Date commencing
on the first Distribution Payment Date following the Issue Date. Each distribution will be payable to Holders of record as they appear
in the unit register of the Partnership as of the close of business on the first day of the month, whether or not a Business Day, in which
the relevant Distribution Payment Date occurs (each such first day, a Record Date ). Each period from and including
a Distribution Payment Date (or, for the first Distribution Period, the Issue Date) to, but excluding, the following Distribution Payment
Date, is herein referred to as a Distribution Period . 

 (c) 
 Rate and Accrual of Distributions . PIK Distributions will be payable, for each outstanding Series C Preferred Unit, at
a rate equal to the PIK Distribution Rate. Cash Distributions will be payable, for each outstanding Series C Preferred Unit, at a rate
equal to the Cash Distribution Rate. Distributions on each Series C Preferred Unit shall accrue on the Stated Value thereof and on all
unpaid distributions that have accrued and accumulated for all Distribution Periods ending prior to such date on such share pursuant
to this Section 4(c) , whether or not authorized or declared (the Accrued Distributions ), on
a daily basis and shall compound monthly from and including the Issue Date of such unit, whether or not authorized or declared and whether
or not the Partnership has assets or Partnership Units, as applicable, legally available therefor. If the Partnership fails to pay a
full PIK Distribution and declare and pay a full Cash Distribution on the Series C Preferred Units pursuant to this Section 4(c)
 on any Distribution Payment Date, then the amount of such unpaid distribution shall automatically be added to the amount of Accrued
Distributions on such unit on the applicable Distribution Payment Date without any action on the part of the Partnership or any other
person. The Partnership shall be entitled to declare and pay all or any part of the Accrued Distributions relating to distributions that
were accrued but not paid in full on subsequent Distribution Payment Dates, and, following such payment, such Accrued Distributions shall
no longer be deemed Accrued Distributions hereunder solely to the extent of such payment. Any distribution payment made on Series C Preferred
Units shall first be credited against the earliest Accrued Distribution due with respect to such units which remains payable. Distributions
payable for a Distribution Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. If a scheduled Distribution
Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, (i) the PIK Distribution shall be deemed issued and delivered as of such Distribution
Payment Date, and (ii) the Cash Distribution will be paid on the next Business Day with the same effect as if it were paid on the scheduled
Distribution Payment Date, and no interest or other amount will accrue on such Cash Distribution for the period from and after that Distribution
Payment Date to the date such distribution is paid. All distributions (whether in the form of Cash Distributions or PIK Distributions)
shall be aggregated per Holder and, in the case of Cash Distribution, shall be made to the nearest cent (with 0.005 being rounded upward). 

8 

(d) 
 Cumulation of Distributions . Distributions on the Series C Preferred Units are cumulative. Distribution on
each Series C Preferred Unit shall accrue in the manner provided in Section 4(c) from and after the Issue Date, whether
or not declared, and whether or not there is sufficient cash of the Partnership legally available for the payment of Cash Distribution
 or Partnership Units available for the issuance of PIK Distributions . 

 (e) 
 Priority . So long as any Series C Preferred Unit remains outstanding, (i) no dividend or distribution shall be declared
and paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared and made or set aside for payment on any Junior Securities of
the Partnership or the Corporation; and (ii) no Junior Securities shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration
by the Partnership or the Corporation, directly or indirectly, unless, in each case, full distributions on all outstanding Series C Preferred
Units and Parity Securities for all prior completed Distribution Periods, if any, have been paid (or have been declared and a sum sufficient
for the payment thereof has been set aside). So long as any Series C Preferred Unit remains outstanding, (i) no dividends or distributions
shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment on any Parity Securities (other than the Series C Preferred Units) for any period;
and (ii) no Parity Securities (other than the Series C Preferred Units) shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration
by the Partnership or the Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Parity Securities for or
into Junior Securities or the exchange or conversion of Parity Securities for or into Junior Securities), unless, in each case, full distributions
on all outstanding Series C Preferred Units for all prior completed Distribution Periods have been paid in full or declared and a sum
sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for all outstanding Series C Preferred Units. To the extent the Partnership declares distributions
on the Series C Preferred Units and on any Parity Securities but does not make full payment of such declared distributions, the Partnership
shall allocate the distribution payments on a pro rata basis among the holders of the shares of Series C Preferred Units and the holders
of any Parity Securities then outstanding. For purposes of calculating the pro rata allocation of partial distribution payments, the Partnership
shall allocate those payments so that the respective amounts of those payments bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued and unpaid
distributions per Series C Preferred Unit and all Parity Securities (which, in the case of any such
Parity Securities shall not include any accumulation in respect of unpaid distributions for past distribution periods if such Parity Securities
do not have a cumulative distribution) bear to each other. 

 (f) 
 Method of Payment and Delivery of Distributions . Distributions shall be made to the Holders entitled thereto on each Distribution
Payment Date as set forth in Section 4(b) . PIK Distributions shall be payable in kind in fully paid Series C Preferred Units
and shall be automatically credited to the account of the Holder entitled thereto without any further action required on the part of such
Holder. Payments of Cash Distributions will be delivered to the Holder entitled thereto by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account of such Holder provided in writing to the Partnership no later than the related Record Date. 

 (g) 
 Treatment of Distributions When the Redemption Date Occurs After a Record Date and on or Before the Related Distribution Payment
Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate, if the Redemption Date for any Series C Preferred Unit to be redeemed
is after the Record Date for any distribution (whether declared or otherwise due) and on or prior to the related Distribution Payment
Date, then (i) the Holder of record of such share as of the close of business on such Record Date shall receive such distribution on
or, at the Partnership s election, before such Distribution Payment Date, notwithstanding such redemption; and (ii) the Redemption
Price shall include any accrued distributions in respect of the Distribution Period corresponding to such distribution referred to in
this Section 4(g) .

 The Partnership shall not voluntarily commence any liquidation, dissolution or winding up without the consent of the Holders of
Series C Preferred Units as set forth in Section 10 hereof. 

 (b)

Units at the time shall be entitled to receive liquidating distributions in an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference of such Series
C Preferred Units out of assets legally available for distribution, before any distribution of assets is made to the holders of any other
Junior Securities of the Partnership. After payment of the full amount of such liquidating distributions, the Holders will not be entitled
to any further participation in any distribution of assets by, and shall have no right or claim to any remaining assets of, the Partnership
in respect of such Series C Preferred Units. 

 (c) 
 In the event the assets of the Partnership available for distribution to Partners upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
of the affairs of the Partnership, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full the amounts payable with respect
to all outstanding Series C Preferred Units and amounts payable on any Parity Securities of the Partnership, Holders and the holders of
such Parity Securities shall share ratably in any distribution of assets of the Partnership in proportion to their full respective liquidating
distributions (including, if applicable, accrued and unpaid distributions) to which they
would otherwise be respectively entitled. 

 (d) 
 Following the satisfaction of the liquidation preferences set forth in Section 5(b) and Section 5(c) ,
the Partnership shall continue the distribution of any remaining assets in such liquidation, dissolution or winding up in accordance with
the terms of the main part of the Partnership Agreement. 

 (e) 
 The Partnership s consolidation or merger with or into any other entity, the consolidation or merger of any other entity
with or into the Partnership, or the sale of all or substantially all of the Partnership s property or business will not constitute

whose performance would constitute a Fundamental Change, the Partnership shall, to the extent it has funds legally available to do so,
be required to redeem the Series C Preferred Units, in whole, on a Redemption Date (determined in accordance with Section 7(c) occurring on or before the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change, at the Redemption Price. A redemption pursuant to this Section
 7(b) will be deemed to occur immediately before the consummation of such Fundamental Change. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 7(b) , if, after sending a Redemption Notice for a redemption pursuant to this Section 7(b) ,
the Partnership or the Corporation, as applicable, publicly announces that the related Fundamental Change will not occur, then such Redemption
Notice will be deemed to be automatically rescinded, without the need for any further action on the part of the Partnership or the Corporation,
as applicable, or any other Person. In the case of any such rescission, the Partnership or the Corporation, as applicable, will, as soon
as 

10 

reasonably practicable, send notice of the same to each Holder. In the event of a Fundamental Change at a time when the Partnership
is restricted or prohibited (contractually or otherwise) from redeeming some or all of the Series C Preferred Units, the Partnership shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite consents or approvals to remove or obtain an exception or waiver to such restrictions
or prohibition. Nothing herein shall limit the right of a holder of Series C Preferred Units to pursue any other remedies available to
it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect
to the Partnership s failure to comply with its obligations under this Certificate.

for payment of the Redemption Price or, in the case of Series C Preferred Units held in book-entry form, the applicable procedures with
respect thereto. 

 Any such Redemption Notice provided
by the Partnership shall be irrevocable, except as provided in Section 7(b) . 

 (d) 
 Redemption Price . Subject to Section 4(g) , the Redemption Price for any Series C Preferred Unit to be redeemed
on a Redemption Date will be a cash amount equal to the Liquidation Preference of such unit. 

 (e) 
 Effect of Redemption Notice . If notice of redemption of any Series C Preferred
Units has been given and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been irrevocably set aside by the Partnership, separate and apart
from its other funds, in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Series C Preferred Units so called for redemption, then, subject
to Section 4(g) , from and after the Redemption Date (unless default shall be made by the Partnership in providing for the
payment of the Redemption Price), distributions will cease to accrue on such Series C Preferred Units, such Series C Preferred Units shall
no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such Series C Preferred Units will terminate, except the right to receive
the Redemption Price. In the event that any Redemption Date shall not be a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price need not
be made on such Redemption Date but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such

to such next succeeding Business Day. The Partnership shall pay the aggregate Redemption Price to each Holder by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

of shares of Series C Preferred Units held in book-entry form, upon satisfaction of the
applicable procedures with respect to redemptions), such Series C Preferred Units shall be redeemed by the Partnership at the Redemption
Price.

payment immediately upon the availability of funds or Partnership Units legally available therefor. During the pendency of non-payment
of any required amounts in respect of the Series C Preferred Units, including as a result of the failure of the General Partner to authorize
and declare such payment for any reason, beginning on and including the last Distribution Payment Date upon which the Partnership paid
in full all accrued and unpaid Distributions and continuing through the day upon which the Partnership pays in full all such owed amounts,
the applicable Cash Distribution Rate in effect shall be increased by 4.0 per annum, accruing daily and compounding monthly (the Penalty
Rate ). Neither the Partnership nor the Corporation shall execute and deliver any agreement whose performance would constitute

the Series C Preferred Units in accordance with Section 7(b) .

to Holders of shares of Series C Preferred Units the option to purchase a pro rata portion of such New Equity Preemptive Securities
offered in such transaction (such pro rata portion offered to each Holder of shares of Series C Preferred Units determined by dividing 
(i) the total Stated Value plus all accrued and unpaid distributions (including Accrued Distributions) on such unit (whether
or not authorized or declared) of Series C Preferred Units owned by such Holder immediately prior to such issuance of New Equity
Preemptive Securities by (ii) the total Stated Value plus all accrued and unpaid distributions (including Accrued Distributions)
on all units (whether or not authorized or declared) of Series C Preferred Units outstanding immediately prior to such issuance of
New Equity Preemptive Securities); provided, that each Holder shall have the right to designate any of its Affiliates to purchase such
pro rata portion of such New Equity Preemptive Securities offered in such transaction in accordance with the terms of this Section 12 so
long as such Affiliate agrees to be bound by the customary obligations of such Holder incident to the ownership of such New Equity Preemptive
Securities set forth in agreements such Holder is party to with the Partnership or the Corporation, as applicable. 

 13. 
 Transferability . Notwithstanding anything in the main part of the Partnership Agreement to the contrary, the Series C Preferred
Units shall not be subject to any restrictions on transferability and the Holders thereof shall be permitted, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, to offer, sell, assign, hypothecate, pledge or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its Series C Preferred Units,
or any economic rights therein, whether voluntarily or by operation of law or at judicial sale or otherwise, in each case, without the
consent of the Partnership, the General Partner, any Limited Partners or any other Person, by delivering a Transfer Notice substantially

that nothing contained herein shall prevent such Holder or the Partnership from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
governmental authority based upon or arising out of the foregoing, and no such person shall be required to litigate before any court any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any governmental authority challenging the foregoing. The provisions of Exhibit C are
incorporated herein by reference. The Partnership shall allocate income using the interim closing method as described in U.S. Treasury
Regulations Section 1.706-4.

the event of any conflict between the Partnership Agreement and this Certificate, the provisions set forth in this Certificate shall control. 

 16.

Exhibit
C 

 ALLOCATION OF PROFIT AND LOSS 

 Notwithstanding anything in the
main part of the Partnership Agreement to the contrary, so long as any Series C Preferred Unit issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement
remains outstanding (for purposes of this Exhibit C , Preferred Unit ), Profit and Loss for each
fiscal year of the Partnership in which a Preferred Unit is outstanding shall be allocated to each Holder of such Preferred Unit in each
fiscal year and in respect of such Preferred Unit as follows: 

 (a) 
 After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Sections 5.01(b) and (c) of the main part of the Partnership Agreement
(as amended by this Certificate, if applicable), net Profits (excluding any gross items) shall be allocated to such Holder in respect
of such Preferred Unit during such fiscal year in a manner that will cause the Adjusted Capital Account balance of such Holder with respect
to such Preferred Unit to be equal, as nearly as possible, to the amount distributable to such Holder if the Partnership were dissolved,
its affairs wound up and its assets sold for cash equal to their fair market value, all Partnership liabilities were satisfied (limited
with respect to each nonrecourse liability to the fair market value of the asset securing such liability), and the net assets of the Partnership
were distributed in accordance with Section 5(b) of this Certificate; provided that, for purposes of the foregoing allocation
of Profit, the Liquidation Preference shall be calculated without regard to the Minimum Amount unless any portion of the Minimum Amount
is actually distributed to such Holder during such fiscal year in excess of such Holder s Capital Account balance. Profit shall
be thereafter allocated to Partners other than Holders of Preferred Units in accordance with the main part of the Partnership Agreement. 

 (b) 
 Loss for any fiscal year shall be first allocated to Partners (other than Holders of Preferred Units) in accordance with Section
5.01(a) of the main part of the Partnership Agreement until such time as the balance of the Adjusted Capital Accounts of such Partners
are reduced to zero, and thereafter, allocated to Holders of Preferred Units in proportion to their Adjusted Capital Account balances
with respect to their Preferred Units until the balance of the Adjusted Capital Accounts of such Holders is reduced to zero. For purposes
of this Exhibit C , Adjusted Capital Account means the Capital Account maintained for each Partner,
(i) increased by any amounts that such Partner is obligated to restore or is treated as obligated to restore under Treasury Regulation
Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c), 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5), and (ii) decreased by any amounts described in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) and (6) with respect to such Partner. The foregoing definition of Adjusted Capital Account 
is intended to comply with the provisions of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and 1.704-2 and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith. The foregoing allocations and the allocations pursuant to clause (a) are intended to reflect allocations of Profit and
Loss for purposes of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. 

 (c) 
 To the extent permissible under applicable law, the Partnership shall allocate items of income, gain, expense, and loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes consistently with the allocations of Profit pursuant to clause (a) and allocations of Loss pursuant
to clause (b); provided that, the Partnership shall use the traditional method as described under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(b)
with respect to built-in gain in the assets of the Partnership at the time of the purchase of such Preferred Unit. 

C- 1 

(d) 
 The initial Capital Account balance of a Holder in respect of a Preferred Unit upon issuance of such unit shall be the Stated Value
of such Preferred Unit. No items of taxable income or gain are intended to be allocated to such Holder and no taxable or other recognition
event (including a guaranteed payment) is intended to be reported for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in each case, in respect of any
difference between such Capital Account balance and the purchase price of such Preferred Unit as determined pursuant to Section 6.11 of
the Purchase Agreement. Such Holder is not intended to have a share of Code Section 704(c) gain or loss in any asset as a result of such
difference. The Partnership shall not take any tax position inconsistent with the foregoing intent, except as required by a final determination
as described in Section 1313(a) of the Code (or similar provision of state and local law). 

 (e) 
 Nonrecourse deductions within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-2(b)(1) shall be allocated consistently with
allocations of other significant partnership items attributable to the applicable property, as determined by the General Partner in its
good faith discretion. A Partner s interest in partnership profits for purposes of determining its share of the nonrecourse
liabilities of the Partnership within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3) shall be determined in accordance with the economic
arrangements of the Partners, as determined by the General Partner in its good faith discretion. 

 (f) 
 The Partnership shall take all applicable state and local tax position consistent with the foregoing. 

 (g) 
 The Partnership shall not settle any material tax audit of the Partnership or any subsidiary thereof without good faith consultation
and consent of the Holders of a majority of the outstanding the Preferred Units (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed);
provided that the Partnership may do so if the yield in respect of the Preferred Units or any other rights of the Holders of such Preferred
Units is not adversely impacted as a result thereof. 

 For the avoidance of doubt, if
no Preferred Unit is outstanding during a fiscal year, then the allocation of Profit and Loss for such fiscal year shall be made in accordance
with the main part of the Partnership Agreement. For purposes of this Exhibit, Partners shall have the meaning
given in the main part of the Partnership Agreement and shall include the Holders.

by the Holder. 

 (e) Strike Price and Warrant Entitlement
Adjustments . 

 (i) Events
Requiring an Adjustment to the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement . Each of the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement will
be adjusted from time to time as follows: 

 (1) Stock
Dividends, Splits and Combinations . If the Company issues solely Partnership Units as a dividend or distribution on all or substantially
all Partnership Units, or if the Company effects a unit split or a unit combination of the Partnership Units (in each case excluding an
issuance solely pursuant to a Partnership Unit Change Event, as to which Section 5(f) will apply), then each of the Strike
Price and the Warrant Entitlement will be adjusted based on the following formulas: 

and 

where: 

 SP 0 = the
Strike Price in effect immediately before the Open of Business on the effective date of such dividend, distribution, unit split or unit
 combination , as applicable; 

 SP 1 = the
Strike Price in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such effective date; 

 WE 0 = the
Warrant Entitlement in effect immediately before the Open of Business on such effective date; 

 WE 1 = the
Warrant Entitlement in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such effective date; 

16 

OS 0 = the
number of Partnership Units outstanding immediately before the Open of Business on such effective
date without giving effect to such dividend, distribution, unit split or unit combination; and 

 OS 1 = the
number of Partnership Units outstanding immediately after giving effect to such dividend, distribution, unit split or unit combination. 

 If any dividend, distribution,
unit split or unit combination of the type described in this Section 5(e)(i)(1) is declared or announced, but not so paid
or made, then each of the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement will be readjusted, effective as of the date the Company determines
not to pay such dividend or distribution or to effect such unit split or unit combination, to the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement,
respectively, that would then be in effect had such dividend, distribution, unit split or unit combination not been declared or announced. 

 (2) Rights,
Options and Warrants . If the Parent distributes, to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, rights, options or warrants
(other than rights issued or otherwise distributed pursuant to a stockholder rights plan, as to which Section 5(e)(i)(3)(A) 
will apply) entitling such holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share that is less than the average
of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days ending on, and including, the Trading
Day immediately before the date such distribution is announced, then each of the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement will be adjusted
based on the following formulas: 

and 

where: 

 SP 0 = the
Strike Price in effect immediately before the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; 

 SP 1 = the
Strike Price in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date; 

 WE 0 = the
Warrant Entitlement in effect immediately before the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date; 

 WE 1 = the
Warrant Entitlement in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date; 

OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before the Open of Business on such
Ex-Dividend Date; 

17 

Y = a number of shares of Common Stock obtained by dividing (x) the aggregate price payable to exercise
such rights, options or warrants by (y) the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive
Trading Days ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately before the date such distribution is announced; and 

X = the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants. 

 To the extent such rights, options
or warrants are not so distributed, each of the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement will be readjusted to the Strike Price and the
Warrant Entitlement, respectively, that would then be in effect had the adjustment thereto for such distribution been made on the basis
of only the rights, options or warrants, if any, actually distributed. In addition, to the extent that shares of Common Stock are not
delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants (including as a result of such rights, options or warrants not being
exercised), the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement will be readjusted to the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement, respectively,
that would then be in effect had the adjustment thereto for such distribution been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of
shares of Common Stock actually delivered upon exercise of such rights, option or warrants. 

 For purposes of this Section 5(e)(i)(2) ,
in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle holders of Common Stock to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock
at a price per share that is less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive
Trading Days ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately before the date the distribution of such rights, options or warrants
is announced, and in determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or
warrants, there will be taken into account any consideration the Parent receives for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable
on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if not cash, to be reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
upon advice of its financial and other advisors. 

 (3) Spin-Offs
and Other Distributed Property . 

 (A) Distributions
Other than Spin-Offs . If the Parent distributes shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of the Parent s indebtedness or other
assets or property of the Parent, or rights, options or warrants to acquire the Parent s Capital Stock or other securities, to all
or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, excluding: 

 (I) dividends,
distributions, rights, options or warrants for which an adjustment to the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement is required pursuant
to Section 5(e)(i)(2) ; 

 (II) dividends
or distributions paid exclusively in cash for which an adjustment to the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement is required pursuant
to Section 5(e)(i)(4) ; 

 (III) rights
issued or otherwise distributed pursuant to a stockholder rights plan, except to the extent provided in Section 5(e)(v) ; 

18 

(IV) Spin-Offs
for which an adjustment to the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement is required pursuant to Section 5(e)(i)(3)(B) ; and 

 (V) a
distribution solely pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of Common Stock, as to which Section 5(e)(i)(5) 
will apply, 

 then each 
of the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement will be adjusted based on the following formulas: 

and 

where : 

 SP 0 = the
Strike Price in effect immediately before the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; 

 SP 1 = the
Strike Price in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date; 

 WE 0 = the
Warrant Entitlement in effect immediately before the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date; 

 WE 1 = the
Warrant Entitlement in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date; 

P = the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive
Trading Days ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately before such Ex-Dividend Date; and 

FMV = the fair market value (as reasonably determined by the Company or Parent in good faith upon advice
of its financial and other advisors), as of such Ex Dividend Date, of the shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets,
property, rights, options or warrants distributed per share of Common Stock pursuant to such distribution; 

 provided , however ,
that, if FMV is equal to or greater than P , then, in lieu of the foregoing adjustments to the Strike Price and the Warrant
Entitlement, each Holder will receive from the Company, for each Warrant held by such Holder on the Record 
Date for such distribution, at the same time and on the same terms as holders of Common Stock, the amount and kind of shares of Capital
Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, property, rights, options or warrants that such Holder would have received in such distribution
if such Holder had owned, on such Record Date, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Warrant Entitlement multiplied by 
the Conversion Factor in effect on such Record Date. 

19 

To the extent such distribution
is not so paid or made, each of the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement will be readjusted to the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement,
respectively, that would then be in effect had the adjustment thereto been made on the basis of only the distribution, if any, actually
made or paid. 

 (B) Spin-Offs .
If the Parent distributes or dividends shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to
an Affiliate or Subsidiary or other business unit of the Parent to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock (other than solely
pursuant to (x) a Partnership Unit Change Event as applied to the Common Stock pursuant to Section 5(f)(ii) , as to which Section 5(f) 
will apply; or (y) a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of Common Stock, as to which Section 5(e)(i)(5) will apply),
and such Capital Stock or equity interests are listed or quoted (or will be listed or quoted upon the consummation of the transaction)
on a U.S. national securities exchange (a Spin Off ), then each of the Strike Price and the Warrant
Entitlement will be adjusted based on the following formulas: 

and 

where : 

 SP 0 = the
Strike Price in effect immediately before the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such Spin-Off; 

 SP 1 = the
Strike Price in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date; 

 WE 0 = the
Warrant Entitlement in effect immediately before the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date; 

 WE 1 = the
Warrant Entitlement in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date; 

P = the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for each Trading Day in the
Spin-Off Valuation Period; and 

FMV = the product of (x) the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share or unit of the Capital
Stock or equity interests distributed in such Spin Off over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period (the Spin Off
Valuation Period beginning on, and including, such Ex Dividend Date (such average to be determined as if references
to Common Stock in the definitions of Last Reported Sale Price, Trading Day and Market Disruption Event 
were instead references to such Capital Stock or equity interests); and (y) the number of shares 

20 

or units of such Capital Stock or equity interests
distributed per share of Common Stock in such Spin-Off. 

 The adjustment to the Strike
Price and the Warrant Entitlement pursuant to this Section 5(e)(i)(3)(B) will be calculated as of the Close of Business on
the last Trading Day of the Spin-Off Valuation Period but will be given effect immediately after the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend
Date for the Spin-Off, with retroactive effect. If any Warrant is exercised and the Exercise Date for such exercise occurs during the
Spin-Off Valuation Period, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Warrant Agreement, the Company will, if necessary, delay
the settlement of such exercise until the second (2nd) Business Day after the Last Trading Day of the Spin-Off Valuation Period; provided ,
 however , that in the case such delayed settlement would be necessary, the Holder may elect instead to forego such adjustment and
the Company shall not be entitled to any such delay. 

 To the extent any dividend
or distribution of the type described in this Section 5(e)(i)(3)(B) is declared but not made or paid, each of the Strike Price
and the Warrant Entitlement will be readjusted to the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement, respectively, that would then be in effect
had the adjustment thereto been made on the basis of only the dividend or distribution, if any, actually made or paid. 

 (4) Cash
Dividends or Distributions . If any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, then
each of the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement will be adjusted based on the following formulas: 

and 

where: 

 SP 0 = the
Strike Price in effect immediately before the Open of Business on the Ex Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution; 

 SP 1 = the
Strike Price in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such Ex Dividend Date; 

 WE 0 = the
Warrant Entitlement in effect immediately before the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date; 

 WE 1 = the
Warrant Entitlement in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date; 

P = the Last Reported Sale Price per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately before such
Ex-Dividend Date; and 

21 

D = the cash amount distributed per share of Common Stock in such dividend or distribution. 

 provided , however ,
that, if D is equal to or greater than P , then, in lieu of the foregoing adjustments to the Strike Price and the Warrant
Entitlement, each Holder will receive from the Company, for each Warrant held by such Holder on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution,
at the same time and on the same terms as holders of Common Stock, the amount of cash that such Holder would have received in such dividend
or distribution if such Holder had owned, on such Record Date, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Warrant Entitlement multiplied
by the Conversion Factor in effect on such Record Date. To the extent such dividend or distribution is declared but not made or paid,
each of the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement will be readjusted to the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement, respectively,
that would then be in effect had the adjustment thereto been made on the basis of only the dividend or distribution, if any, actually
made or paid. 

 (5) Tender
Offers or Exchange Offers . If the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer
for shares of Common Stock, and the value (reasonably determined as of the Expiration Time by the Parent or the Company in good faith
upon advice of its financial and other advisors) of the cash and other consideration paid per share of Common Stock in such tender or
exchange offer exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately after the last date (the
 Expiration Date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it
may be amended), then each of the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement will be adjusted based on the following formulas: 

and 

where: 

 SP 0 = the
Strike Price in effect immediately before the time such tender or exchange offer expires (the Expiration Time ); 

 SP 1 = the
Strike Price in effect immediately after the Expiration Time; 

 WE 0 = the
Warrant Entitlement in effect immediately before the Expiration Time; 

 WE 1 = the
Warrant Entitlement in effect immediately after the Expiration Time; 

P = the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share of Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive
Trading Day period (the Tender/Exchange Offer Valuation Period beginning on, and including, the Trading Day
immediately after the Expiration Date; 

22 

OS 0 = the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before the Expiration Time (including all shares of Common Stock accepted for
purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer); 

AC = the aggregate value (determined as of the Expiration Time by the Company in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner) of all cash and other consideration paid for shares of Common Stock purchased or exchanged in such tender or exchange
offer; and 

 OS 1 = the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Expiration Time (excluding all shares of Common Stock accepted for
purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer); 

 provided , however ,
that the Strike Price will in no event be adjusted up, and the Warrant Entitlement will in no event be adjusted down, pursuant to this
 Section 5(e)(i)(5) , except to the extent provided in the last paragraph of this Section 5(e)(i)(5) . 

 The adjustment to the Strike
Price and the Warrant Entitlement pursuant to this Section 5(e)(i)(5) will be calculated as of the Close of Business on the
last Trading Day of the Tender/Exchange Offer Valuation Period but will be given effect immediately after the Expiration Time, with retroactive
effect. If any Warrant is exercised and the Exercise Date for such exercise occurs on the Expiration Date or during the Tender/Exchange
Offer Valuation Period, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Warrant Agreement, the Company will, if necessary, delay
the settlement of such exercise until the second (2nd) Business Day after the last Trading Day of the Tender/Exchange Offer Valuation
Period; provided , however , that in the case such delayed settlement would be necessary, the Holder may elect instead to
forego such adjustment and the Company shall not be entitled to any such delay. 

 To the extent such tender or
exchange offer is announced but not consummated (including as a result of being precluded from consummating such tender or exchange offer
under applicable law), or any purchases or exchanges of shares of Common Stock in such tender or exchange offer are rescinded, each of
the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement will be readjusted to the Strike Price and the Warrant Entitlement, respectively, that would
then be in effect had the adjustment thereto been made on the basis of only the purchases or exchanges of shares of Common Stock, if any,
actually made, and not rescinded, in such tender or exchange offer. 

 (6) Degressive
Issuances . Subject to Section 5(f) , if, on or after the Initial Issue Date, the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries issues
or otherwise sells any shares of Common Stock, Partnership Units or any Equity-Linked Securities, in each case at an Effective Price per
share of Common Stock or Partnership Unit, as applicable, that is less than the Strike Price in effect (before giving effect to the adjustment
required by this Section 5(e)(i)(6) as of the date of the issuance or sale of such shares, units or Equity-Linked Securities
(such an issuance or sale, a Degressive Issuance ), then, effective as of the Close of Business on such date,
the Strike Price will be decreased to an amount equal to the Weighted Average Issuance Price. For these purposes, the Weighted
Average Issuance Price will be equal to: 

23 

where: 

SP = the Strike Price in effect immediately before giving effect to the adjustment required by this Section 5(e)(i)(6) ; 

OS = the number of shares of Common Stock or Partnership Units (as applicable) outstanding immediately
before such Degressive Issuance, plus, without duplication, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock or Partnership Units (as applicable)
underlying all Equity-Linked Securities of the Parent or the Company (as applicable) (other than the Equity-Linked Securities, if any,
issued or sold in such Degressive Issuance) outstanding immediately before such Degressive Issuance; 

EP = such Effective Price per share of Common Stock or Partnership Unit (as applicable) in such Degressive
Issuance; provided , however , that if such Degressive Issuance involves the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock, Partnership
Units or Equity-Linked Securities (as applicable) at differing Effective Prices, then EP will be calculated as the weighted-average of
such Effective Prices, with each such Effective Price being weighted by the number of shares of Common Stock or Partnership Units (as
applicable) issued or sold at such Effective Price in such Degressive Issuance or the maximum number of shares of Common Stock or Partnership
Units (as applicable) underlying such Equity-Linked Securities issued or sold at such Effective Price in such Degressive Issuance, as
applicable; and 

X = the sum, without duplication, of (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock or Partnership Units
(as applicable) issued or sold in such Degressive Issuance, and (y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock or Partnership Units
(as applicable) underlying such Equity-Linked Securities issued or sold in such Degressive Issuance; 

 provided , however ,
that: (A) the Strike Price will not be adjusted pursuant to this Section 5(e)(i)(6) solely as a result of an Exempt Issuance;
(B) the issuance of shares of Common Stock or Partnership Units (as applicable) pursuant to any such Equity-Linked Securities will not
constitute an additional issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock or Partnership Units (as applicable) for purposes of this Section 5(e)(i)(6) 
(it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the issuance or sale of such Equity-Linked Securities, or any re-pricing or amendment
thereof, will be subject to this Section 5(e)(i)(6) ); and (C) in no event will the Strike Price be increased pursuant to this
 Section 5(e)(i)(6) . For purposes of this Section 5(e)(i)(6) , any re-pricing or amendment of any Equity Linked
Securities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Equity Linked Securities existing as of the Initial Issue Date) will be deemed
to be the issuance of additional Equity-Linked Securities, without affecting any prior adjustments theretofore made to the Strike Price. 

 (ii) No
Adjustments in Certain Cases . 

 (1) Where
Holders Participate in the Transaction or Event Without Exercising . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5(e)(i) ,
the Company is 

24 

not required to adjust the Strike Price or the
Warrant Entitlement for a transaction or other event otherwise requiring an adjustment pursuant to Section 5(e)(i) (other
than a unit split or combination of the type set forth in Section 5(e)(i)(1) or a tender or exchange offer of the type set
forth in Section 5(e)(i)(5) if each Holder participates, at the same time and on the same terms as holders of Common Stock,
and solely by virtue of being a Holder of the Warrants, in such transaction or event without having to exercise such Holder s Warrants
and as if such Holder had owned, on the Record Date for such transaction or event, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product
of (i) the Warrant Entitlement multiplied by the Conversion Factor in effect on such Record Date; and (ii) the number of Warrants
held by such Holder on such Record Date. 

 (2) Certain
Events . The Company will not be required to adjust the Strike Price or the Warrant Entitlement except pursuant to Section 5(e)(i) .
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company will not be required to adjust the Strike Price or the Warrant Entitlement on account of: 

 (A) the
issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest
payable on the Company s securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any such plan; 

 (B) the
issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future employee,
director or consultant benefit plan or program of, or assumed by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which plan or program is conducted
in the ordinary course of business and consistent with the Company s past practice; 

 (C) the
issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or convertible or exchangeable security of the Company outstanding
as of the Initial Issue Date and pursuant to the terms of any such security as in effect as of the Initial Issue Date; or 

 (D) solely
a change in the par value of the Common Stock. 

 (iii) Adjustments
Not Yet Effective . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Warrant Agreement, if: 

 (1) a
Warrant is exercised; 

 (2) the
Record Date, effective date or Expiration Time for any event that requires an adjustment to the Strike Price pursuant to Section 5(e)(i) 
has occurred on or before the Exercise Date for such exercise, but an adjustment to the Strike Price or the Warrant Entitlement for such
event has not yet become effective as of such Exercise Date; 

 (3) the
Exercise Consideration due upon such exercise includes any whole Partnership Units; and 

 (4) such
Partnership Units are not entitled to participate in such event (because they were not held on the related Record Date or otherwise), 

 then, solely for purposes of
such exercise, the Company will, without duplication, give effect to such adjustment on such Exercise Date. In such case, if the date
on which the Company is otherwise 

25 

required to deliver the Exercise Consideration
due upon such exercise is before the first date on which the amount of such adjustment can be determined, then the Company will delay
the settlement of such exercise until the second (2nd) Business Day after such first date; provided , however , that in the
case such delayed settlement would be necessary, the Holder may elect instead to forego such adjustment and the Company shall not be entitled
to any such delay. 

 (iv) Adjustments
Where Exercising Holders Participate in the Relevant Transaction or Event . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Warrant
Agreement, if: 

 (1) an
adjustment to the Strike Price or the Warrant Entitlement for any dividend or distribution becomes effective on any Ex-Dividend Date pursuant
to Section 5(e)(i) ; 

 (2) a
Warrant is exercised; 

 (3) the
Exercise Date for such exercise occurs on or after such Ex-Dividend Date and on or before the related Record Date; 

 (4) the
Exercise Consideration due upon such exercise includes any whole Partnership Units based on a Strike Price or Warrant Entitlement
that is adjusted for such dividend or distribution ; and 

 (5) such
Partnership Units would be entitled to participate in such dividend or distribution, 

 then such adjustment will not
be given effect for such exercise and the Partnership Units issuable upon such exercise based on such unadjusted Strike Price and unadjusted
Warrant Entitlement will not be entitled to participate in such dividend or distribution, but there will be added, to the Exercise Consideration
otherwise due upon such exercise, the same kind and amount of consideration that would have been delivered in such dividend or distribution
with respect to such Partnership Units had such Partnership Units been entitled to participate in such dividend or distribution. 

 (v) Determination
of the Number of Outstanding Shares . For purposes of Section 5(e)(i) ,
 the number of shares of Common Stock or Partnership Units outstanding at any time will (1) include shares or units issuable in
respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock or Partnership Units; and (2) exclude shares of Common
Stock held in the Parent s treasury or Partnership Units held in the Company s treasury (unless the Parent or the Company,
as applicable, pays any dividend or makes any distribution on such shares or units held in its treasury). 

 (vi) Rounding
of Calculations . All calculations with respect to the Strike Price and adjustments thereto will be made to the nearest cent (with
half of one cent rounded upwards), and all calculations with respect to the Warrant Entitlement and adjustments thereto will be made to
the nearest 1/10,000th of a Partnership Unit (with 5/100,000ths rounded upward). 

 (vii) Equitable
Adjustments . It is the intent of the Parent, the Company and the Holders that the adjustments to the Warrant Entitlement and the Strike
Price of the Warrants as a result of actions taken by the Parent or the Company in the manners described in Section 5(e)(i) 
be addressed equitably and in a manner so as to preserve the economic interests of the Holders hereunder. In furtherance and without limitation
of the foregoing, the Parent, the Company and the Holders agree that (a) no adjustment shall be duplicated when applicable to substantially
similar actions taken by both the Parent and the Company in accordance with Section 5(e)(i) unless the context requires 

26 

otherwise or when such adjustments would be accounted
for in the A R LPA or by the Conversion Factor in connection with an exercise of an Exchange Right with respect to the Exercise Units
and (b) an adjustment shall be made in accordance with Section 5(e)(i) when applicable to an action taken by the Parent or
the Company, whether the Parent or the Company is specifically named in any such provision of Section 5(e)(i) , so long as
one of the Parent or the Company is named in such provision. 

 (viii) Statement
Regarding Adjustments . Whenever the Strike Price Warrant Entitlement shall be adjusted (or there shall be any other adjustment to
the terms of any Warrant), the Company shall, within five (5) Business Days thereafter, send a written notice to each Holder, including
a statement showing in reasonable detail the facts requiring such adjustment and the Strike Price and Warrant Entitlement that shall be
in effect after such adjustment. 

 (f) Effect of Partnership Unit Change
Event . 

 (i) Generally .
If there occurs any: 

 (1) recapitalization,
reclassification or change of the Partnership Unit, other than (x) changes solely resulting from a subdivision or combination of the Partnership
Unit, (y) a change only in par value or from par value to no par value or no par value to par value or (z) unit splits and unit combinations
that do not involve the issuance of any other series or class of securities; 

 (2) consolidation,
merger, combination or binding or statutory share exchange involving the Company; 

 (3) sale,
lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person;
or 

 (4) other
similar event, 

 and, as a result of which,
the Partnership Unit is converted into, or is exchanged for, or represents solely the right to receive, other securities, cash or other
property, or any combination of the foregoing (such an event, a Partnership Unit Change Event , and such other
securities, cash or property, the Reference Property , and the amount and kind of Reference Property that a
holder of one (1) Partnership Unit would be entitled to receive on account of such Partnership Unit Change Event (without giving effect
to any arrangement not to issue or deliver a fractional portion of any security or other property), a Reference Property
Unit ), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Warrant Agreement, 

 (A) from
and after the effective time of such Partnership Unit Change Event, (I) the consideration due upon exercise of any Warrant will be determined
in the same manner as if each reference to any number of Partnership Units in this Section 5 or in Section 6 ,
or in any related definitions, were instead a reference to the same number of Reference Property Units; 

 (B) if
such Reference Property Unit includes, but does not consist entirely of, cash (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that clause (C) 
below will apply instead of this clause (B) if such Reference Property Unit consists entirely of cash ),
then, from and after the effective time of such Partnership Unit Change Event, there will be deducted or removed, as applicable, from
the Aggregate Strike Price otherwise payable to exercise any Warrant pursuant to 

27 

Section 5(c) , and from the cash that
would otherwise be included in the Exercise Consideration due, pursuant to Section 5(d) , to settle such exercise, in each
case pursuant to Physical Settlement, a cash amount, per Warrant, equal to the product of (I) the Warrant Entitlement on the Exercise
Date for such exercise; and (II) the lesser of (x) the Strike Price on the Exercise Date for such exercise; and (y) the amount of cash
included in such Reference Property Unit; 

 (C) if
such Reference Property Unit consists entirely of cash, then (I) from and after the effective time of such Partnership Unit Change Event,
no delivery of the Aggregate Strike Price will be required to exercise any Warrant; and (II) the Company will settle each 
exercise of any Warrant whose Exercise Date occurs on or after the date of the effective time of such Partnership Unit Change Event by
paying, on or before the tenth (10th) Business Day immediately after such Exercise Date, cash in an amount, per Warrant, equal to the
product of (I) the Warrant Entitlement; and (II) the excess, if any, of (x) the amount of cash included in such Reference Property Unit
over (y) the Strike Price (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the amount set forth in this clause (II) 
will be zero if the amount set forth in clause (x) is not greater than the amount set forth in clause (y) ); and 

 (D) for
these purposes, the Last Reported Sale Price of any Reference Property Unit or portion thereof that does not consist of a class of securities
will be the fair value of such Reference Property Unit or portion thereof, as applicable, reasonably determined in 
good faith by the Company upon the advice of its financial and other advisors (or, in the case of cash denominated in U.S. dollars,
the face amount thereof). 

 If the Reference Property consists
of more than a single type of consideration to be determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election, then the composition
of the Reference Property Unit will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration actually received,
per Partnership Unit, by the holders of Partnership Units. The Company will notify the Holders of such weighted average as soon as practicable
after such determination is made. 

 (ii) Execution
of Supplemental Instruments . On or before the date the Partnership Unit Change Event becomes effective, the Company and, if applicable,

shares of Common Stock (or the combined voting power of the securities of the Parent) beneficially owned by the Holder, its Affiliates
and any other Persons whose beneficial ownership of Common Stock would be aggregated with the Holder s for purposes of Section 13(d)

to the Exercise Transactions unless such party consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, grants the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such discussions. In furtherance of this Section 8(a) ,

of the A R LPA. 

 (i) Subject
to Sections 8(b)(ii) and 8(b)(iii) , each Holder, in its capacity as a holder of Partnership Units following the exercise
of any Warrants, shall have the right (the Exchange Right to require the Company to redeem on a Specified
Exchange Date all or a portion of the Partnership Units held by such Holder at an exchange price equal to and in the form of the Cash
Amount to be paid by the Company. The Exchange Right shall be exercised pursuant to the delivery of an Exchange Notice to the Company
(with a copy to the General Partner) by the Holder who is exercising the Exchange Right (the Exchanging Holder );
 provided , however , that the Company shall not be obligated to satisfy such Exchange Right if the General Partner elects
to purchase the Partnership Units subject to the Exchange Notice pursuant to Section 8(b)(ii) . A Holder may not exercise the
Exchange Right for less than 1,000 Partnership Units or, if such Holder holds less than 1,000 Partnership Units, all of the Partnership
Units held by such Holder. The Exchanging Holder shall have no right, with respect to any Partnership Units so exchanged, to receive any
distribution paid with respect to such Partnership Units if the record date for such distribution is on or after the Specified Exchange
Date, except as provided in Section 8(b)(v) . 

 (ii) Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 8(b)(i) , a Holder that exercises the Exchange Right shall be deemed to have also offered to sell
the Partnership Units described in the Exchange Notice to the General Partner, and the General Partner may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
elect to purchase directly and acquire such Partnership Units by paying to the Exchanging Partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Shares
Amount, as elected by the General Partner (in its sole and absolute discretion), on the Specified Exchange Date, whereupon the General
Partner shall acquire the Partnership Units offered for exchange by the Exchanging Holder and shall be treated for all purposes of the
A R LPA as the owner of such Partnership Units; 

31 

provided , however , that the General
Partner s right to elect to deliver the REIT Shares Amount shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 5(g)(i),
5(g)(ii) , 8(b)(iii) and 8(b)(vi) . If the General Partner shall elect to exercise its right to purchase Partnership Units
under this Section 8(b)(ii) with respect to an Exchange Notice, it shall so notify the Exchanging Holder within one (1) Business
Day after the receipt by the General Partner of such Exchange Notice. Unless the General Partner (in its sole and absolute discretion)
shall exercise its right to purchase Partnership Units from the Exchanging Holder pursuant to this Section 8(b)(ii) , the General
Partner shall have no obligation to the Exchanging Holder or the Company with respect to the Exchanging Holder s exercise of an
Exchange Right. In the event the General Partner shall exercise its right to purchase Partnership Units with respect to the exercise of
an Exchange Right in the manner described in the first sentence of this Section 8(b)(ii) , the Company shall have no obligation
to pay any amount to the Exchanging Holder with respect to such Exchanging Holder s exercise of such Exchange Right, and each of
the Exchanging Holder and the General Partner shall treat the transaction between the General Partner and the Exchanging Holder for federal
income tax purposes as a sale of the Exchanging Holder s Partnership Units to the General Partner. 

 (iii) Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 8(b)(i) and Section 8(b)(ii) , a Holder shall not be entitled to exercise the Exchange
Right if the delivery of Common Stock to such Holder on the Specified Exchange Date by the General Partner pursuant to Section 8(b)(ii) 
(regardless of whether or not the General Partner would in fact exercise its rights under to Section 8(b)(ii) would (a) result
in such Holder or any other Person owning, directly or indirectly, shares of Common Stock in excess of the ownership limitations described
in the Articles of Incorporation (the Ownership Limits and calculated in accordance therewith, taking into
account any Excepted Holder Limit of such Holder or other Person, (b) result in the General Partner being closely held within
the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code, or (c) cause the acquisition of Common Stock by such Holder to be integrated 
with any other distribution of Common Stock for purposes of complying with the registration provisions of the Securities Act. The General
Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, may waive any of the restrictions on exchange set forth in this Section 8(b)(iii) . 

 (iv) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, a Holder shall be entitled to deliver an Exchange Notice concurrently with such
Holder s delivery of an Exercise Notice, in each case, covering the same (or in the case of the Exchange Notice, less) Exercise
Units to be received upon the exercise of the Warrants, in which such case, the Company and the General Partner shall use reasonable best
efforts to combine the procedures for exercise of the Warrants and the exchange of the Exercise Units pursuant to the Exchange Right so
as to eliminate any delays between the exercise of the Warrants and the subsequent exchange of the Exercise Units pursuant to this Section 8(b) ,
including by delivering shares of Common Stock without any legends regarding resale restrictions if such shares of Common Stock are being
sold by the Exchanging Holder pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. 

 (v) If
on or prior to the Specified Exchange Date (i) the Company fails to deliver the Cash Amount or (ii) the General Partner elects to exercise
its purchase right under Section 8(b)(ii) and thereafter fails to deliver the applicable Cash Amount or the REIT Shares Amount,
as applicable, then the Company or the General Partner, respectively, shall pay the Exchanging Holder interest in an amount equal to 10.0 
per annum of the Cash Amount that would have been payable upon exchange of such Partnership Units (regardless of whether such exchange
was to be satisfied by delivery of the applicable Cash Amount or the REIT Shares Amount) for the period beginning on the date the applicable
Exchange Notice until such exchange is satisfied in full by delivery of the applicable Cash Amount or the REIT Shares Amount (together
with any such accrued interest). 

32 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
an Exchanging Holder shall continue to be treated as the Holder of such Partnership Units in all respects during the pendency of any period
of non-payment contemplated in this Section 8(b)(v) . 

 (vi) In
the event that any Holder notifies the Company that it intends to exercise its Exchange Right and the General Partner elects to deliver
the REIT Shares Amount to such Holder, then the General Partner shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly provide an Excepted Holder
Limit to the Holder and one or more of its direct or indirect owners or affiliated entities (collectively, the Holder Group ),
which shall permit them to Beneficially Own (as defined in the Articles of Incorporation) and Constructively Own (as defined in the Articles
of Incorporation) the REIT Shares Amount that could be issued upon the exercise of the Exchange Right with respect to all Partnership
Units that have been or could be issued upon exercise of the Warrants (assuming the Exchange Right could be exercised in full) (such shares,
the Maximum Share Amount ). As a condition to granting such Excepted Holder Limit, such Holder (and/or one
or more of its Affiliates, as appropriate) will provide the General Partner with customary representations (a Representation
Letter reasonably acceptable to the General Partner and such Holder on behalf of the members of the Holder Group, provided 
that such Representation Letter and Excepted Holder Limit shall provide that the members of the Holder Group may own up to 9.9 of any
tenant of the General Partner (as determined for purposes of Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code) (provided that such ownership by members
of the Holder Group does not otherwise cause the General Partner to receive or accrue rent from any tenant described in Section 856(d)(2)(B)
of the Code in an amount that would cause the General Partner to not qualify as a REIT) and, so long as rent from any such tenants, in
the aggregate, does not exceed one percent (1 of the General Partner s gross income in a taxable year, 10 or more of one or more
tenants of the General Partner (as determined for purposes of Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code). Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the General Partner and the Holder are unable to agree on the terms of the Excepted
Holder Limit or an Excepted Holder Limit is not otherwise issued, the General Partner shall not be entitled to elect to deliver the REIT
Shares Amount in exchange for such Partnership Units without the prior written consent of the Holder, unless the members of the Holder
Group would not Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Common Stock in excess of the Ownership Limits in the event that all Partnership
Units that have been or could be issued upon exercise of the Warrants then owned by such members were exchanged for the REIT Shares Amount.
Any terms used in this Section 8(b)(vi) and Section 8(f) and not defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning given
in the Articles of Incorporation. 

 (vii) In
addition to the foregoing, each Holder shall have the right (the Warrant Exchange Right to require the Company
to redeem all or a portion of the Warrants held by such Holder. Such Warrant Exchange Right shall be effected as though such Warrants
had been exercised for Partnership Units and, concurrently therewith, such Partnership Units were submitted for redemption pursuant to
the terms of Sections 8(b)(i) through (v) , which shall apply mutatis mutandis to such Warrant Exchange Right,
including with respect to the procedures for delivery of an Exchange Notice in respect of such Warrants, the amount and form of the exchange
price being based on the Cash Amount for such Warrants, and the right of the General Partner to purchase directly and acquire such Warrants
by paying to the Exchanging Partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Shares Amount, as elected by the General Partner (in its sole and
absolute discretion, subject to Section 8(b)(ii) ). 

 (c) No Adverse Amendments .
The Company shall not amend, alter, waive or repeal any provision (including by merger, consolidation, division, transfer or
conveyance of all or substantially all of its assets or otherwise) of the A R LPA, Certificate of Designations, or any similar
organizational documents of the Company or any Subsidiary, if such amendment, alteration, waiver or repeal would adversely affect the
rights, of any Holder.

Holder may irrevocably elect to purchase New Securities on the terms set forth in the Offer Notice by delivering a written notice to the
Parent or the Company, as applicable, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Offer Notice (or such longer period as the Parent
or the Company may specify therein) setting forth the amount of New Securities that the Holder desires to purchase (a Purchase
Notice ). If at least one Holder delivers a Purchase Notice for its full Pro Rata Percentage (a Fully Subscribing
Holder ), but one or more other Holders does not deliver a Purchase Notice for its full Pro Rata Percentage (an Undersubscribing
Holder ), then the Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall offer to the Fully Subscribing Holder such portion of the
New Securities eligible to be purchased by the Undersubscribing Holders that such Investor Parties did not elect to purchase (the Undersubscribed
New Securities ). Each Fully Holder may offer to purchase up to the full amount of Undersubscribed New Securities and to
the extent more than one Fully Subscribing Holders offers to purchase Undersubscribed New Securities, such Undersubscribed New Securities
shall be allocated ratably based on such Fully Subscribing Holder s Pro Rata Percentage. 

 (iii) In
the event a Holder timely delivers a Purchase Notice, then the sale of New Securities set forth in the Purchase Notice delivered by the
Holder shall take place no later than sixty (60) days after the date of the Offer Notice and concurrent with the issuance of New Securities

the Holder shall be no greater than the number of New Securities described in the Offer Notice minus the number of New Securities
elected to be purchased by the Holders in the related Purchase Notice. In the event that no Holders timely deliver a Purchase Notice,
then the Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to sell no later than sixty (60) days
after the date of the Offer Notice up to the number of New Securities described in the Offer Notice. If the New Securities are not sold
during such period, the rights of the Holders under this Section 8(d) shall apply to any such proposed sale and the Parent
or the Company, as applicable, shall provide a new Offer Notice. 

 (iv) New
Securities issued hereunder to each Holder shall be on the terms set forth in the related Offer Notice, and New Securities issued to any
other Person(s) shall be at a price and on other terms and conditions not more favorable to such Person(s) than those offered to the Holders
in the related Offer Notice. 

 (v) Each
Holder may assign, in whole or in part, their right to purchase New Securities pursuant to this Section 8(d) to any Affiliate
and, upon such assignment, such Person shall be entitled to exercise the rights of the Holder under this Section 8(d) . 

34 

(vi) The
rights of any Holder under this Section 8(d) shall not apply to Preemptive Securities issued pursuant to an Exempt Issuance. 

 (vii) If,
as a result of the exercise of a right pursuant to this Section 8(d) , one or more Holders notify the Parent or the Company,
as applicable, within five (5) business days of their exercise of such right that such Holder reasonably believes a Regulatory Approval
Condition may apply, then such Holder and the Parent or the Company shall cooperate in accordance with the provisions of Section 8(a) 
(where references to the Company shall be to the Parent in connection with the offer of New Securities by the Parent) in respect of the
Holder s exercise of a right pursuant to this Section 8(d) , mutatis mutandis . The costs and expenses of all activities

be registered pursuant to the Securities Act to be sold in a transaction in which the Parent has engaged one or more underwriter(s), the
Parent will (i) give each Holder advance notice of such proposed issuance as promptly as is reasonably practical and prudent in light
of the timing and nature of the transaction, but no less than five (5) Business Days before the public announcement of such transaction
and (ii) cause the underwriters to allow each Holder to participate in such proposed issuance in an amount up to the Holder s Pro
Rata Percentage (and giving effect to the over- and under-subscription provisions of Section 8(d)(ii) on the same terms,
conditions and price to be provided to other investors in the proposed issuance of New Securities, subject to the Holder s compliance
with any timing, indication, eligibility and documentation requirements imposed by any underwriter on similarly situated participants
in the transaction. 

 (ix) Notwithstanding
any provision hereof to the contrary, in lieu of complying with the provisions of Section 8(d)(i) , the Company may elect to
give notice to the Holders within twenty (20) days after the issuance of Preemptive Securities for an amount in excess of 10 million
(as aggregated with all issuances of Preemptive Securities since the last Offer Notice was delivered to the Holders), which notice shall
describe the type, price and terms of the Preemptive Securities. Each Holder shall have thirty (30) days from the date such notice is
given to elect to purchase up to the number of Preemptive Securities that it would have been entitled to purchase under this Section 8(d) 
had Section 8(d)(i) been complied with on and before the issuance of such Preemptive Securities, and the provisions of Section 8(d) 
shall apply mutatis mutandis . 

 (e) Certain Tax Matters . Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the General Partner shall place appropriate restrictions on the ability of the Limited Partners of the
Company to exercise their Exchange Rights as and if deemed necessary to ensure that the Company does not constitute a publicly
traded partnership under Section 7704 of the Code. If and when the General Partner determines that imposing such restrictions
is necessary, the General Partner shall give prompt written notice thereof to each of the Limited Partners and take such other actions
as may be necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as long as the Warrants remain outstanding
or the Exercise Units have not been redeemed or exchanged pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the General Partner shall cause the
Company not to have more than fifty (50) partners within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)
and as calculated without regard to the Warrants and the Exercise Units. 

 (f) Ownership Limits . So long
as any Warrants or Exercise Units are outstanding and are directly or indirectly beneficially owned by the initial Holder or any of its
Affiliates, the General Partner shall not decrease the Ownership Limits unless it concurrently grants an Excepted Holder Limit that permits
the initial Holder and such Affiliates (together with certain affiliated persons) to Beneficially Own and Constructively Own at least
9.8 (in both value and in number of shares) of the outstanding shares of

Indemnified Party as a result of the Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party
or Indemnifying Parties, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or
omissions that resulted in the Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party

things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or related to information supplied by, the Indemnifying Party or Indemnifying Parties or
the Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such action, statement or omission. 

 (b) The
parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6.4 were determined
by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred
to in the immediately preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.4 to the contrary, an Indemnifying
Party that is a selling Holder will not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total net proceeds (after
any discounts, commissions, transfer taxes, fees and expenses) received by such Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities exceeds
the amount of any damages which such selling Holder has, in the aggregate, otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)
of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

been contained herein.

provided by reason of any default of Contributor or any Company Subsidiary, and if such default is not cured within three (3) days of
written notice thereof from the Company to Contributor, the Company may, as its sole and exclusive remedy, either: (a) terminate this
Agreement, in which event the Company will receive from the Escrow Agent the Deposit (less the Independent Consideration), Contributor
shall promptly reimburse the Company and Investor for the actual out-of-pocket third party costs that the Company or Investor have incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, Contributor shall pay the Break-Up Fee to the Company within three (3) Business
Days of termination of this Agreement, and the Company and Investor will have no further rights or obligations under this Agreement, except
with respect to the Termination Surviving Obligations; or (b) pursue specific performance of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that it shall not be a default by Contributor hereunder (and Contributor shall not be responsible for
payment of the Break-Up Fee) if Contributor is unable to obtain the Assumed Debt Amendment or the New Debt as of the Closing Date by reason
of a Material Adverse Event. If, in breach of this Agreement, Contributor intentionally or willfully defaults by selling or entering into
a binding agreement to otherwise convey or cause to be conveyed the Membership Interests or any Property (or any portion thereof or interest
therein) to someone other than the Company which renders the remedy of specific performance impossible or impractical to obtain, in addition
to the remedies set forth above, Contributor shall be liable for any damages suffered by the Company as a result of such breach, including
the positive difference, if any, between the Investor Cash Contribution and the sale price paid to Contributor or any Affiliate thereof
by such third party. 

 11.2 
 Default by Company . If after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the Company s obligation to purchase the
Membership Interests in accordance with this Agreement, the Company defaults in its obligation to close the Transactions and if such default
is not cured within three (3) days from written notice thereof from Contributor to the Company, Contributor may, as Contributor s
sole and exclusive remedy at law and in equity, terminate this Agreement and receive the Deposit as liquidated damages, and thereafter,
the parties shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder, except with respect to the Termination Surviving Obligations. The Company
and Contributor hereby agree that actual damages would be difficult or impossible to ascertain and such amount is a reasonable estimate
of the damages for such breach.

Limited Liability Company Interest Contribution Agreement 

LIMITED JOINDER 

 Executed for the sole purpose of
agreeing to guarantee the obligations of Contributor pursuant to Article 5, Article 11 and Section 12.10 of the foregoing Agreement (the
 Guaranteed Obligations ). 

 Plymouth Industrial REIT, Inc.,
a Maryland corporation (the Guarantor ), acknowledges that Guarantor is an Affiliate of Contributor and will
derive substantial benefits by reason of the Contributor s performance of its obligations hereunder and that the Parties 
agreement to enter into this Agreement is subject to Guarantor s agreement to guarantee the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.
For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Guarantor hereby guarantees to the
Investor and the Company the complete and timely payment of the Guaranteed Obligations. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Guarantor
waives diligence, protest, notice of protest, presentment, demand of payment, notice of dishonor and all other suretyship defenses. 

 WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY
OF THE FOREGOING, TO THE EXTENT THAT GUARANTOR IS DEEMED TO BE A GUARANTOR OR SURETY OF CONTRIBUTOR, THEN THE WAIVERS SET FORTH BELOW
SHALL APPLY. 

 Guarantor expressly acknowledges
that it could, in the absence of the waivers and agreements set forth herein, have one or more defenses to or otherwise be exonerated
from the obligations set forth herein as a result of any such election of remedies by the Company and/or Investor, and Guarantor hereby
knowingly, expressly and irrevocably waives each and every such defense to its liability hereunder, and expressly acknowledges the reliance
hereon of the Company and/or Investor. Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the financial condition
of the other and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance of the obligations set forth herein
which diligent inquiry would reveal, and agrees that neither the Company nor Investor shall have no duty to advise Guarantor of information
known to the Company or Investor, as applicable, regarding such condition or any such circumstances. Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any and all rights of subrogation, indemnity, contribution or reimbursement, and any and all benefits of and rights to enforce
any power, right or remedy that the Company and/or Investor may now or hereafter have in respect of the obligations set forth herein against
any other obligor upon any of the obligations covered herein, any and all benefits of and rights to participate in any collateral, whether
real or personal property, now or hereafter held by the Company and/or Investor, and any and all other rights and claims (as defined in
any federal or state bankruptcy code) Guarantor has upon or in respect of the obligations set forth herein, under applicable Requirements
of Law or otherwise, at law or in equity, by reason hereof, unless and until the obligations set forth herein shall have been indefeasibly
paid and performed in full. 

 Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Guarantor hereby waives: (a) any defense based upon any legal disability or other defense of any other person, or by
reason of the cessation or limitation of the liability of any other person from any cause; (b) any defense based upon any lack of authority
of the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on behalf of Guarantor or any Affiliate or Contributor or any
defect in the formation of Contributor or any Affiliate of Contributor; (c) any defense based upon the application by Guarantor of funds
for 

Joinder 

purposes other than the purposes represented by Guarantor
or intended or understood by Guarantor; (d) any and all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Company and/or
Investor, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation,
has destroyed Guarantor s rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any other person; (e) any defense based upon the Company s
and/or Investor s failure to disclose to Guarantor any information concerning Contributor s or the Company s financial
condition or any other circumstances bearing on Contributor s ability to pay all sums payable by it to the Company and/or Investor;
(f) any defense based upon the Company s and/or Investor s election, in any proceeding instituted under any federal or state
bankruptcy code, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the federal bankruptcy code or any successor statute; (g) any defense
based upon any borrowing or any grant of a security interest under Section 364 of the federal bankruptcy code; (h) until Guarantor s
obligations hereunder are performed in full, any right of subrogation, any right to enforce any remedy which the Company and/or Investor
may have against any Person, including Contributor, and any right to participate in, or benefit from, any security now or hereafter held
by the Company and/or Investor; (i) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must
be neither larger in amount nor in any other respects more burdensome than that of a principal; and (j) presentment, demand, protest and
notice of any kind. Guarantor further waives any and all rights and defenses that Guarantor may have because Contributor s obligations
may, in the future, be secured by real property; this means, among other things, that: (i) the Company and/or Investor may collect from
Guarantor without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by Contributor; (ii) if the Company and/or Investor
forecloses on any real property collateral pledged by Contributor, then (A) the amount of the debt may be reduced only by the price for
which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (B) the Company and/or
Investor may collect from Guarantor even if the Company and/or Investor, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed
any right Guarantor may have to collect from Contributor. The foregoing sentences are an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights
and defenses Guarantor may have because Contributor s debt may be or may in the future be secured by real property. Without limitation,
Guarantor shall not exercise any voting rights, shall file any claim nor participate or appear in any bankruptcy or insolvency case involving
the other with respect to the obligations set forth herein whether or not such obligations shall have been paid and performed in full. 

 Investor is a third party beneficiary
of the Guaranteed Obligations. If Company does not enforce the Guaranteed Obligations, or this guaranty, then Investor may, in its own
name, or in the name of the Company, or both, bring one or more actions to enforce the Guaranteed Obligations, or this guaranty.
