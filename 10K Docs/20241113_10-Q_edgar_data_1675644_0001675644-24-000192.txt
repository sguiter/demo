 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, collateral adequacy, credit documentation, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis typically includes larger, non-homogeneous loans such as commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. This analysis is performed on an ongoing basis as new information is obtained. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 Pass Loans listed as pass include larger non-homogeneous loans not meeting the risk rating definitions below and smaller, homogeneous loans not assessed on an individual basis. 
 Special Mention Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 
 Substandard Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the enhanced possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 Doubtful Loans classified as doubtful include those loans which have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently known facts, conditions and values, improbable. 
 Loss Loans classified as loss include those loans which are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as loans is not warranted. Even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future, it is neither practical nor desirable to defer writing off these loans.

 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, collateral adequacy, credit documentation, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes larger non-homogeneous loans such as commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. This analysis is performed on an ongoing basis as new information is obtained. At September 30, 2024, the Company had million in loans identified as special mention, an increase from million at December 31, 2023. Special mention rated loans are loans that have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention, however, the borrower continues to pay in accordance with their contract. Loans rated as special mention do not have a specific reserve and are considered well-secured. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had million in loans identified as substandard, a decrease of million from December 31, 2023. Substandard rated loans are loans that are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard loans are individually evaluated, typically on the basis of the underlying collateral. At September 30, 2024, an individually assessed allowance for credit losses totaling thousand has been estimated to supplement any shortfall of collateral.

 Modifications with Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty

A variety of solutions are offered to borrowers, including loan modifications that may result in principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, repayment plans or combinations thereof.

 Interest Rate Risk Management Cash Flow Hedging Instruments 
 The Company uses wholesale funding (in the form of FHLB advances and brokered certificates of deposit) from time to time as a source of funds for use in the Company's lending and investment activities and other general business purposes. This wholesale funding exposes the Company to increased interest rate risk as a result of the variability in cash flows (future interest payments). The Company believes it is prudent to reduce this interest rate risk. To meet this objective, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby the Company reduces the interest rate risk associated with the Company's variable rate wholesale funding from the designation date and going through the maturity date. 
 Weighted average pay rate Weighted average receive rate Weighted average maturity in years years years Unrealized gain relating to interest rate swaps 
 These agreements provided for the Company to receive payments determined by a specific index in exchange for making payments at a fixed rate. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unrealized gain or loss relating to interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments of the variability of cash flows associated with wholesale funding are reported in other comprehensive income (loss). These amounts are subsequently reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period in which the related interest on wholesale funding affects earnings. The Company measures cash flow hedging relationships for effectiveness on a monthly basis, and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the hedges were highly effective and the amount of ineffectiveness reflected in earnings was de minimus.

 Unused commitments to fund loans and lines of credit Commercial and standby letters of credit 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company, is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. 
 Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit usually do not contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company, is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. 
 Commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. Substantially all letters of credit issued have expiration dates within year. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company generally holds collateral supporting those commitments, if deemed necessary. 
 The Company enters into rate lock commitments to finance residential mortgage loans with its customers. These commitments offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by the Company. 
 The Company maintains its cash accounts with the Federal Reserve Board of Richmond ("FRB") and correspondent banks.

 Certain financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets usually result from the application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 
 The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain financial assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the financial statements: 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 all of the Company's individually evaluated loans were evaluated based upon the fair value of the collateral. In accordance with ASC 820, individually evaluated loans where an allowance is established based on the the fair value of collateral (i.e., those loans that are collateral dependent) require classification in the fair value hierarchy. Fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing the loans. Collateral may be in the form of real estate or business assets including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable. The vast majority of the collateral is real estate. The value of real estate collateral is determined utilizing a market valuation approach based on an appraisal conducted by an independent, licensed appraiser outside of the Company using observable market data (Level 2). However, if the collateral is a house or building in the process of construction, has the value derived by discounting comparable sales due to lack of similar properties, or is discounted by the Company due to marketability, then the fair value is considered Level 3. The value of business equipment is based upon an outside appraisal if deemed significant, or the net book value on the applicable business s financial statements if not considered significant using observable market data. Likewise, values for inventory and accounts receivables collateral are based on financial statement balances or aging reports (Level 3). Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

 Contract Balances 
 A contract asset balance occurs when an entity performs a service for a customer before the customer pays consideration (resulting in a contract receivable) or before payment is due (resulting in a contract asset). A contract liability balance is an entity s obligation to transfer a service to a customer for which the entity has already received payment (or payment is due) from the customer. The Company s noninterest revenue streams are largely based on transactional activity. Consideration is often received immediately or shortly after the Company satisfies its performance obligation and revenue is recognized. The Company does not typically enter into long-term revenue contracts with customers, and therefore, does not experience significant contract balances. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any significant contract balances. 
 Contract Acquisition Costs 
 Under Topic 606, an entity is required to capitalize, and subsequently amortize into expense, certain incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if these costs are expected to be recovered. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that an entity incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained (for example, sales commission). The Company utilizes the practical expedient which allows entities to immediately expense contract acquisition costs when the asset that would have resulted from capitalizing these costs would have been amortized in one year or less. The Company did not capitalize any contract acquisition costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.

 Overview 
 We are a bank holding company headquartered in Fairfax County, Virginia. Our sole subsidiary, FVCbank (the "Bank"), was formed in November 2007 as a community-oriented, locally-owned and managed commercial bank under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Bank offers a wide range of traditional bank loan and deposit products and services to both our commercial and retail customers. Our commercial relationship officers focus on attracting small and medium sized businesses, commercial real estate developers and builders, including government contractors, non-profit organizations, and professionals. Our approach to our market features competitive customized financial services offered to customers and prospects in a personal relationship context by seasoned professionals. 
 On August 31, 2021, we announced that the Bank made an investment in Atlantic Coast Mortgage, LLC ("ACM") for 20.4 million to obtain a 28.7 ownership interest in ACM. The Bank provides a warehouse lending facility to ACM, which includes a construction-to-permanent financing line, and has developed portfolio mortgage products to diversify our held for investment loan portfolio. 
 On December 15, 2022, the Company announced that the Board of Directors approved a five-for-four split of the Company's common stock in the form of a 25 stock dividend for shareholders of record on January 9, 2023, payable on January 31, 2023. Earnings per share and all other per share information reflected herein have been adjusted for the five-for-four split of the Company's common stock for comparative purposes. 
 Net interest income is our primary source of revenue. We define revenue as net interest income plus noninterest income. We manage our balance sheet and interest rate risk exposure to maximize, and concurrently stabilize, net interest income. We do this by monitoring our liquidity position and the spread between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. We attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk, but are unable to eliminate it entirely. In addition to managing interest rate risk, we also analyze our loan portfolio for exposure to credit risk. Loan defaults and foreclosures are inherent risks in the banking industry, and we attempt to limit our exposure to these risks by carefully underwriting and then monitoring our extensions of credit. In addition to net interest income, noninterest income is a complementary source of revenue for us and includes, among other things, service charges on deposits and loans, income from minority membership interest in ACM, merchant services fee income, insurance commission income, income from bank owned life insurance ("BOLI"), and gains and losses on sales of investment securities available-for-sale.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 General 
 The accounting principles we apply under U.S generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting, reporting and disclosure matters. Management must use assumptions, judgments and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical. These policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments, assumptions and estimates. Changes in such judgments, assumptions and estimates may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Actual results, in fact, could differ from initial estimates. 
 The accounting policies we view as critical are those relating to judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding the determination of the allowance for credit losses - loans reserve for unfunded commitments, and fair value measurements. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans Unfunded Commitments 
 We maintain the allowance for credit losses ("ACL") at a level that represents management s best estimate of expected losses in our loan portfolio. We adopted the provisions of the current expected credit losses ("CECL") accounting standard as of January 1, 2023 in accordance with the required implementation date and recorded the impact of the adoption to retained earnings, net of deferred income taxes, as required by the standard. Prior to the adoption of CECL, we utilized an incurred loss model to derive our best estimate of the ACL. 
 Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 326 requires that an estimate of CECL be immediately recognized and reevaluated over the contractual life of the financial asset. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged off against the ACL when they are deemed uncollectible. Expected recoveries are recorded to the extent they do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously and expected to be charged-off. 
 Reserves on loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Nonaccrual loans are specifically reviewed for loss potential and when deemed appropriate are assigned a reserve based on an individual evaluation. The remainder of the portfolio, representing all loans not evaluated individually for impairment, is segmented based on call report code and processed through a cash flow valuation model. In particular, loan-level probability of default ("PD") and severity (also referred to as loss given default ("LGD")) is applied to derive a baseline expected loss as of the valuation date. These expected default and severity rates, which are regression-derived and based on peer historical loan-level performance data, are calibrated to incorporate our reasonable and supportable forecast of future losses as well as any necessary qualitative adjustments. 
 
 Typically, financial institutions use their historical loss experience and trends in losses for each loan segment which are then adjusted for portfolio trends and economic and environmental factors in determining the ACL. Since the Bank s inception in 2007, we have experienced minimal loss history within our loan portfolio. Due to the fact that limited internal loss history exists to generate statistical significance, we determined it was most prudent to rely on peer data when deriving our best estimate of PD and LGD. As part of our estimation process, we will continue to assess the reasonableness of the data, assumptions, and model methodology utilized to derive our allowance for credit losses. 
 For each of the modeled loan segments, we generate cash flow projections at the instrument level wherein payment expectations are adjusted for estimated prepayment speeds, PD rates, and LGD rates. The modeling of expected prepayment speeds is based on internal loan-level historical data. For our cash flow model, we utilize national unemployment for reasonable and supportable forecasting of expected default. To further adjust the ACL for expected losses not already within the quantitative component of the calculation, we may consider qualitative factors as prescribed in ASC 326. 
 
 Financial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit issued to meet customer financing needs. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for off-balance sheet loan commitments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. We record a reserve for unfunded commitments on off-balance sheet credit exposures through a charge to provision for credit loss expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income. The reserve for unfunded commitments is estimated by call report code segmentation as of the valuation date under the CECL model using the same methodologies as portfolio loans taking utilization rates into consideration. The reserve for unfunded commitments is reflected as a liability on our Consolidated Statement of Condition. 
 39 

While our methodology in establishing the ACL attributes portions of a combined reserve to multiple elements, we believe that the combined allowance for credit losses (which is inclusive of the reserve for unfunded commitments) represents the most appropriate coverage metric for loss absorption purposes. 
 
 Our methodology utilized in the estimation of the ACL, which is performed at least quarterly, is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in our loan portfolio credit quality, composition, and forecasted economic conditions. The review of the reasonableness and appropriateness of the ACL is reviewed by the ACL Committee for approval as of the valuation date. Additionally, information is provided to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis along with our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Credit losses are an inherent part of our business and, although we believe the methodologies for determining the ACL and the current level of the allowance and reserve on unfunded commitments are appropriate, it is possible that there may be unidentified losses in the portfolio at any particular time that may become evident at a future date pursuant to additional internal analysis or regulatory comment. Additional provisions for such losses, if necessary, would be recorded, and would negatively impact earnings. 
 
 Collateral Dependent Financial Assets 
 Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. For collateral dependent financial assets where we have determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and we expect repayment of the financial asset to be provided substantially through the sale of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the asset as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the financial asset exceeds the net present value from the operation of the collateral. When repayment is expected to be from the sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the financial asset exceeds the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated cost to sell. The ACL may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses - Securities 
 We evaluate our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities portfolios for expected credit losses as of the valuation date under ASC 326. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether we intend to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis. If either criterion is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income during the current period. For available-for-sale debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other driving factors. If our assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, an ACL is recorded for the credit loss (which represents the difference between the expected cash flows and amortized cost basis), limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 The entire amount of an impairment loss is recognized in earnings only when: (1) we intend to sell the security; or (2) it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis; or (3) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. In all other situations, only the portion of the impairment loss representing the credit loss must be recognized in earnings, with the remaining portion being recognized in shareholders' equity as comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes. 
 
 Changes in the ACL are recorded as a provision for (or reversal of) credit losses. Losses are charged against the ACL when we believe the uncollectibility of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. Any impairment not recorded through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income as a noncredit-related impairment. 
 
 As part of our estimation process, we have made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis of available-for-sale debt securities and report accrued interest separately in other assets in the Consolidated Statement of Condition. Available-for-sale debt securities are placed on nonaccrual status when we no longer expect to receive all contractual amounts due, which is generally at 90 days past due. Accrued interest receivable is reversed against interest income when a security is placed on nonaccrual status. Accordingly, we do not recognize an ACL against accrued interest receivable. This approach is consistent with our nonaccrual policy implemented for our loan portfolio. 
 40 

We separately evaluate our held-to-maturity investment securities for any credit losses. If we determine that a security indicates evidence of deteriorated credit quality, the security is individually-evaluated and a discounted cash flow analysis is performed and compared to the amortized cost basis. As of September 30, 2024, we had one security c lassified as held-to-maturity with an amortized cost basi s of 265 thousand with the remainder of the securities portfolio held as available-for-sale. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 We determine the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Our investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using reliable and unbiased evaluations by an industry-wide valuation service. This service uses evaluated pricing models that vary based on asset class and include available trade, bid, and other market information. Generally, the methodology includes broker quotes, proprietary models, vast descriptive terms and conditions databases, as well as extensive quality control programs. Depending on the availability of observable inputs and prices, different valuation models could produce materially different fair value estimates. The values presented may not represent future fair values and may not be realizable. 

Results of Operations Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Overview 
 We recorded ne t income of 4.7 million, or 0.25 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 4.0 million, or 0.22 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 630 thousand, or 16 . Net interest incom e increased 878 thousand, or 7 , to 14.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 13.3 million for the same period of 2023. We released provisioning for credit losses totaling 200 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a release of reserves for credit losses totaling 729 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest income wa s 815 thousand and 225 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Noninterest expense was 9.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a increase of 147 thousand, or 2 . 
 The annualized return on average assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.85 and 0.70 , respectively. The annualized return on average equity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 8.15 and 7.57 , respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net income of 10.2 million, or 0.55 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of 8.9 million, or 0.49 diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes the surrender of certain BOLI policies with an aggregate cash surrender value of 48.0 million. Upon the surrender, we received a cash payout and were required to accrue additional income tax on the appreciation of those policies which had previously been treated as tax-exempt income. This resulted in additional statutory income tax expense of 1.6 million and tax penalties of 722 thousand. The tax penalties related to the surrender of the BOLI were recorded in income tax expense. A dditionally, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included losses on the sale of available-for-sale investment securities totaling 4.6 million. 
 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 40.7 million, compared to 41.7 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 1.1 million, or 3 . Provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6 thousand, compared to 132 thousand for the same period of 2023. Non-interest income was 2.1 million compared to a loss of 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Noninterest expense was 26.8 million and 27.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 444 thousand, or 2 . 
 Commercial bank operating earnings, which exclude the nonrecurring taxes on the surrender of our BOLI policies recorded during the first quarter of 2024 and the after-tax losses on the sale of investment securities available-for-sale recorded during the first quarter 2023, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 4.7 million and 4.0 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, commercial bank operating earnings were 12.6 million and 12.5 million, respectively. 
 41 

Diluted commercial bank operating earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were each 0.25 and 0.22, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, diluted commercial bank operating earnings per share were 0.68 and 0.69, respectively. 
 We consider commercial bank operating earnings a useful financial measure of our operating performance. Commercial bank operating earnings is determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP can be found in the tables below.

Net interest income totaled 14.2 million, an increase of 878 thousand, or 7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income is primarily a result of an increase in total interest income of 1.8 million, or 7 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Loan interest income increased 2.1 million, or 8 , to 27.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 25.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense increased 926 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. 
 Average earning assets decreased 72.8 million to 2.14 billion during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2.21 billion for the same period of 2023, which was primarily related to the sales of investment securities available-for-sale that were completed during the first and fourth quarters of 2023, decreasing the average balances of our investment securities by 76.4 million. 
 Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.8 million, or 7 , to 29.2 million, from 27.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Loan interest income during the third quarter of 2024 increased 2.1 million, or 8 , as compared to the year ago quarter due to both an increase in loan volume and an increase in yields earned on the loan portfolio. Income from investment securities decreased 258 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales of investment securities executed during 2023. Interest income from deposits at other financial institutions decreased 74 thousand to 802 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, which was primarily due to lower average balances. 
 Average interest-bearing deposits decreased 111.2 million to 1.50 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.61 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease in wholesale deposits. Average wholesale deposits decreased 116.8 million to 249.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 366.7 million for the same period in 2023. Average non-interest-bearing deposits decreased 67.2 million to 358.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 425.8 million for the same period in 2023. Average other borrowed funds, which primarily include federal funds purchased and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ("FHLB"), increased 47.9 million to 57.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 926 thousand to 15.0 million, or 7 , from 14.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Deposit interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 400 thousand compared to the year ago quarter primarily as a result of increased interest rates on interest-bearing deposits. Interest expense on other borrowed funds increased 528 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Our net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.64 and 2.39 , respectively, an increase of 25 basis points, or 10 . The yield on interest-earning assets increased 51 basis points to 5.46 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.95 for the same period of 2023. The average yield of the loan portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5.83 and 5.40 , respectively, an increase of 43 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 37 basis points to 3.77 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.40 for the same period of 2023, which was primarily attributable to the repricing of our interest-bearing deposits due to higher interest rates. Cost of deposits (which includes non-interest-bearing deposits) was 3.04 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.69 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of other borrowed funds increased to 3.93 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.53 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was 40.7 million and 41.7 million, respectively, a decrease of 1.1 million, or 3 . The decrease in net interest income is primarily due to an increase in funding costs, which have increased precipitously as a result of Federal Reserve monetary policy, coupled with the need to meet intense competition from market area banks, brokerages, other financial institutions, and the U.S. Treasury. 
 Average earning assets decreased 91.4 million, to 2.12 billion, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.21 billion for the same period of 2023, which is primarily related to our sales of investment securities available-for-sale completed during 2023. 
 
 Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4.1 million to 84.0 million from 80.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Loan interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5.5 million as compared to the same nine month period of 2023, primarily as a result of the increase in yields earned on the loan portfolio. Income from investment securities decreased 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, primarily as a result of the sales of investment securities executed during 2023. Income from deposits at other financial institutions decreased 447 thousand year-over-year, as excess liquidity was used to fund loan originations and paydown costly wholesale fundings. 
 
 Total average interest-bearing deposits increased 66.5 million to 1.44 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.51 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 61.0 million to 372.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 433.3 million for the same period of 2023. Average wholesale deposits decreased 63.9 million to 268.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 332.2 million for the same period in 2023. Average other borrowed funds, which include federal funds purchased and FHLB advances, decreased 10.3 million to 88.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 98.4 million for the same period of 2023. 
 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5.1 million to 43.4 million from 38.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Deposit interest expense for the year-to-date period of 2024 increased 5.0 million compared to the year ago nine month period primarily as a result of increased interest rates paid on deposits. 
 
 Our net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.57 and 2.53 respectively. The increase in net interest margin is a result of continued improvement in the yields earned on our loan portfolio and our management to control funding costs. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 46 basis points to 5.29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.83 for the same period of 2023. The average yield of the loan portfolio for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5.65 and 5.29 , respectively, an increase of 36 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 60 basis points to 3.67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.07 for the same period of 2023, which was primarily attributable to the repricing of our interest-bearing deposits due to higher interest rates. Cost of deposits (which includes noninterest-bearing deposits) was 2.92 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.38 for the same nine month period of 2023. Cost of other borrowed funds increased 58 basis points to 4.47 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Average balances of nonperforming loans, which include nonaccrual loans, are included in the net interest margin calculation and did not have a material impact on our net interest margin in 2024 and 2023. 
 Provision Expense and Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Our policy is to maintain the ACL at a level that represents our best estimate of expected losses in the loan portfolio as of the valuation date. Both the amount of the provision and the level of the allowance for credit losses are impacted by many factors, including general and industry-specific economic conditions, actual and expected credit losses, historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers. 
 We recorded a release of provision for credit losses totaling 200 thousand and 729 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, provision for credit losses totaled 6 thousand and 132 thousand, respectively. The allowance for credit losses was 19.1 million and 18.9 million at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023, respectively. Our allowance for credit losses on loans as a percent of total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, was 1.02 and 1.03 at September 30, 2024 an d December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 49 

We lend to well-established and relationship-driven borrowers which has contributed to our track record of low historical credit losses. We continue to maintain our disciplined credit guidelines during the current rate environment. We proactively monitor the impact of interest rates on our adjustable loans as the industry navigates through this economic cycle of increased inflation and higher interest rates. Nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024 totale d 3.6 million, or 0.16 of total assets, compared to 1.8 million, or 0.08 , of total assets at December 31, 2023. We had no other real estate owned at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. We recorded net recoveries of 63 thousand during the third quarter of 2024 compared to net recoveries of 7 thousand for same period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded net recoveries of 98 thousand and net charge-offs of 326 thousand, respectively.

 Salaries and benefits expense decreased 415 thousand to 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.3 million for the same period in 2023, a result of reduced staffing through process improvement resulting from the use of improved technologies. Occupancy expense decreased by 82 thousand, primarily as a result of the office space reduction efforts that were completed during the fourth quarter of 2023. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in internet banking and software expense of 46 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 706 thousand, as compared to 660 thousand for the same period in 2023, a result of the implementation of enhanced customer software solutions.

decreased by 283 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023, which was primarily related to the office space reduction initiatives that were completed during the fourth quarter of 2023. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in internet banking and software expense of 326 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 2.1 million, compared to 1.8 million for the same period in 2023, a result of the implementation of enhanced customer software solutions during 2023.

The Bank had FHLB advances outstanding of 50.0 million a nd 85.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Subordinated debt, net of unamortized issuance costs, totaled 19.7 million and 19.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Loans Receivable, Net 
 Loans receivable, net of deferred fees, were 1.87 billion at September 30, 2024 and 1.83 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 46.4 million, or 3 . During the third quarter of 2024, loan originations totaled 58.7 million with a weighted average rate of 9.27 , and were primarily comprised of commercial and industrial loans. Loan renewals totaled 60.4 million with a weighted average rate of 8.94 . Loans that paid off during the third quarter of 2024 totaled 51.6 million with a weighted average rate of 7.52 . 
 Commercial real estate loans totaled 1.06 billion and 1.09 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and were approximately 57 and 60 of the total loans receivable at such dates, respectively. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans were 196.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 212.9 million at December 31, 2023. Nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans were 866.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 878.7 million at December 31, 2023. Commercial construction loans totaled 173.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 148.0 million at December 31, 2023 and comprised of 9 and 8 of total loans receivable at such dates, respectively. Our regulatory commercial real estate concentration (which includes nonowner-occupied real estate and construction loans) was 385 of our total risk-based capital at September 30, 2024. Our commercial real estate portfolio, including construction loans, is diversified by asset type and geographic concentration. We manage this portion of our portfolio in a disciplined manner. We have comprehensive policies to monitor, measure, and mitigate our loan concentrations within this portfolio segment, including rigorous credit approval, monitoring and administrative practices. Additional information on the stratification of these portfolio segments can be found below under "Asset Quality". 
 The following table presents the composition of our loans receivable portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Loans Receivable

 Asset Quality 
 Nonperforming loans, defined as nonaccrual loans and loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest and still accruing, were 3.6 million and 1.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, an increase of 1.8 million. Loans that we have classified as nonperforming are a result of customer specific deterioration, mostly financial in nature, that are not a result of economic, industry, or environmental causes that we might see as a pattern for possible future losses within our loan portfolio. For each of our criticized assets, we individually evaluate each loan, generally through the performance of a collateral analysis to determine the amount of allowance required. As a result of the analysis completed, we had specific reserves totaling 802 thousand and 676 thousand at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our ratio of nonperforming loans to total assets was 0.16 and 0.08 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We had no other real estate owned and there wer e no loan modifications for borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 We categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, collateral adequacy, credit documentation, and current economic trends, among other factors. We analyze loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes larger, non-homogeneous loans such as commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. This analysis is performed on an ongoing basis as new information is obtained. At September 30, 2024, we had 15.4 million in loans identified as special mention, an increase of 9.2 million from December 31, 2023. Special mention rated loans have a potential weakness that deserves our close attention; however, the borrower continues to pay in accordance with their contractual terms, unless modified and disclosed. The increase from December 31, 2023 was driven by one loan that was downgraded to special mention during the second quarter of 2024. Loans rated as special mention are generally considered to be well-secured, and are not individually evaluated. 
 At September 30, 2024 , we had 3.2 million in loans identified as substandard, a decrease of 19.4 million from December 31, 2023. Substandard rated loans are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. For each of these substandard loans, a liquidation analysis is completed. At September 30, 2024, specific reserves totaling 802 thousand were allocated within the allowance for credit losses to supplement any shortfall of collateral. 
 At December 31, 2023, we downgraded an owner-occupied commercial real estate loan totaling 19.9 million to substandard due to concerns regarding the financial condition of this borrower s parent company. During the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, the parent company closed on long term financing, strengthening its overall financial condition. As a result, we upgraded this loan to a pass rating.

We recorded annualized net recoveries to average loans receivable of (0.01) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to annualized net charge-offs of 0.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have recorded net recoveries totaling 98 thousand, compared to net charge-offs of 326 thousand for the comparable nine month period of 2023. The following table provides additional information on our asset quality for the dates presented.

 We are closely and proactively monitoring the effects of recent market activity. As mentioned above, our commercial real estate loan portfolio totale d 1.06 billion, or 57 of total loans, at September 30, 2024 and 1.09 billion, or 60 of total loans, at December 31, 2023. The commercial real estate portfolio, including construction loans, is diversified by asset type and geographic concentration. We manage this portion of the portfolio in a disciplined manner, and have comprehensive policies to monitor, measure and mitigate our loan concentrations within this portfolio segment, including rigorous credit approval, monitoring and administrative practices. Included in commercial real estate are loans secured by office buildings totaling 137.4 million, or 7 of total loans, and retail shopping centers totaling 260.7 million, or 14 of total loans, at September 30, 2024. Loans secured by multi-family commercial properties totaled 164.6 million, or 9 of total loans, at September 30, 2024. 
 The following table provides further stratification of these and additional classes of commercial real estate and construction loans at September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands).

 (2). Minimum debt service coverage policy is 1.30x for owner occupied and 1.25x for non-owner occupied at origination. 
 The loans shown in the above table exhibit strong credit quality, reflecting two classified loans at September 30, 2024 totaling 1.6 million. During our assessment of the allowance for credit losses on loans, we addressed the credit risks associated with these portfolio segments and believe that as a result of our conservative underwriting discipline at loan origination and our ongoing loan monitoring procedures, we have appropriately reserved for possible credit concerns in the event of a downturn in economic activity. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no performing loans considered potential problem loans. Potential problem loans are defined as loans that are not included in the 90 days or more past due, nonaccrual or restructured categories, but for which known information about possible credit problems causes us to be uncertain as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms which may in the future result in disclosure in the past due, nonaccrual or restructured loan categories. We take a conservative approach with respect to risk rating loans in our portfolio. Based upon the status as a potential problem loan, these loans receive heightened scrutiny and ongoing

intensive risk management. Additionally, our allowance for credit losses on loans estimation methodology adjusts expected losses to calibrate the likelihood of a default event to occur through the use of risk ratings. 
 Unexpected changes in economic growth could adversely affect our loan portfolio, including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which would adversely impact our charge-offs, allowance for credit losses, and provision for credit losses. Deterioration in real estate values, employment data and household incomes may also result in higher credit losses for us. Also, in the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry, counterparty, borrower or issuer. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our business, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities and industries, may not function as we have anticipated. 
 See Critical Accounting Policies above for more information on our allowance for credit losses methodology. 
 The following tables present additional information pertaining to the activity in and allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans by loan type and the percentage of the loan type to the total loan portfolio for the periods and at the dates presented. The allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans to a category of loans is not necessarily indicative of future losses or charge-offs, and does not restrict the use of the allowance to any specific category of loans.

 Investment Securities 
 Our investment securities portfolio is used as a source of income and liquidity. The investment portfolio consists of investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity. Investment securities available-for-sale are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily until maturity. These securities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset/liability strategy, liquidity management or regulatory capital management. Investment securities held-to-maturity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled 265 thousand and 264 thousand, respectively, and are those securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of our investment securities available-for-sale wa s 165.0 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6.6 million, or 4 , from 171.6 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to principal repayments and maturities of 11.2 million, offset by an increase in the market value of the investment securities portfolio totaling 4.6 million at September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the majority of the investment securities portfolio consisted of securities rated AAA by a leading rating agency. Investment securities which carry a AAA rating are judged to be of the best quality and carry the smallest degree of investment risk. All of our mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by either the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federa l Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or the Government National Mortgage Association. The effective duration of the investment securities portfolio continues to be slightly over five years, which is within the industry average. Investment securities that were pledged to secure public deposits totaled 45.2 million and 7.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Investment securities that were pledged to secure Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond ("FRB") borrowings totaled 6.3 million at September 30, 2024 and none at December 31, 2023. 
 In accordance with ASC 326, we complete periodic assessments on at least a quarterly basis to determine if credit deterioration exists within our investment securities portfolio and if an allowance for credit losses would be required as of a valuation date. For additional details related to management's assessment process, see the Critical Accounting Policies section above. As a result of the assessment performed as of September 30, 2024, the investment securities with unrealized losses are a result of pricing changes due to recent rising interest rate conditions in the current market environment and not as a result of credit deterioration. Contractual cash flows for agency-backed portfolios are guaranteed and funded by the U.S. government. Municipal securities have third party protective elements and there are no negative indications that the contractual cash flows will not be received when due. We do not intend to sell nor do we believe we will be re quired to sell any of our investment securities portfolio prior to the recovery of the amortized cost as of the valuation date. As such, no allowance was recognized for our investment securities portfolio as of September 30, 2024. 
 We hold restricted investments in equities of the FRB and FHLB. At September 30, 2024, we owned 4.1 million in FRB stock and 4.0 million in FHLB stock. At December 31, 2023, we owned 3.6 million in FRB stock and 5.8 million in FHLB stock.

Deposits and Other Borrowed Funds 
 The following table sets forth the average balances of deposits and the percentage of each category to total average deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 :

 Total deposits increased 115.5 million, or 6 , to 1.96 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.85 billion at December 31, 2023. Non-interest-bearing deposits were 357.0 million at September 30, 2024, or 18 of total deposits. At September 30, 2024, core deposits, which exclude wholesale deposits, increased 110.8 million from December 31, 2023, or 7 . Time deposits decreased 59.8 million, or 20 , to 246.5 million at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023, and were 14 of core deposits. 
 Wholesale deposits were 249.9 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 245.3 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 4.6 million, or 2 . Wholesale deposits are partially fixed at a weighted average rate of 3.40 as we have executed 200.0 million in pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swaps to reduce funding costs. In addition, we are a member of the IntraFi Network IntraFi ), which gives us the ability to offer Certificates of Deposit Account Registry Service CDARS and Insured Cash Sweep ICS products to our customers who seek to maximize FDIC insurance protection. When a customer places a large deposit with us for IntraFi, funds are placed into certificates of deposit or other deposit products with other banks in the CDARS and ICS networks in increments of less than 250 thousand so that principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance protection. These deposits are part of our core deposit base. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 238.1 million and 254.1 million, respectively, in CDARS reciprocal and ICS reciprocal products. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the estimated amount of total uninsured deposits (excluding collateralized deposits) was 790.0 million, or 40.3 , of total deposits. The estimate of uninsured deposits generally represents the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit of 250,000 and is calculated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for purposes of the Bank's regulatory reporting requirements. When excluding collateralized deposits, our estimate of uninsured deposits decreases to 633.7 million, or 32.3 of total deposits at September 30, 2024.

 Other borrowed funds, which include federal funds purchased, FHLB advances and Bank Term Funding Program ("BTFP") borrowings, were 57.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 85.0 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 28.0 million, or 33 . Subordinated debt, net of unamortized issuance costs, totaled 19.7 million and 19.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any federal funds purchased. During the first quarter of 2024, we borrowed 7.0 million from the BTFP. We did not access this facility during 2023. FHLB advances totaled 50.0 million and 85.0 million, respectively. All of our FHLB advances have pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swaps to reduce our funding costs, and as such, the weighted average rate of these FHLB advances are 3.60 and 3.21 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Total wholesale funding (which includes wholesale deposits, BTFP, and FHLB advances) decreased 23.4 million, or 7 , during 2024 to 306.9 million from 330.3 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 Capital adequacy is an important measure of financial stability and performance. Our objectives are to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to sustain asset growth and promote depositor and investor confidence. 
 Regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy utilizing a formula that takes into account the individual risk profile of the financial institution. The minimum capital requirements for the Bank are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratio of 4.5 ; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6 ; (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8 ; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 . Additionally, a capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5 of risk-weighted assets is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and is applicable to the Bank s CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios. Including the conservation buffer, we currently consider the Bank s minimum capital ratios to be as follows: 7.00 for CET1; 8.50 for Tier 1 capital; and 10.50 for total capital. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the minimum plus the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation. 
 Shareholders' equity at September 30, 2024 was 230.8 million, an increase of 13.7 million, compared to 217.1 million at December 31, 2023 . Net income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 contributed 10.2 million to the increase in shareholders' equity . Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased 1.4 million during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, which is primarily related to the improvement in the market value of our investment securities portfolio. 
 Total shareholders' equity to total assets for September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 10.1 and 9.9 , respectively. Tangible book value per share (a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined in the table below) at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 12.27 and 11.77, respectively. 
 As noted above, regulatory capital levels for the Bank meets those established for "well capitalized" institutions. While we are currently considered "well capitalized," we may from time to time find it necessary to access the capital markets to meet our growth objectives or capitalize on specific business opportunities. 
 As the Company is a bank holding company with less than 3.00 billion in assets, and which does not (i) conduct significant off-balance sheet activities, (ii) engage in significant non-banking activities, or (iii) have a material amount of 
 60 

securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), it is not currently subject to risk-based capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve, pursuant to the small bank holding company policy statement. The Federal Reserve has not historically deemed a bank holding company ineligible for application of the small bank holding company policy statement solely because its common stock is registered under the Exchange Act. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will continue this practice. 
 On January 1, 2020, the federal banking agencies adopted a Community Bank Leverage Ratio" ("CBLR"), which is calculated by dividing tangible equity capital by average consolidated total assets. If a qualified community bank, generally a depository institution or depository institution holding company with consolidated assets of less than 10.00 billion, opts into the CBLR framework and has a leverage ratio that exceeds the CBLR threshold, which was initially set at 9 , then such bank will be considered to have met all generally applicable leverage and risk based capital requirements under Basel III, the capital ratio requirements for well capitalized status under Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and any other leverage or capital requirements to which it is subject. A bank or holding company may be excluded from qualifying community bank status based on its risk profile, including consideration of its off-balance sheet exposures; trading assets and liabilities; total notional derivatives exposures; and such other facts as the appropriate federal banking agencies determine to be appropriate. At January 1, 2020, we qualified and adopted this simplified capital structure. Effective September 30, 2022, we opted out of the CBLR framework. A banking organization that opts out of the CBLR framework can subsequently opt back into the CBLR framework if it meets the criteria listed above. We believe that the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The following tables shows the minimum capital requirements and our capital position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for the Bank.

 Liquidity 
 Liquidity in the banking industry is defined as the ability to meet the demand for funds of both depositors and borrowers. We must be able to meet these needs by obtaining funding from depositors or other lenders or by converting non-cash items into cash. The objective of our liquidity management program is to ensure that we always have sufficient resources to meet the demands of our depositors and borrowers. Stable core deposits and a strong capital position provide the base for our liquidity position. We believe we have demonstrated our ability to attract deposits because of our convenient branch locations, personal service, technology and pricing. As of September 30, 2024, estimated uninsured deposits (excluding collateralized deposits) for the Bank increased to 32.3 of total deposits from 31.1 at December 31, 2023. 
 In addition to deposits, we have access to the various wholesale funding markets. These markets include the brokered certificate of deposit market and the federal funds market. We are a member of the IntraFi Network, which allows banking customers to access FDIC insurance protection on deposits through the Bank which exceed FDIC insurance limits. As part of our membership with the IntraFi Network, we have one-way authority for both their CDARs and ICS products which provides the Bank the ability to access additional wholesale funding as needed. We also maintain secured lines of credit with the FRB and the FHLB for which we can borrow up to the allowable amount for the collateral pledged. Having diverse funding alternatives reduces our reliance on any one source for funding. 
 Liquid assets, which include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale, totaled 342.7 million at September 30, 2024, or 15 of total assets, an increase from 232.1 million, or 11 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 45.2 million and 7.2 million, respectively, in investment securities available for sale were pledged as collateral for municipal deposits and BTFP. 
 Cash flow from amortizing assets or maturing assets also provides funding to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers.

 We have established a formal liquidity contingency plan which establishes a liquidity management team and provides guidelines for liquidity management. For our liquidity management program, we first determine our current liquidity position and then forecast liquidity based on anticipated changes in the balance sheet. In this forecast, we expect to maintain a liquidity cushion. We also stress test our liquidity position under several different stress scenarios, from moderate to severe. Guidelines for the forecasted liquidity cushion and for liquidity cushions for each stress scenario have been established. We believe that we have sufficient resources to meet our liquidity needs. 
 Liquidity is essential to our business. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen outflows of cash, including deposits. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as general market disruption, negative views about the financial services industry generally, or an operational problem that affects a third party or us. Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events. While we believe we have a healthy liquidity position and do not anticipate the loss of deposits of any of the significant deposit customers, any of the factors discussed above could materially impact our liquidity position in the future. 
 
 Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Credit Risk 
 We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. 
 The Bank s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. We evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis and require collateral to support financial instruments when deemed necessary. The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on our evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include deposits held by us, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties. 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates up to one year or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. These instruments represent obligations to extend credit or guarantee borrowings and are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The rates and terms of these instruments are competitive with others in the market in which we do business. 
 Unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. Those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we have committed. 
 Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. We hold certificates of deposit, deposit accounts, and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. 
 With the exception of these off-balance sheet arrangements, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, changes in financial condition, revenue, expenses, capital expenditures, or capital resources, that is material to our business. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unused commitments to fund loans and lines of credit totaled 226.5 million and 252.5 million, respectively. Commercial and standby letters of credit totaled 23.9 million at September 30, 2024 and 26.0 million at December 31, 2023, respectively.
