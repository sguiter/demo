 NOTES
TO INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 September
30, 2024 

 (Unaudited) 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments, unless
otherwise indicated) necessary to present fairly our consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
and the results of our consolidated operations for the interim periods presented. We follow the same accounting policies when preparing
quarterly financial data as we use for preparing annual data. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and the notes included in our latest annual report on Form 10-K/A, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 Form
10-K/A ), and our other reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 

million
shares of SHRG beneficially held by DSS and Decentralized Sharing Systems in the form of a dividend to the shareholders of DSS common
stock. Upon completion of this distribution, DSS will retain an ownership interest in SHRG of approximately . Immediately prior to
this distribution, DSS owned approximately of the issued and outstanding common shares of SHRG. As a result, SHRG, whose operations
represented a significant portion of our Direct Marketing segment, was deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements effective
as of May 1, 2023 (the Deconsolidation ). The consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal quarter ended September
30, 2023, therefore includes one month of activity related to SHRG prior to the Deconsolidation. Subsequent to April 30, 2023 the assets
and liabilities of SHRG are no longer included within our consolidated balance sheets. Any discussions related to results, operations,
and accounting policies associated with SHRG refer to the periods prior to the Deconsolidation. 

Upon
Deconsolidation, we recognized an impairment of assets due to the deconsolidation of SHRG approximately which
is recorded as an impairment of assets due to the deconsolidation in our consolidated statements
of operations. Subsequent to the Deconsolidation, we accounted for our equity ownership interest in SHRG as a marketable security and
at the quoted price stock price of SHRG, valued at approximately at December 31, 2023.

As

 and of our consolidated trade accounts receivable balance. 

As

accounts receivable balance. 

The
carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaids, accounts payable
and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. Marketable
securities classify as a Level 1 fair value financial instrument. The fair value of notes receivable approximates their carrying value
as the stated or discounted rates of the notes do not reflect recent market conditions. The fair value of revolving credit lines notes
payable and long-term debt approximates their carrying value as the stated or discounted rates of the debt reflect recent market conditions.
The fair value of investments where the fair value is not considered readily determinable, are carried at cost.

million in cash, the Company has incurred operating losses as well as negative cash flows from operating and investing activities over
the past two years. 

Aside
from its million in cash as of September 30, 2024, the Company believes it can continue as a going concern, due to its ability
to generate operating cash through the sale of its million of Marketable Securities. The Company has also taken steps to sell its
real estate holdings assets of AMRE LifeCare and Winter Haven located in Texas, Pennsylvania, and Florida. These properties approximate
 million in assets and are identified on the accompanying balance sheet as Held for sale. In addition, the Company has taken steps,
and will continue to take measures, to materially reduce the expenses and cash burn at all corporate and business line levels. Although
there are no assurances, we believe the above would allow us to fund our nine business lines current and planned operations for the twelve
months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report. Based on this, the Company has concluded that substantial doubt of its ability to
continue as a going concern has been alleviated. 

million shares of Sharing Service Global Corporation SHRG ), beneficially
held by the Company, in the form of a dividend to the shareholders of the Company s common stock. Upon completion of this distribution,
the Company retained an ownership interest in SHRG of approximately . Effective May 1, 2023, SHRG was deconsolidated from the consolidated
financial statements (the Deconsolidation ). The consolidated statement of operations does not include SHRG activity after
April 30, 2023 and the assets and liabilities of SHRG are no longer included within the Company s consolidated balance sheet. In
the 10-Q for the second quarter of 2023, the Company recorded an approximate million loss on deconsolidation. The Company also
recorded an decrease in accumulated deficit of million to reflect the reversal of balances as of deconsolidation. In preparation
of the Form S-3 as well as the September 30, 2024 10-Q filing this transaction was revisited and it was determined that loss was unintentionally
overstated by approximately million driven primarily by the increases in accumulated deficit that should have been recorded as
an offset to the initial income statement loss. In addition, the Company has determined that Deconsolidation also requires the recognition
of discontinued operations. Management and the Audit Committee of the Company has concluded that restatement of its December 31, 2023
financial statements, filed on March 27, 2024, was required.

Costs
of revenue include all direct costs of the Company s printed products, including its packaging and printing sales and its direct
marketing sales, materials, direct labor, transportation, and manufacturing facility costs. In addition, this category includes all direct
costs associated with the Company s technology sales, services and licensing including hardware and software that are resold, third-party
fees, and fees paid to inventors or others because of technology licenses or settlements, if any. Cost of revenue for our Securities
operating segments is comprised mainly of our REIT line of business and includes all direct cost associated with the maintenance and
upkeep of the related facilities, depreciation, amortization, and the costs to acquire the facilities. 

Our Commercial Lending operating
segment has costs of revenue associated with the impairment of notes receivable for those amounts at risk of collection. Total costs of
revenue decreased 5 for nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 is primarily related to the decrease in revenue associate
with the change in the Direct marketing business plan that has been slow to generate revenue as well as decrease in revenues from our
Printed product business line. 

Sales, general and administrative
compensation costs, excluding stock-based compensation, decreased 18 for nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023
is primarily related the decrease in head count as the change in business plan from maintaining our own sales force for the Direct marketing
business segment to licensing its products. 

Professional fees decreased
32 for nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 due primarily to primarily due to efforts taken to decrease these cost
primarily at the Company s Impact Bio subsidiary in anticipation of its IPO. 

Sales and marketing which
include internet and trade publication advertising, travel and entertainment costs, sales-broker commissions, and trade show participation
expenses. Sales and marketing remained flat during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 due as the decrease in
such cost associated with our Direct marketing business segment were offset by increases in our Printed Products and Biotechnology business
segments. 

Rent and utilities decreased
15 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to end of the lease in Tennessee for AMRE office
space and California for the Company s DSS Wealth Management subsidiary. 

Research and development 
costs represent costs consisting primarily of independent, third-party testing of the various properties of each technology the Company
owns possesses as well as research on new technologies. These costs decreased 93 the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to September 30, 2023, due primarily to the cessation of the Company s research and development contract with GRDG at the end of
2023. 

Other operating expenses consist
primarily of equipment maintenance and repairs, office supplies, IT support, and insurance costs. These costs decrease approximately 56 
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023, due primarily to the write-off of accounts receivable
associated with our AMRE LifeCare facilities of approximately 3,023,000 in 2023 as the tenant was unable to pay rent.

(Loss) gain on
investments consists of net realized losses on marketable securities which are recognized as the difference between the purchase
price and sale price of the common stock investment, and net unrealized losses on marketable securities which are recognized on the
change in fair market value on our common stock investment. The decrease in loss on investment for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 as compared to 2023 is driven by better performance of our stock portfolio. 

Impairment of assets upon deconsolidation 
represents the impairment of assets recognized due to the deconsolidation of SHRG approximately
 6,220,000 which is recorded as an impairment of assets due to the deconsolidation in
our consolidated statements of operations.

For the nine months ended September
30, 2024 the Company recorded net losses of 15,762,000 as compared to net losses of 33,061,000 for the same period in 2023. The decrease
in net loss is driven by decreases in the Provision for loan losses, impairment of assets upon deconsolidation, the improved performance
of our stock portfolio as well as the deconsolidation of SHRG. 

30 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The
Company has historically met its liquidity and capital requirements primarily through the sale of its equity securities and debt financing.
As of September 30, 2024 the Company had cash of approximately 11.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company believes that it has sufficient
cash to meet its cash requirements for at least the next 12 months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report. In addition, the Company
believes that it will have access to sources of capital from the sale of its equity securities and debt financing. The deconsolidation
of SHRG and sale of HWH Holdings, Inc, two companies with historical losses, also is expected to improve future cash flows. 

Cash
Flow from Continuing Operating Activities 

Net
cash used by operating activities was 9,181,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 21,035,000 for nine months ended
September, 2023. This fluctuation is driven by decreases in net loss, after reconciling items, approximating 371,000. Also, the Company paid
litigation losses during the 1 st quarter of 2023 of approximately 8,750,000. 

Cash
Flow from Investing Activities 

Net
cash provided by investing activities was 9,916,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net cash provided by investing
activities of 11,885,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This fluctuation is driven by the sale of marketable securities approximating
 11,330,000 during 2023 versus a sale of 3,029,000 during 2024. This is offset by receipts on Notes receivable of 4,039,000 in 2024
versus 1,419,000 in 2023. 

Cash
Flow from Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 4,281,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net cash used by financing activities
of 3,243,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This variance is driven by payments toward long term debt of 1,492,000 in 2024
versus 4,056,000 in 2023. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, an effect on our financial condition,
financial statements, revenues, or expenses. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions
and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. The financial statements as of December
31, 2023, describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the financial statements. There have been
no material changes to such critical accounting policies as of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

31 

ITEM
4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e)
and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on this
evaluation and on the material weaknesses disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 which remained
as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is being recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms, and that our disclosure controls are not effectively designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is being accumulated and communicated to management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

Plan
for Remediation of Material Weaknesses 

As
discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has a remediation plan and is committed
to maintaining a strong internal control environment and believes that these remediation efforts will represent significant improvements
in our controls. The Company has started to implement these steps, however, some of these steps will take time to be fully integrated
and confirmed to be effective and sustainable. Additional controls may also be required over time. Until the remediation steps set forth
above are fully implemented and tested, the material weaknesses described above will continue to exist. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

While
changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as the Company
began implementation of the remediation steps described above, we believe that there were no changes in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board. As used in these Fifth Amended and Restated By-Laws
of the Corporation (the By-Laws ), the term entire Board means the total authorized number of directors which
the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies. 

(1.3)

within or without the state of incorporation, as the Board may designate, by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority

2 BOARD OF DIRECTORS 

(2.1)
 Number . The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time by action of the shareholders or by resolution
adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board; provided that such number of directors shall not be less than three
nor more than eleven, unless and until otherwise determined by vote of a majority of the entire Board; and provided further that no decrease
in the number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. 

(2.2)
 Election of Directors . 

(a)
Except as may otherwise be provided herein or in the Corporation s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (such Certificate of
Incorporation, and any amendments thereof, hereinafter collectively referred to as the Certificate ), the members of the
Board, who need not be shareholders of the Corporation, shall each be elected by receiving a majority of the votes cast by the holders
of shares of such class entitled to vote generally in the election of directors at each succeeding annual meeting of the shareholders
of the Corporation (a Majority Vote ); provided, however, that in the event of a Contested Election, directors
shall be elected by a plurality vote. For this purpose, a Contested Election means an election in which nominees for election
are to be voted on who have not been recommended for election by the Board or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee thereof
or as to which the number of nominees for election at the meeting exceeds the number of directors to be elected at such meeting. 

(b)
The Board shall only nominate for election or re-election to the Board and shall only fill director vacancies and elect persons to new
directorships candidates who agree to tender, before they are nominated for election or re-election as directors, irrevocable resignations
that will be effective upon (i) the failure to receive a Majority Vote at the next meeting at which they stand for election or re-election
(unless there is a Contested Election at such meeting) and (ii) the Board s acceptance of such resignation. If a director nominee
fails to receive the required vote for election or re-election, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board will act
on an expedited basis to recommend whether the Board should accept the director s resignation and will submit such recommendation
for prompt consideration by the Board. Pending such final determination by the Board as to whether to accept such resignation, the director
shall have no right to participate in such determination except and solely to the extent (if any) specifically required by the Board
or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee thereof (as applicable). 

(2.3)

been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such director s earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal. 

(2.4)

the Corporation, and may exercise all powers of the Corporation, except as are in the Certificate or by statute expressly conferred upon

(2.6)
 Notices . Upon taking office, each director shall file with the Secretary a written designation of the address that the director
desires to be used for the purpose of giving notices to him. Until the director shall have effectively done so, he shall be deemed to
have designated either the principal office of the Corporation or any other address that the sender of the notice could reasonably believe
to be an appropriate address. Any designated address may be re-designated by similar filing with the Secretary. The Secretary shall give
each of the other directors prompt notice of every designation or re-designation filed. The designation or re-designation shall be effective
three business days after the Secretary s action or upon earlier receipt. Any notice to a director shall be valid if sent to either
(a) the director s designated address or (b) any other address used in good faith unless it be shown that prejudice resulted from
use of such other address. All notices must be in writing. Any notice may be delivered by hand or sent by telecommunications device,
by e-mail, by regular mail, by overnight courier, or by similar means. 

(2.7)
 Resignation . A director may resign at any time by giving notice to each of the other directors or to the Corporation. Unless
otherwise specified, the notice shall be effective immediately and acceptance shall not be necessary to make it effective. A director
need not assign cause for resigning. 

(2.8)
 Newly Created Directorships; Vacancies . Newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors
and any vacancies on the Board resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal or other reason may be filled
solely by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and
any director so chosen shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the departed director and until his or her successor has
been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such director s earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal. 

(2.9)
 Removal . (i) Any director, or the entire Board, may be removed by the shareholders from office at any time prior to the expiration
of his or their respective terms of office, but only for cause, and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of record of outstanding
shares representing a majority of the voting power of all the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, and (ii) any director may be removed from office by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
entire Board, at any time prior to the expiration of his term of office, but only for cause. 

(2.10)
 Rights of Preferred Shareholders . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2, and except as otherwise required
by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to
elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships
shall be governed by the terms of such series of Preferred Stock.

any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board. Any action authorized, in writing, by all of the directors entitled
to vote thereon and filed with the minutes of the Corporation shall be the act of the Board with the same force and effect as if the
same had been passed by unanimous vote at a duly called meeting of the Board. 

(c)
Where appropriate communication facilities are reasonably available, any or all directors shall have the right to participate in any
Board meeting, or committee meeting, by means of a conference telephone or any means of communication by which all persons participating

which such action is taken. Such interested director or directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at such meeting.
This Section 3.8 shall not be construed to impair or invalidate or in any way affect any contract or other transaction which would otherwise
be valid under the law (common, statutory or otherwise) applicable thereto. 

(3.9)
 Committees . The Board, by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board, may from time to time designate from among

members thereof, as they deem desirable, each consisting of three or more directors (or such lesser number as is permitted by the rules
of the stock exchange or over-the-counter market on which the Corporation s stock is then traded), with such powers and authority
(to the extent permitted by law) as may be provided in such resolution. Each such committee shall serve at the pleasure of the Board.

for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by said resolution or by these By-Laws. Participation of any one or more
members of the committee by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment allowing all persons participating in
the meeting to hear each other at the same time, shall constitute presence in person at any such meeting. Any action authorized in writing
by all of the members of a committee entitled to vote thereon and filed with the minutes of the committee shall be the act of the committee
with the same force and effect as if the same had been passed by unanimous vote at a duly called meeting of the committee. 

(3.10)
 Regulations . The Board may adopt rules and regulations not inconsistent with law, the Certificate or these By-Laws, for the
conduct of its meetings and the management of all aspects of the affairs of the Corporation. 

(3.11)

of the Corporation.

shall be no more than twenty (20) calendar days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
and shall not precede the date such resolution is adopted. If the Board fails within ten (10) calendar days after the Corporation receives
such notice to fix a record date for such purpose, the record date shall be the day on which the first written consent is delivered to
the Corporation in the manner described in paragraph (d) of this Section 5.11; except that, if prior action by the Board is required

to be made as of the record date), and not later than three (3) business days prior to the date the consent solicitation is commenced
(in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of five (5) business days prior to the date the consent solicitation
is commenced). 

Notwithstanding
anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, no action may be taken by the shareholders by written consent without a meeting except in
accordance with this Section 5.11. If the Board shall determine that any request to fix a record date or to take shareholder action by
written consent without a meeting was not properly made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.11, or the shareholder or
shareholders seeking to take such action do not otherwise comply with the provisions of this Section 5.11, including paragraph (b) of
this Section 5.11, then the Board shall not be required to fix a record date and any such purported action by written consent shall be
null and void to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. In addition to the requirements of this Section 5.11 with respect to
shareholders seeking to take an action by written consent without a meeting, each person seeking to have the shareholders authorize or
take corporate action by written consent without a meeting shall comply with all requirements of applicable law, including all requirements
of the Exchange Act, with respect to such action. 

(c)

is referred to in this paragraph and in paragraph (d) as a Consent must bear the date of signature of each shareholder
who signs the Consent, and no Consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) calendar
days of the earliest dated Consent delivered in the manner required by this Section 5.11, Consents signed by a sufficient number of shareholders
to take such action are so delivered to the Corporation. 

(d)
 Delivery of Consent . Consent must be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its principal executive office. Delivery must
be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. 

In
the event of the delivery to the Corporation of Consents, the Secretary of the Corporation, or such other officer of the Corporation
as the Board may designate, shall provide for the safekeeping of such Consents and any related revocations and shall promptly conduct
such ministerial review of the sufficiency of all Consents and any related revocations and of the validity of the action to be taken

attorneys fees, reasonably incurred in defending any action or proceeding in advance of the final disposition thereof upon receipt
of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if such person is ultimately found not to be entitled to indemnification

corporate action or enter into any agreement which prohibits, or otherwise limits the rights of any person to, indemnification in accordance

directors, officers and employees of the Corporation, by serving as such after the adoption hereof, are acting in reliance hereon and

in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and the affected provision shall be given the fullest possible enforcement in the circumstances,
it being the intention of the Corporation to afford indemnification and advancement of expenses to its directors, officers and employees,
acting in such capacities or in the other capacities mentioned herein, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

purposes of these By-Laws, the Corporation shall be deemed to have requested a person to serve an employee benefit plan where the performance
by such person of his or her duties to the Corporation also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, such person to the
plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan, and excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant
to applicable law shall be considered indemnifiable expenses. For purposes of these By-Laws, the term Corporation shall
