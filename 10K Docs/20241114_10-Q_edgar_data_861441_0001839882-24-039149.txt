Value of Units 

The
following fees are paid to the General Partner: 

General
 Partner Management Fee the Fund incurs a monthly fee on Class A, A2, B and R
 Units equal to 1/12 th of of the month-end net asset value of the Class
 A, A2, B and R Units, payable in arrears. The Fund incurs a monthly fee on Class I Units
 equal to 1/12 th of of the month-end net asset value of the Class I Units,
 payable in arrears. The Fund incurs a monthly fee on Class I Units equal to 1/12 th
 of of the month-end net asset value of the Class I Units, payable in arrears.
 The General Partner was paid management fees of and for the three-month
 and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and was and 
 for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

General
 Partner Performance Fee the Fund incurs a monthly fee on Class I Units of any Net New Trading Profits of the Class I Units calculated monthly. In determining
 Net New Trading Profits, any trading losses incurred by the Class I Units in prior periods
 is carried forward, so that the incentive fee is assessed only if and to the extent the
 profits generated by the Class I units exceed any losses from prior periods. The general
 partner performance fee is payable quarterly in arrears. For the three-month and nine-month
 periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the General Partner did not earn a General Partner
 performance fee. 

Selling
 Agent Fees the Class A Units incur a monthly fee of
 the Class A Units. Class A2 Units may pay an up-front 
 The
 General Partner, in turn, pays the selling agent fees to the respective selling agents. If
 there is no designated selling agent or the General Partner was the selling agent, such portions
 of the selling agent fees are retained by the General Partner. The General Partner was paid selling agent fees of and for the three-month and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and was and for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Broker
 Dealer Servicing Fees the Class B Units incur a monthly fee of
 the Class B Units. The General Partner, in turn, pays the fees to the respective selling
 agents. If there is no designated selling agent or the General Partner was the selling agent,
 such portions of the broker dealer servicing fees are retained by the General Partner. Broker-dealer
 servicing fees were and for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
 September 30, 2024, respectively, and were and for the three-month and nine-month
 periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Administrative
 Expenses the Fund incurs a monthly fee of
 the Fund, payable in arrears to the General Partner. In return, the General Partner provides
 operating and administrative services, including accounting, audit, legal, marketing, and
 administration (exclusive of extraordinary costs and administrative expenses charged by other
 funds in which the Fund may have investments). The General Partner was paid administrative expenses of and for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2024, respectively, and was and for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September
30, 2023, respectively. 

to per annum of allocated net assets (as defined in each respective advisory agreement as the
amount of Fund assets deposited in the account maintained with the broker plus any notional funds which may be allocated to the

and , respectively, with brokers and margin deposit requirements

for Class A, A2, B and R units and for Class
I units. Units are sold at the respective net asset value per unit for Class A, A2, B, I or R interests as of the close of business
on the last day of the month in which the subscription is accepted. Investors whose subscriptions are accepted are admitted as
limited partners as of the beginning of the month following the month in which their subscriptions were accepted. 

The
Fund is not required to make distributions but may do so at the sole discretion of the General Partner. A limited partner may
request and receive redemption of Class A, A2, B, I or R Units owned at the end of any month, subject to five business days 
prior written notice to the General Partner, and in certain circumstances, restrictions in the Partnership Agreement. 

The
General Partner may require a limited partner to redeem from the Fund if the General Partner deems the redemption (a) necessary
to prevent or correct the occurrence of a non-exempt prohibited transaction under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (b) beneficial to the Fund, or (c) necessary to comply
with applicable government or other self-regulatory organization regulations. 

The
foregoing could lead to a significant economic downturn or recession, increased market volatility, a greater number of market
closures, higher default rates and adverse effects on the values and liquidity of securities or other assets. Such impacts, which
may vary across asset classes, may adversely affect the performance of the Portfolios. In certain cases, an exchange or market
may close or issue trading halts on specific securities or even the entire market, which may result in the Portfolios being, among
other things, unable to buy or sell certain securities or financial instruments or to accurately price their investments. 

Purchase
and sale of futures contracts requires margin deposits with the futures brokers. Additional deposits may be necessary for any
loss of contract value. The Commodity Exchange Act CEAct requires a broker to segregate all customer transactions
and assets from such broker s proprietary activities. A customer s cash and other property (for example, U.S. Treasury
securities) deposited with a broker are considered commingled with all other customer funds subject to the broker s segregation
requirements. In the event of a broker s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available.
It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than (or none of) the total cash and other property deposited. The Fund
uses SG Americas Securities, LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. as its futures brokers. The Fund uses Goldman Sachs 
Company, LLC and Deutsche Bank AG as its forward currency counterparties. 

For
futures contracts, risks arise from changes in the fair value of the contracts. Theoretically, the Fund is exposed to a market
risk equal to the value of futures and forward currency contracts purchased, and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. 

In
addition to market risk, upon entering into commodity interest contracts there is a credit risk that a counterparty will not be
able to meet its obligations to the Fund. The counterparty for futures and options on futures contracts traded in the U.S. and
on most non-U.S. futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchanges. In general, clearinghouses are backed
by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance
by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed
by the clearing members, like some non-U.S. exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. 

In
the case of forward currency contracts, which are traded on the interbank or other institutional market rather than on exchanges,
the counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearinghouse backed by a group of financial
institutions; thus, there likely will be greater counterparty credit risk. While the Fund trades only with those counterparties
that it believes to be creditworthy, there can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will
be able to meet its obligations to the Fund. 

The
Fund trades forward currency contracts in unregulated markets between principals and assumes the risk of loss from counterparty
non-performance. Accordingly, the risks associated with forward currency contracts are generally greater than those associated
with exchange-traded contracts because of the greater risk of counterparty default. Additionally, the trading of forward currency
contracts typically involves delayed cash settlement. 

The
Fund has a portion of its assets on deposit with interbank market makers and other financial institutions in connection with its
trading of forward currency contracts and its cash management activities. In the event of an interbank market maker s or
financial institution s insolvency, recovery of Fund assets on deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection
afforded such deposits. 

Entering
into swap agreements involves, to varying degrees, credit, market, and counterparty risk in excess of the amounts recognized on
the statement of financial condition. 

The
Cash Managers manage the Fund s cash and excess margin through investments in fixed income instruments, pursuant to investment
parameters established by the General Partner. Fluctuations in prevailing interest rates could cause mark-to-market losses on
the Fund s fixed income instruments. 

Through
its investments in debt securities and certificates of deposit, the Fund has exposure to U.S. and foreign enterprises.

Results
from past periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any future period. Monthly analysis of the
trading gains and losses is provided below. 

2024 

January 

 Equities
continued their move to the upside in January, albeit at a moderated pace, as the S P 500 Index hit an all-time high
intra month and finished the period up +1.68 . Bonds did not fair the same as the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index
finished modestly in negative territory, down -0.27 . Outside of traditional asset classes, commodities rose during the
month, particularly oil, which gained over +5 after falling significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023. The U.S. Dollar
moved upward against the backdrop of shifting investor sentiment surrounding Federal Reserve interest rate policy. 

LoCorr
Futures Portfolio Fund rose in January, a strong start to the year. The Fund was able to deliver positive returns while seeking
to provide diversification, a benefit relative to traditional asset allocation strategies. The strong month was boosted by equities,
agricultural commodities, and energies while interest rates and metals detracted. Foreign currency positioning was not a significant
driver of returns in the month. The Fund finished with a net gain of 2.62 ,2.74 ,2.77 , 2.85 and 2.79 for Class A, A2, B, I,
and R Units, respectively. 

February 

 Equities
continued their move to the upside in February at an accelerated cadence from the month prior, as the S P 500 Index hit an
all-time high intra-month and finished the period up +5.34 , bringing the YTD return to up +7.11 . Bonds did not fair the same
as the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index finished in negative territory, down -1.41 , bringing its YTD return to down -1.68 .
Outside of traditional asset classes, commodities fell during the month, despite a strong upward move for oil which has gained
over +9 in 2024 after falling significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023. The U.S. Dollar moved upward against the backdrop
of shifting investor perception on the timing of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. 

LoCorr
Futures Portfolio Fund rose in February, adding to a strong start for the year. The Fund delivered a positive return while providing
diversification relative to traditional asset classes. The strong month was boosted by equities, agricultural commodities, interest
rates, and FX, while metals were a modest detractor. The Fund finished with a net gain of 7.20 , 7.32 , 7.36 , 7.44 and 7.37 
for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

March 

 Equities
continued their move to the upside in March as the S P 500 Index hit an all-time high intra month and finished the period
up +3.22 , bringing its YTD return to up +10.56 . Bonds had their first positive month of the year, as the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate
Bond Index was up +0.92 , but still in negative territory YTD, down -0.78 . Outside of traditional asset classes, commodities
rose in March, boosted by higher oil prices. The U.S Dollar was relatively flat as U.S. Treasury yields stabilized amid investors
seeking additional clarification on the Federal Reserve s next steps. 

The
LoCorr Futures Portfolio Fund rose in March, adding to its strong start for the year. The positive month was boosted by equities,
currencies, energy products, and agricultural commodities while modest gains in metals trading were offset by losses in interest
rates. The Fund finished with a net gain of 4.97 , 5.09 , 5.12 , 5.21 and 5.14 for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

April 

 Equities
fell in April, deviating from the monthly uptrend that has persisted since November of 2023, as the S P 500 Index dropped
-4.08 , bringing its YTD return to up +6.04 . Bonds again failed to protect, as the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index sold off
-2.53 , pushing its YTD return down to -3.28 . Outside of traditional asset classes, commodities rose on a strong move higher
by industrial metals. The U.S. Dollar rallied against a broad basket of foreign currencies as the U.S. economy showed signs of
strength. 

The
LoCorr Futures Portfolio Fund rose again in April, adding to its strong start for the year. The positive month was bolstered
by interest rates, currencies, and metals, while gains in these markets were somewhat offset by modest losses in equities,
energy products, and agricultural commodities. The Fund finished with a net gain of 3.16 , 3.28 , 3.31 , 3.40 and 3.33 for
Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively.

rose in May, rebounding from a loss of -4.08 in April, as the S P 500 Index gained +4.96 , bringing its YTD return to up
+11.30 . Bonds were slightly positive, as the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index rose +1.70 bringing its YTD return to down
-1.64 . Outside of traditional asset classes, commodities rose on a move higher in grains and precious metals. The U.S. Dollar
moved downward against the backdrop of shifting investor appetite to risk-on assets. 

31 

The
LoCorr Futures Portfolio Fund posted a modest loss in May but is still in strong positive territory this year. The negative month
was driven by interest rates, currencies, energy products, and agricultural commodities, while losses in these markets were somewhat
offset by gains in metals and stock indices. The Fund finished with a net loss of (2.59) , (2.48) , (2.44) , (2.37) and (2.43) 
for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

June 

 Equities
rose in June, continuing the gains in May, as the S P 500 Index rose +3.59 , bringing its YTD return to up +15.29 . Bonds
were slightly positive, as the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index rose +0.95 bringing its YTD return to down -0.71 . Outside
of traditional asset classes, commodities fell on a move lower in grains and industrial metals. The U.S. Dollar moved upward on
stronger economic data and hawkish Fed comments. 

The
LoCorr Futures Portfolio Fund posted a modest loss in June but is still in strong positive territory this year. The negative
month was driven by interest rates, currencies, metals, and stock indices, while losses in these markets were somewhat offset
by gains in agricultural commodities and energy products. The Fund finished with a net loss of (2.89) , (2.78) , (2.74) ,
(2.67) and (2.73) for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

July 

 Equities
rose in July, adding to the gains in previous months, as the S P 500 Index was up +1.22 , bringing its YTD return to +16.70 .
Despite equities being positive during the month, a strong selloff began on the 17th as weak economic data began to surface. The
Yen rallied strongly against the U.S. Dollar after a series of interventions from the Bank of Japan. Bonds were also positive
during the month, as the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index recovered from negative territory, rising +2.34 and bringing its
YTD return to up +1.61 . Outside of traditional asset classes, commodities fell on a move lower in energy, grains, and industrial
metals. The U.S. Dollar moved downward on weaker economic data. 

The
LoCorr Futures Portfolio Fund posted a loss in July but remains positive year to date. The negative month was driven largely by
currency trades, interest rates, and energies, while those losses were somewhat offset by gains in agricultural commodities The
Fund finished with a net loss of (5.24) , (5.13) , (5.09) , (5.02) and (5.08) for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

August 

 Despite
a strong selloff early in the month on weaker economic data, equities rose in August, adding to the gains in previous months,
as the S P 500 Index was up +2.43 , bringing its YTD return to +19.53 . The yen continued its strong rally against the U.S.
Dollar after a series of interventions from the Bank of Japan. Overall, the U.S. Dollar moved downward against other major currencies
on weaker economic data. Bonds were also positive during the month, as the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index continued its recovery
from negative territory, rising +1.44 and bringing its YTD return to up +3.07 . Outside of traditional asset classes, commodities
were flat as gains in softs and metals were offset by losses in energy. 

The
LoCorr Futures Portfolio Fund posted a loss in August, driven by currencies, energies, interest rates, equities, and metals,
while those losses were somewhat offset by gains in agricultural commodities. The Fund finished with a net loss of (6.05) ,
(5.94) , (5.91) , (5.83) and (5.89) for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

September 

 The
Federal Reserve finally cut interest rates by half a percentage point in September. This led to a rise in equities,
as the S P 500 Index was up another +2.14 , bringing its YTD return to +22.08 . Bonds were also positive during the month,
as the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index continued its recovery from negative territory, rising +1.34 and bringing its YTD
return to up +4.45 . Outside of traditional asset classes, commodity prices in agriculture, metals, and natural gas rose while
oil sold off. The U.S. Dollar moved downward against a basket of foreign currencies on weaker economic data and doveish Fed comments. 

The
LoCorr Futures Portfolio Fund posted a gain in September, driven by equities, metals, interest rates, and currencies. Those gains
were somewhat offset by losses in energy and agricultural commodities, but overall, the Fund finished in positive territory for
the month. The Fund finished with a net gain of 0.24 , 0.36 , 0.39 , 0.47 and 0.41 for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively.

2023 

January 

 Risk
markets rebounded to start the new year, with the S P 500 Index rising +6.28 . Investor confidence was sparked by hopes of
a slowdown in the Federal Reserve s interest rate hike campaign and optimism that a hard landing can be avoided.
Bonds also rallied during the period, moving in tandem with equities, up +3.08 , after capping off the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate
Bond Index s worst year since its inception in 1980. The U.S. Dollar, which had seen gains for much of 2022, continued its
slide from its fourth quarter weakness, down over -1.3 in January. 

Futures
Portfolio Fund (the Fund fell modestly in January as low volatility provided limited trading opportunities for
the Fund s managers. While a majority of the Fund s sectors detracted from performance, the Fund was profitable in
equity index and energy trading. Despite the negative performance, this month highlighted the Fund s ability to be sizably
invested in different themes, which has helped provide a positive return versus the losses sustained by major bond and equity
indices in 2022. The Fund finished with a net loss of (0.93) , (0.81) , (0.78) , (0.70) and (0.76) for Class A, A2, B, I, and
R Units, respectively. 

February 

 After
a brief recovery in January, the S P 500 Index resumed its downward trend in February, losing -2.44 and dropping its year-to-date
return to +3.69 . At the same time, bonds again failed to protect investor capital, selling off -2.59 and leaving the Bloomberg
U.S. Aggregate Bond Index up just +0.41 YTD. Negatively impacting equity and fixed income markets was a concern that elevated
inflation would last longer than expected and therefore prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates. The U.S. Dollar,
which slid in the fourth quarter of 2022, rebounded in February, up +2.72 . The strength in the Dollar, however, proved to be
a headwind for commodities, as the Bloomberg Commodity TR USD Index fell -4.70 during the period. 

Futures
Portfolio Fund s (the Fund positive return in February was overwhelmingly driven by short bond positioning
and, to a lesser extent, long U.S. Dollar positioning. While energy, metals, and equity trading were modest detractors, the strong
month highlighted the Fund s ability to be sizably invested in different themes, helping to provide positive returns against
the losses suffered by major bond and equity indices. The Fund finished with a net gain of 2.35 , 2.47 , 2.50 , 2.58 and 2.52 
for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

March 

Amid
heightened volatility related to stress in the banking sector, stocks and bonds both recovered some of February s losses
in the month of March, with the S P 500 Index up +7.50 YTD and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index up +2.96 . Positively
impacting both equity and fixed income markets was optimism surrounding a possible pause in rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
As a result, the short end of the U.S. Treasury yield curve (2-year Treasury) experienced its largest move since 1987. 

Futures
Portfolio Fund (the Fund fell in March, as the short fixed income trend, which had heavily contributed year-to-date
and in 2022, sharply reversed course. While a majority of other sectors detracted, the Fund s managers were able to adjust
for heightened market volatility and adjust position sizing accordingly. March performance was overwhelmingly driven by the aforementioned
short bond positioning. This nimble approach, inherent in managing risk, allowed the Fund to mitigate losses. The Fund finished
with a net loss of (6.95) , (6.84) , (6.81) , (6.74) and (6.79) for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

April 

 Relative
to recent months, April proved to be a quiet period for stocks and bonds as recessionary fears, stoked by rising interest rates
and banking failures, subsided. The S P 500 Index continued to move higher, albeit at a slower pace, gaining +1.56 in the
period, bringing its YTD return to up +9.17 . Bonds, as represented by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, added +0.61 in
the month which brought their YTD return to up +3.59 . 

Futures
Portfolio Fund s (the Fund positive return in April was overwhelmingly driven by agricultural commodities,
specifically sugar and wheat, and long U.S. Dollar positioning, specifically against the Japanese Yen. While energies, metals,
and interest rates were modest detractors, the strong month highlighted the Fund s ability to be sizably invested in different
themes, helping to provide positive returns even when traditional long only bond and stock indices were modestly positive. The
Fund finished with a net gain of 2.51 , 2.63 , 2.67 , 2.75 and 2.68 for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

May 

 Debt
ceiling talks and risk of a U.S. default added to volatility during May. The Fed raised interest rates another 25 basis points
early in the month, continuing its fight against persistently high inflation. The S P 500 Index edged higher, up just +0.43 
in the period, bringing its YTD return to +9.65 . Bonds, as represented by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, reversed course
dropping -1.09 in May, bringing its YTD return to +2.46 . 

33 

Futures
Portfolio Fund s (the Fund positive return in May was largely driven by currencies and energies trading,
specifically long U.S. Dollar positioning against the Chinese Renminbi and short natural gas exposure. Agricultural commodities
and interest rates also contributed to a lesser degree, while metals and equities detracted modestly. The Fund finished with a
net loss of (1.16) , (1.28) , (1.31) , (1.39) and (1.33) for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

June 

 Equities
continued to move upward in June, with the S P 500 Index posting its best month of 2023, up +6.61 , bringing the YTD return
to up +16.89 . Bonds, however, did not fare as well with the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index continuing its slide from the
previous month, down -0.36 in June, and up +2.09 YTD. Outside traditional asset classes, commodities rose during the period,
particularly oil, which bounced following Saudi Arabia s additional production cuts. The U.S. Dollar resumed its YTD downward
trend against the backdrop of shifting investor appetite to risk on assets. 

Futures
Portfolio Fund s (the Fund positive return in June was driven by short fixed income, long equity, and short
foreign currencies. Agricultural commodities and energy products were notable detractors to performance, while metals, to a lesser
extent, also detracted during the period. The Fund finished with a net loss of (1.24) , (1.36) , (1.39) , (1.47) and (1.41) 
for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

July 

 Equities
continued to move upward in July, albeit at a slower pace, up +3.21 and bringing the YTD return up to +20.65 for the S P
500 Index. Bonds, however, did not fare as well with the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index continuing its slide from the previous
two months, down -0.07 in July, and up +2.02 YTD. Outside traditional asset classes, commodities rose during the period, particularly
oil, which bounced on tighter supply. The U.S. Dollar USD continued its downward trend this year against the backdrop
of shifting investor appetite to risk on assets. 

Futures
Portfolio Fund s return in July was driven by long USD against a basket of short foreign currencies positioning and to a
lesser extent long Asian equities. Energy trading was the largest contributor to performance over the period as long positioning
in Brent Crude benefited from the spike in prices. The Fund finished with a net loss of (1.21) , (1.10) , (1.07) , (0.99) and
(1.05) for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

August 

 Equities
fell in August, deviating from the yearlong upward trend, with the S P 500 Index falling -1.59 , bringing the YTD return to
up +18.73 . At the same time, bonds again failed to protect investor capital, with the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index selling
off -0.64 in the period and briefly moving into negative territory for 2023 before ending August up just +1.37 YTD. Negatively
impacting equity and fixed income markets was concern the Federal Reserve would continue its hawkish stance. The U.S. Dollar,
however, strengthened against the backdrop of the aforementioned potential Federal Reserve action. 

Futures
Portfolio Fund (the Fund fell modestly in August as low volatility provided limited trading opportunities for the
Fund s managers. The Fund s major sectors were mixed as stock indices, energy products, and metals detracted from
performance, while currencies and agricultural commodities, specifically wheat, were profitable. Fixed income trading was not
a significant contributor to performance over the period. The Fund finished with a net loss of (0.24) , (0.13) , (0.09) , (0.02) 
and (0.08) for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

September 

 Equities
fell in September, continuing the stumble from the previous month, with the S P 500 Index falling -4.77 , bringing the YTD
return to up +13.07 . At the same time, bonds again failed to protect investor capital, with the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond
Index selling off -2.54 in the period and moving into negative territory for 2023, down -1.21 YTD. Concerns over tighter monetary
policy for longer and the potential looming government shutdown pushed the U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield to its highest level in
more than 15 years. The U.S. Dollar, however, strengthened against the backdrop of the aforementioned potential Federal Reserve
action. 

Futures
Portfolio Fund s positive return in September was overwhelmingly driven by short bond and long energy positioning. While
metals and agricultural commodities were positive, these sectors were not a significant driver of performance. Currency and stock
indices were modest detractors to September returns. The Fund finished with a net gain of 4.25 , 4.37 , 4.40 , 4.48 and 4.42 
for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

34 

Liquidity 

There
are no known material trends, demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to
result in the Fund s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. 

Capital
Resources 

The
Fu nd intends to raise additional capital through the continued sale of
Units and does not intend to raise capital through borrowing. Due to the nature of the Fund s business, the Fund does not
contemplate making capital expenditures. The Fund does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. Redemptions,
exchanges and sales of Units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investment in futures contracts, etc.
in subsequent periods. It is not possible to estimate the amount, and therefore the impact, of future inflows and outflows funds
related to the sale and redemption of Units. There are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect,
nor any expected material changes to, the Fund s capital resource arrangements at the present time. 

Contractual
Obligations 

The
Fund does not have any contractual obligations of the type contemplated by Item 303(a)(5) of Regulation S-K. The Fund s
sole business is trading futures and forward currency contracts, both long (contracts to buy) and short (contracts to sell). 

Off-Balance
Sheet Risk 

The
term off-balance sheet risk refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on
the balance sheet, may result in future obligation or loss. The Fund trades in futures and forward currency contracts, and is
therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts
there exists a risk to the Fund that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate
volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interests positions
of the Fund at the same time, and if the trading advisors were unable to offset futures interest positions of the Fund, the Fund
could lose all of its assets and the limited partners would realize a 100 loss. The General Partner minimizes market risk through
diversification of the portfolio allocations to multiple trading advisors, and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio that rarely
exceeds 35 . 

In
addition to subjecting the Fund to market risk, upon entering into futures and forward currency contracts there is a risk that
the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to the Fund. The counterparty for futures contracts traded in the U.S.
and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the
corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one
of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing
members, as is the case with some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. 

In
the case of forward currency contracts, which are traded on the interbank market rather than on exchanges, the counterparty is
generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a group of financial institutions, thus there may be a greater
counterparty risk. The General Partner utilized only those counterparties that it believes to be creditworthy for the Fund. All
positions of the Fund are valued each day on a mark-to-market basis. There can be no assurance, however, that any clearing member,
clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to the Fund. 

The
Fund may invest in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. and foreign government sponsored enterprise notes, certificates of deposit,
commercial paper, asset backed securities and corporate notes. Should an issuing entity default on its obligation to the Fund
and such entity is not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the Fund bears the risk of loss of the amount
expected to be received. The Fund minimizes this risk by only investing in securities and certificates of deposit of firms with
high quality debt ratings. 

Significant
Accounting Policies 

A
summary of the Fund s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the financial statements. 

35 

The
Fund s most significant accounting policy is the valuation of its assets invested in U.S. and foreign futures and forward
currency contracts, fixed income instruments and investments in private investment companies. The Fund s futures contracts
are exchange-traded, with the fair value of these contracts based on exchange settlement prices. The fair values of non-exchange-traded
contracts, such as forward currency contracts, are based on third-party quoted dealer values on the interbank market. The fair
value of money market funds is based on quoted market prices for identical shares. U.S. Treasury securities are stated at fair
value based on quoted market prices for identical assets in an active market. Notes of U.S. and foreign government sponsored enterprises,
as well as commercial paper, asset backed securities and corporate notes, are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices
for similar assets in an active market. Given the valuation sources, there is little judgment or uncertainty involved in the valuation
of these assets, and it is unlikely that materially different amounts would be reported under different valuation methodologies
or assumptions. The Fund s investment in a private investment company is valued at net asset value as provided by the private
fund s administrator. This use of net asset value as the practical expedient to approximate fair value under ASC 820 is
advisable due to the investment not having a readily determinable fair value. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Introduction 

The
Fund is a speculative commodity pool. The market-sensitive instruments held by the Fund are acquired for speculative trading purposes,
and all or substantially all of the Fund s assets are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk
of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Fund s main line of business. 

Market
movements result in frequent changes in the fair market value of the Fund s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings
and cash flow. The Fund s market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of exchange
rates, interest rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects
among the Fund s open positions and the liquidity of the markets in which it trades. 

The
Fund rapidly acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it is not
possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will affect performance, and the Fund s past performance cannot be
relied on as indicative of its future results. 

Standard
of Materiality 

Materiality
as used in this section, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , is based on an assessment of reasonably
possible market movements and the potential losses caused by such movements, taking into account the leverage, and multiplier
features of the Fund s market sensitive instruments. 

Quantifying
the Fund s Trading Value at Risk 

The
following quantitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures contain forward-looking statements within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. All quantitative disclosures in this
section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact. 

Value
at Risk is a measure of the maximum amount which the Fund could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector. However,
the inherent uncertainty of the Fund s speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Fund to market movements
far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated Value at Risk or the
Fund s experience to date (i.e., risk of ruin ). Risk of ruin is defined to be no more than a 5 chance of losing 20 
or more on a monthly basis. In light of the foregoing as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections,
the inclusion of the quantification included in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation
that the Fund s losses in any market sector will be limited to Value at Risk or by the Fund s attempts to manage its market risk. 

The
Fund s risk exposure in the various market sectors traded by the Fund s Trading Advisors is quantified below in terms of
Value at Risk. Due to mark-to-market accounting, any loss in the fair value of the Fund s open positions is directly reflected
in the Fund s earnings. 

Exchange
margin requirements have been used by the Fund as the measure of its Value at Risk. Margin requirements are set by exchanges to
equal or exceed the maximum losses reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract in 95 - 99 of
any one-day interval. The margin levels are established by dealers and exchanges using historical price studies as well as an
assessment of current market volatility and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected
near-term one-day price fluctuation. 

36 

In
the case of market sensitive instruments that are not exchange-traded (includes currencies, certain energy products and metals),
the margin requirements required by the forward counterparty is used as Value at Risk. 

In
quantifying the Fund s Value at Risk, 100 positive correlation in the different positions held in each market risk category has
been assumed. Consequently, the margin requirements applicable to the open contracts have simply been aggregated to determine
each trading category s aggregate Value at Risk. The diversification effects resulting from the fact that the Fund s positions
are rarely, if ever, 100 positively correlated, have not been reflected. 

Value
at Risk as calculated herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by others. 

The
Fund s Trading Value at Risk in Different Market Sectors 

The
following table indicates the trading Value at Risk associated with the Fund s open positions by market sector at September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023. All open position trading risk exposures of the Fund have been included in calculating the figures
set forth below.

Material
Limitations on Value at Risk as an Assessment of Market Risk 

The
face value of the market sector instruments held by the Fund is typically many times the applicable margin requirement (margin
requirements generally range between 1 and 10 of contract face value) as well as many times the capitalization of the Fund.
The magnitude of the Fund s open positions creates a risk of ruin not typically found in most other investment vehicles.
Because of the size of its positions, certain market conditions unusual, but historically recurring from time to time could
cause the Fund to incur severe losses over a short period of time. The foregoing Value at Risk table as well as the past
performance of the Fund gives no indication of this risk of ruin. 

Non-Trading
Risk 

The
Fund has non-trading market risk on its foreign cash balances not needed for margin. However, these balances (as well as the market
risk they represent) are immaterial. The Fund also has non-trading market risk as a result of investing a substantial portion
of its available assets in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government sponsored enterprise notes, commercial paper, asset backed
securities and corporate notes. Although these investments are considered to be high quality, some of the securities purchased
are neither guaranteed by the U.S. government nor supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. There is some
risk that a security issuer may fail to pay the interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions about
the issuer s ability to make such payments will cause the price of these instruments to decline in value. 

Qualitative
Disclosures Regarding Primary Trading Risk Exposures 

The
following qualitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures except for those disclosures that are statements
of historical fact and the descriptions of how the Fund manages its primary market risk exposures constitute forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 1933 Act and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 1934 Act ). The Fund s primary market risk exposures as well as the strategies used and to
be used by the Fund s Trading Advisors for managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies
and risks, any one of which could cause the actual results of the Fund s risk controls to differ materially from the objectives
of such strategies. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental
factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation
and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management
strategies of the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund s current market exposure and/or risk management strategies will
not change materially or that any such strategies will be effective in either the short- or long-term. Investors must be prepared
to lose all or substantially all of their investment in the Fund. 

37 

The
following were the primary trading risk exposures of the Fund as of September 30, 2024, by market sector. 

Agricultural
Commodities 

 The
Fund takes positions in a broad range of agricultural futures, including soybeans, wheat, corn, sugar, and cotton among others.
Prices in these markets can be affected by changes in demand, as well changes in supply factors such as weather and inventory
levels. 

Currencies 

 The
Fund trades in foreign exchange markets by taking positions in currency futures and forward contracts for a large number of developed
and emerging market currencies. Exposures may take the form of direct exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, or cross-rates between
two foreign currencies. Exchange rates can be impacted by economic differences between regions (such as interest rate differentials
or economic growth differentials), political events, as well as investor risk sentiment. 

Energy

The
Fund gains trading exposure in energy markets through oil and gas futures, which include WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil, distillates
such as heating oil, and natural gas. Prices have historically been highly volatile, driven by demand side factors such as global
economic growth and weather conditions, as well as supply side factors such as Middle East conflicts, OPEC production agreements,
and shale production. 

Equity
Indices 

 The
Fund has exposure to major stock market indices around the world through equity index futures. Primary exposures are in developed
markets such as the U.S., the UK, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, but there can also be exposure to smaller developing
market stock indices. Equity index price movements can be affected by microeconomic factors such as corporate earnings, by macroeconomic
factors such as government fiscal and monetary policy, as well as by investor sentiment. 

Interest
Rate Instruments 

 The
Fund has exposure to global fixed income markets through bond futures and interest rate futures in countries such as the U.S.,
the UK, Germany, Japan and Australia. The Fund has exposure across the yield curve with positions in the futures for both short
term and long-term instruments. The yield curve (and futures prices) can be affected by economic growth, inflation expectations,
monetary policy and investor risk aversion. 

Metals 

 The
Fund has exposure to metals futures, including both precious metals such as gold, silver and platinum, as well as industrial metals
such as copper, aluminum and zinc. Metals prices can be volatile. Precious metals prices are often driven by inflation expectations,
risk aversion, and mining output. Industrial metals prices tend to be impacted by industrial demand relative to production. 

Single
Stock Futures 

 The
Fund may have a small exposure to single stock futures, with positions primarily in companies that trade on U.S. exchanges. The
price drivers here tend to be more microeconomic with corporate earnings and industry trends being important. However, macroeconomic
and market-wide factors can also affect single stock futures prices. 

Qualitative
Disclosures Regarding Non-Trading Risk Exposure 

The
following represent non-trading risk exposures of the Fund as of September 30, 2024. 

Foreign
Currency Balances 

 The
Fund s primary foreign currency balances are in euros, Japanese yen, British pounds, Australian dollars, Hong Kong dollars and
Canadian dollars. The Fund controls the non-trading risk of these balances by regularly converting these balances back into dollars
(no less frequently than once a week). 

38 

U.S.
Treasury Securities, U.S. and Foreign Government Sponsored Enterprise Notes, Commercial Paper, Corporate Notes and Asset Backed Securities. 

 Monies in excess of margin requirements are invested in fixed income instruments, including U.S. Treasury
securities, U.S. and foreign government sponsored enterprise notes, commercial paper, corporate Notes and asset backed securities.
Fluctuations in prevailing interest rates could cause mark-to-market gains or losses on the Fund's investments; although substantially
all of these investments are held to maturity. 

Qualitative
Disclosures Regarding Means of Managing Risk Exposure 

The
means by which the Fund and the Fund s trading advisors, severally, attempt to manage the risk of the Fund s open positions
is essentially the same in all market sectors traded. The Fund s trading advisors apply risk management policies to their
respective trading which generally limit the total exposure that may be taken. In addition, the trading advisors generally follow
proprietary diversification guidelines (often formulated in terms of the balanced volatility between markets and correlated groups). 

The
Fund is unaware of any (i) anticipated known demands, commitments or capital expenditures; (ii) material trends, favorable or
unfavorable, in its capital resources; or (iii) trends or uncertainties that will have a material effect on operations. From time
to time, certain regulatory agencies have proposed increased margin requirements on futures contracts. Because the Fund generally
will use a small percentage of assets as margin, the Fund does not believe that any increase in margin requirements, as proposed,
will have a material effect on the Fund s operations. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

The
General Partner, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures at September 30, 2024 (the Evaluation
Date ). Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the General Partner concluded
that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Any
control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurance that its objectives
will be met. Furthermore, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, have been detected.
