 Collateral-Dependent loans 
 Collateral-dependent loans are loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Under the CECL methodology, for collateral-dependent loans, the Company has adopted the practical expedient to measure the allowance on the fair value of collateral. 
 The allowance is calculated on an individual loan basis based on the shortfall between the fair value of the loan s collateral, which is adjusted for liquidation costs/discounts, and the loan s amortized cost. If the fair value of the collateral exceeds the loan s amortized cost, no allowance is necessary. The Company s policy is to obtain appraisals on any significant pieces of collateral. Higher discounts are applied in determining fair value for real estate collateral in industries that are undergoing significant stress, or for properties that are specialized use or have limited marketability.

 Credit Quality 
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based upon an internal rating system reflecting management s risk assessment. 
 Pass - loans that are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor (or guarantors, if any) or by the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell in a timely manner, of any underlying collateral. 
 Watch - loans that have one or more weaknesses identified that may result in the borrower being unable to meet repayment terms or when the Company s credit position could deteriorate at some future date. 
 Special Mention - loans that have negative financial trends, or other weaknesses that if left uncorrected, could threaten its capacity to meet its debt obligations. This is a transitional grade that is closely monitored by management for improvement or deterioration. 
 Substandard - loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified may have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt. Such loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company may sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 Doubtful - loans that have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified as Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently known facts, conditions, and values. These loans are also on non-accrual status. 
 Non-accrual - loans that are delinquent for 90 days or more and the ultimate collectability of interest or principal is no longer probable. Real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties are exempt from these non-accrual guidelines. These loans are placed on non-accrual status after they become 120 days past due (The majority of the Company's non-accrual loans have a substandard risk grade.)

 Loan Modifications for Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 In the normal course of business, the Company may execute loan modifications with borrowers. These modifications are analyzed to determine whether the modification is considered concessionary, long-term and made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. The Company s modifications generally include interest rate adjustments, principal reductions, and amortization and maturity date extensions. If a loan modification is determined to be made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the loan is considered collateral-dependent and evaluated as part of the allowance for credit losses as described above in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this note. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did modify any loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company monitors loan payments on an on-going basis to determine if a loan is considered to have a payment default. Determination of payment default involves analyzing the economic conditions that exist for each customer and their ability to generate positive cash flows during the loan term.

 The total available-for-sale portfolio consisted of approximately securities at September 30, 2024. The portfolio included securities having an aggregate fair value of million that were in a loss position at September 30, 2024. Securities identified as temporarily impaired which had been in a loss position for 12 months or longer totaled million at fair value at September 30, 2024. The million aggregate unrealized loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at September 30, 2024 was caused by interest rate fluctuations. 
 The decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality. In the absence of changes in credit quality of these investments, the fair value is expected to recover on all debt securities as they approach their maturity date or re-pricing date, or if market yields for such investments decline. The Company does not have the intent to sell these investments over the period of recovery, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such investment securities.

 Medical plans 401(k) match and profit sharing Periodic pension cost Other Total employee benefits 
 The Company's profit-sharing plan includes a matching 401(k) portion, in which the Company matches the first of eligible employee contributions. The Company made annual contributions for the discretionary portion in an amount up to of income before income taxes and before contributions to the profit-sharing and pension plans for all participants, limited to the maximum amount deductible for federal income tax purposes, for each of the periods shown. In addition, employees were able to make additional tax-deferred contributions. 
 Other Plans 
 On November 7, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP), effective as of January 1, 2018. The SERP provides select employees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements with certain benefits upon retirement, termination of employment or death. 
 The accrued liability relating to the SERP was million as of September 30, 2024, and the expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million and million, respectively, compared to million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and is recognized over the required service period. 
 Pension 
 The Company provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for all full-time and eligible employees. Beginning January 1, 2018 and for all retrospective periods presented, the Company adopted the guidance under ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost . Under the guidance, only the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost is reported in the same income statement line item as salaries and benefits, and the remaining components are reported as other non-interest expense. An employer is required to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. Under the Company s funding policy for the defined benefit pension plan, contributions are made to a trust as necessary to provide for current service and for any unfunded accrued actuarial liabilities over a reasonable period. To the extent that these requirements are fully covered by assets in the trust, a contribution might not be made in a particular year. 
 Effective July 1, 2017, the Company amended the pension plan to effectuate a soft freeze such that no individual hired (or rehired in the case of a former employee) by the Company after September 30, 2017, whether or not such individual is or was a vested member in the plan, will be eligible to be an active member and be entitled to accrue any benefits under the plan.

 Valuation Methods for Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
 Following is a description of the Company s valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis: 
 Collateral Dependent Impaired Loans 
 While the overall loan portfolio is not carried at fair value, the Company periodically records non-recurring adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value measurements for partial charge-offs of the uncollectible portions of those loans. Non-recurring adjustments also include certain impairment amounts for collateral dependent loans when establishing the allowance for credit losses. Such amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan. In determining the value of real estate collateral, the Company relies on external and internal appraisals of property values depending on the size and complexity of the real estate collateral. The Company maintains staff trained to perform in-house evaluations and also to review third-party appraisal reports for reasonableness. In the case of non-real estate collateral, reliance is placed on a variety of sources, including external estimates of value and judgments based on the experience and expertise of internal specialists. Values of all loan collateral are regularly reviewed by a senior loan committee. Because many of these inputs are not observable, the measurements are classified as Level 3. As of September 30, 2024, the Company identified million in collateral-dependent loans that required a million specific allowance for credit losses. Related to these loans, there were million and million in charge-offs recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the Company identified million in collateral-dependent loans that required a million specific allowance for credit losses. Related to these loans, there were and million in charge-offs recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Other Real Estate and Foreclosed Assets 
 Other real estate owned (OREO) and foreclosed assets consisted of loan collateral repossessed through foreclosure. This collateral is comprised of commercial and residential real estate and other non-real estate property, including autos, manufactured homes, and construction equipment. Subsequent to foreclosure, these assets are initially carried at fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. Fair value, when recorded, is generally based upon appraisals by approved, independent state-certified appraisers. Like impaired loans, appraisals on OREO may be discounted based on the Company s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of appraisal or other information available. During the holding period, valuations are updated periodically, and the assets may be written down to reflect a new cost basis. Because many of these inputs are not observable, the measurements are classified as Level 3.

 Subordinated notes Interest rate lock commitments Forward sale commitments Accrued interest payable 
 Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments 
 The fair value of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements, the likelihood of the counterparties drawing on such financial instruments, and the present creditworthiness of such counterparties. The Company believes such commitments have been made on terms that are competitive in the markets in which it operates. 
 Limitations 
 The fair value estimates provided are made at a point in time based on market information and information about the financial instruments. Because no market exists for a portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the fair value estimates.

 Commitments 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since certain of the commitments and letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, furniture and equipment, and real estate. 
 The Company has two types of commitments related to mortgage loans held for sale: interest rate lock commitments and forward loan sale commitments. Interest rate lock commitments are commitments to extend credit to a customer that has an interest rate lock and are considered derivative instruments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company elected not to record the derivatives associated with IRLCs due to the reduced volume of loans sold to the secondary market. 
 Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. These standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support contractual obligations of the Company s customers. The approximate remaining term of standby letters of credit ranged from to at September 30, 2024. 
 Pending Litigation 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in various legal actions incidental to the Company s past and current business activities. Based on the Company s analysis, and considering the inherent uncertainties associated with litigation, management does not believe that it is reasonably possible that these legal actions will materially adversely affect the Company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations in the near term. The Company records a loss accrual for all legal matters for which it deems a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Some legal matters, which are at early stages in the legal process, have not yet progressed to the point where a loss is deemed probable or an amount can be estimated.

Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, strategy, future performance and business of Hawthorn Bancshares, Inc., and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company", "we", "our", or "us"), including, without limitation: 
 statements that are not historical in nature, and 
 statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words believes , expects, may, will, should, could, anticipates, estimates, intends, plans, hopes or similar expressions. 
 Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to, among others, the following factors: 
 competitive pressures among financial services companies may increase significantly, 
 changes in the interest rate environment may reduce interest margins, 
 general economic conditions, either nationally or in Missouri, may be less favorable than expected and may adversely affect the quality of our loans and other assets, 
 increases in non-performing assets in the Company s loan portfolios and adverse economic conditions may necessitate increases to our provisions for credit losses, 
 costs or difficulties related to any integration of any business of the Company and its acquisition targets may be greater than expected, 
 legislative, regulatory or tax law changes may adversely affect the business in which the Company and its subsidiaries are engaged, 
 credit and market risks relating to increasing inflation, 
 economic or other disruptions caused by acts of terrorism, war or other conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the Israel-Hamas conflict, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, freezes, flooding and other man-made disasters, such as oil spills or power outages, health emergencies, epidemics or pandemics, climate changes or other catastrophic events, 
 changes may occur in the securities markets, 
 changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, and 
 technological changes, including potential cyber-security incidents and other disruptions, or innovations to the financial services industry, including as a result of the increased telework environment. 
 
 The Company has described additional factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those described in the forward-looking statements under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A. of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K"), and in other reports filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") from time to time. Other factors that have not been identified in this report could also have this effect. You are cautioned not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statement, which speak only as of the date they were made. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events, or changes in its business, results of operations or financial condition over time.

Overview 
 Crucial to the Company s community banking strategy is growth in its commercial banking services, retail mortgage lending and retail banking services. Through the branch network of its subsidiary bank, Hawthorn Bank (the "Bank"), the Company, with 1.8 billion in assets at September 30, 2024, provides a broad range of commercial and personal banking services. The Bank s specialties include commercial banking for small and mid-sized businesses, including equipment, operating, commercial real estate, Small Business Administration loans, a comprehensive suite of cash management services, and personal banking services including real estate mortgage lending, installment and consumer loans, certificates of deposit, individual retirement and other time deposit accounts, checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts. Other financial services that the Company provides include trust services that include estate planning, investment and asset management services. The geographic areas in which the Company provides products and services include the Missouri communities in and surrounding Jefferson City, Columbia, Clinton, Warsaw, Springfield, and the greater Kansas City metropolitan area. 
 The Company s primary source of revenue is net interest income derived primarily from lending and deposit taking activities. Much of the Company s business is commercial, commercial real estate development, and residential mortgage lending. The Company s income from mortgage brokerage activities is directly dependent on mortgage rates and the level of home purchases and refinancing activity. 
 The success of the Company s growth strategy depends primarily on the ability of the Bank to generate an increasing level of loans and deposits at acceptable risk levels and on acceptable terms without significant increases in non-interest expenses relative to revenues generated. The Company s financial performance also depends, in part, on its ability to manage various portfolios and to successfully introduce additional financial products and services by expanding new and existing customer relationships, utilizing improved technology, and enhancing customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the success of the Company s growth strategy depends on its ability to maintain sufficient regulatory capital levels during periods in which general economic conditions are unfavorable and despite economic conditions being beyond its control. 
 The deposit accounts of the Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") to the extent provided by law. The Bank is supervised and regulated by the FDIC and the Missouri Division of Finance. Regular examinations are conducted by representatives of these regulatory bodies. Such regulations, supervision and examinations are principally for the benefit of depositors, rather than for the benefit of shareholders. The Company is also subject to supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Certain accounting policies are considered most critical to the understanding of the Company s financial condition and results of operations. These critical accounting policies and estimates require management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Because these estimates and judgments are based on current circumstances, they may change over time or prove to be inaccurate based on actual experiences. In the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending upon the severity of such changes, the possibility of a materially different financial condition and/or results of operations could reasonably be expected. The Company has identified certain accounting policies as "critical accounting policies and estimates," consisting of those related to the allowance for credit losses, as described in the section captioned "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" incorporated by reference in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and results of Operations included in the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no changes in the Company's application of critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023.

 Results of Operations Highlights: 
 Consolidated net income of 4.6 million, or 0.66 per diluted share, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.0 million, or 77.4 , compared to 2.6 million, or 0.36 per diluted share, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the third quarter 2024, the return on average assets was 1.00 , the return on average stockholders equity was 12.87 , and the efficiency ratio was 66.2 . 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consolidated net income increased 5.3 million, or 62.6 , to 13.7 million, or 1.95 per diluted share, compared to 8.4 million, or 1.19 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the return on average assets was 1.00 , the return on average stockholders equity was 13.24 , and the efficiency ratio was 67.7 . 
 The Company continues to see a positive impact from focusing on the core business of the Bank and remains committed to expanding our products and services to the core customer base, while managing operating expenses. 
 Net interest income was 14.3 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.8 million compared to and 15.1 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. Net interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent basis ("FTE"), was 3.36 for the third quarter 2024, an increase from 3.35 for the third quarter 2023. 
 Net interest income was 43.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.1 million compared to 43.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest margin, on a FTE basis, was 3.36 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase from 3.23 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change to net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis is discussed in greater detail under the Average Balance Sheet Data and Rate and Volume Analysis sections. 
 Non-interest income was 3.8 million and 10.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.6 million and 5.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increases were primarily due to earnings on bank-owned life insurance and the gain on sale of other real estate. These changes are discussed in greater detail under the Non-interest Income and Expense section. 
 Non-interest expense was 12.0 million and 36.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 12.6 million and 37.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decreases are primarily due to operating within a unified company culture, focusing on core business lines and improving operational efficiencies. These changes are discussed in greater detail under the Non-interest Income and Expense section. 
 Balance Sheet Highlights: 
 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents decreased 39.2 million to 54.2 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 93.4 million as of December 31, 2023 and increased 26.4 million compared to 27.9 million as of September 30, 2023. The Company purchased 32.9 million securities and 35.0 million in bank-owned life insurance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See the Liquidity Management section for further discussion. 
 Loans Loans held for investment decreased 72.4 million to 1.47 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.54 billion as of December 31, 2023 and decreased 90.2 million compared to 1.56 billion as of September 30, 2023. Normal amortizing payments, unscheduled payoffs and a weaker demand for loans have contributed to the variance. 
 Asset quality Non-performing assets to total loans was 0.58 at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.53 and 0.48 at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Non-performing assets totaled 8.5 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 8.2 million and 7.4 million at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in non-performing assets in the current quarter is primarily due to a 2.0 million commercial loan relationship moving to non-accrual status and a 1.1 million commercial real estate loan that went to foreclosure during the current quarter. 
 In the third quarter 2024, the Company had net loan charge-offs of 0.6 million, or 0.04 of average loans, compared to net loan charge-offs 0.1 million, or 0.00 of average loans, in the prior year quarter. The charge-offs in the current 
 37 

quarter primarily related to one commercial real estate loan and one commercial loan relationship that were adequately reserved for in the prior quarter. 
 The allowance for credit losses was 21.9 million, or 1.50 , of loans outstanding at September 30, 2024 compared to 23.7 million, or 1.54 , of loans outstanding at December 31, 2023, and 22.5 million, or 1.44 , of loans outstanding at September 30, 2023. These changes are discussed in greater detail under the Lending and Credit Management section. 
 Deposit s Total deposits decreased 67.3 million to 1.50 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.57 billion as of December 31, 2023, and decreased 76.9 million compared to 1.58 billion as of September 30, 2023. The decrease in deposits at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily a result of a decrease in public funds partially offset by an increase in savings accounts. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances and other borrowings Total FHLB advances and other borrowings decreased 10.5 million to 96.5 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 107.0 million as of December 31, 2023, and decreased 15.5 million compared to 112.0 million as of September 30, 2023

 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Salaries 5,115 5,719 (604) (10.6) 15,756 16,763 (1007) (6.0) Employee benefits 1,424 1,405 19 1.4 4,237 4,215 22 0.5 Occupancy expense, net 843 842 1 0.1 2,364 2,437 (73) (3.0) Furniture and equipment expense 787 768 19 2.5 2,266 2,236 30 1.3 Processing, network and bank card expense 1,480 1,320 160 12.1 4,212 3,797 415 10.9 Legal, examination, and professional fees 378 499 (121) (24.2) 1,713 1,447 266 18.4 Advertising and promotion 198 375 (177) (47.2) 711 1,084 (373) (34.4) Postage, printing, and supplies 215 248 (33) (13.3) 571 621 (50) (8.1) Loan expense 126 147 (21) (14.3) 515 771 (256) (33.2) Other 1,428 1,246 182 14.6 4,258 4,401 (143) (3.2) Total non-interest expense 11,994 12,569 (575) (4.6) 36,603 37,772 (1,169) (3.1) Efficiency ratio 66.2 79.8 67.7 77.6 Number of full-time equivalent employees 268 312 268 312 
 Efficiency ratio is calculated as non-interest expense as a percent of revenue. Total revenue is calculated as net interest income plus non-interest income. 
 Total non-interest expense decreased 0.6 million, or 4.6 , to 12.0 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.6 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, and decreased 1.2 million, or 3.1 , to 36.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 37.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Salaries decreased 0.6 million, or 10.6 , to 5.1 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.7 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, and decreased 1.0 million, or 6.0 , to 15.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 16.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to planned reductions of full-time employees during the fourth quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2024. 
 44 

Legal, examination and professional fees decreased 0.1 million, or 24.2 , to 0.4 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.5 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, and increased 0.3 million, or 18.4 , to 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to legal fees related loan workouts. 
 Advertising and promotion decreased 0.2 million, or 47.2 , to 0.2 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.4 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, and decreased 0.4 million, or 34.4 , to 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in expenses was the result of a strategic decision to discontinue the Company's outsourced marketing efforts. The Company has hired internal marketing resources and by transitioning to an in-house marketing team, the Company has reduced costs. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes as reported in the consolidated financial statements was 18.7 and 18.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 16.2 and 17.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to tax-free revenues. 
 Lending and Credit Management 
 Interest earned on the loan portfolio is a primary source of interest income for the Company. Net loans represented 79.8 of total assets as of September 30, 2024 compared to 80.8 as of December 31, 2023. 
 Lending activities are conducted pursuant to an established loan policy approved by the Bank s Board of Directors. The Bank s credit review process is overseen by market loan committees with established loan approval limits. In addition, a senior loan committee reviews all credit relationships in aggregate over an established dollar amount. The senior loan committee meets weekly and is comprised of senior managers of the Bank. 
 Major classifications within the Company s held-for-investment loan portfolio as of the dates indicated is as follows:

 The Company extends credit to its local community markets through traditional real estate mortgage products. The Company does not participate in credit extension to sub-prime residential real estate markets. The Company does not lend funds for transactions defined as highly leveraged by bank regulatory authorities or for foreign loans. Additionally, the Company does not have any concentrations of loans exceeding 10 of total loans that are not otherwise disclosed in the loan portfolio composition table. 
 Risk Elements of the Loan Portfolio 
 Management, internal loan review and the senior loan committee formally review all loans in excess of certain dollar amounts (periodically established) at least annually. Loans in excess of 2.0 million in the aggregate and all adversely classified credits identified by management are reviewed by the senior loan committee. In addition, all other loans are reviewed on a risk weighted selection process. The senior loan committee reviews and reports to the Board of Directors, at scheduled meetings: past due, classified, and watch list loans in order to classify or reclassify loans as loans requiring attention, special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss. During this review, management will evaluate individual loans for expected credit losses when those loans do not share similar risk characteristics with loans evaluated using a collective (pooled) basis. If management determines that it is probable that all amounts due on a loan will not be collected under the original terms of the loan agreement, the loan is individually analyzed and in conjunction with current economic conditions and loss experience, reserves are estimated as further discussed below. 
 Loans not individually evaluated are aggregated and collectively analyzed. Management determined that segmenting loans not individually analyzed by the federal call report codes represents the most prudent way to consolidate loans by their associated risk qualities. 
 General reserves are recorded for collectively analyzed loans using a consistent methodology. Two different models are used for calculating the general reserve. The Discounted Cash Flow model considers quantitative peer group historic loss experience, forecasts over the estimated life of the loan pools, industry data, and qualitative or environmental factors, such as: lending policies and procedures; economic conditions; the nature, volume and terms of the portfolio; lending staff and management; past due loans; the loan review system; collateral values; concentrations of credit; and external factors. The Remaining Life model applies a long-term average loss rate calculated using peer data that is adjusted for qualitative or environmental factors such as those previously noted. The model used depends on the loan portfolio segment. Management believes, but there can be no assurance, that these procedures keep management informed of potential problem loans.

 (a) Non-performing loans include loans 90 days past due and accruing and non-accrual loans. 
 (b) Non-performing assets include non-performing loans and other real estate owned and repossessed assets. 
 
 Total non-performing assets were 8.5 million, or 0.58 of total loans, at September 30, 2024 compared to 8.2 million, or 0.53 of total loans, at December 31, 2023. 
 Total non-accrual loans at September 30, 2024 decreased 2.6 million, or 41.4 , to 3.7 million compared to 6.3 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in non-accrual loans was primarily due to a 1.8 million charged off commercial loan relationship and 3.5 million in commercial real estate loans that went to non-accrual status in the first quarter and proceeded to foreclosure in the second quarter and third quarter of 2024. In addition, 2.0 million in commercial loans moved to non-accrual status in the third quarter of 2024. 
 There were 0.4 million in loans past due 90 days and still accruing interest at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.1 million at December 31, 2023. Other real estate and repossessed assets were 4.4 million and 1.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There were 3.5 million and 0.04 million in non-accrual loans added to other real estate owned and repossessed assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Net Loan Charge-Offs 
 The Company s net charge-offs were 0.6 million and 2.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.1 million and 0.03 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The charge-offs in the current quarter primarily related to one commercial and one commercial real estate loan relationship that was adequately reserved for in the prior quarter. 
 Loans Held for Sale 
 The Company designates certain long-term fixed rate personal real estate loans as held for sale. Prior to September 30, 2024, these loans were initially measured at fair value under the fair value option election with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in mortgage banking income. As of September 30, 2024, loans held for sale are being carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. The loans are primarily sold to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and PennyMac and various other secondary market investors. At September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of these loans was 0.3 million compared to 3.9 million at December 31, 2023. 
 The Company generally does not retain long-term fixed rate residential mortgage loans in its portfolio. Fixed rate loans conforming to standards required by the secondary market are offered to qualified borrowers but are not funded until the Company has a non-recourse purchase commitment from the secondary market at a predetermined price. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold approximately 45.0 million of loans to investors compared to 84.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. On January 31, 2024, the Company sold its servicing portfolio and 
 49 

the balance of the serviced loans transferred on April 30, 2024. The Company was servicing approximately 226.3 million of loans sold to the secondary market at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity Management 
 The role of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available to meet depositors withdrawal and borrowers credit demands while at the same time maximizing profitability. This is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in the supply of those funds. Liquidity to meet these demands is provided by maturing assets, short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash and the ability to attract funds from external sources, principally depositors. Due to the nature of services offered by the Company, management prefers to focus on transaction accounts and full-service relationships with customers as the primary sources of funding. 
 The Company s Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO), primarily made up of senior management, has direct oversight responsibility for the Company s liquidity position and profile. A combination of daily, weekly, and monthly reports provided to management detail the following: internal liquidity metrics, composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow obligations, available pricing and market access to the financial markets for capital, and exposure to contingent draws on the Company s liquidity. 
 The Company has a number of sources of funds to meet liquidity needs on a daily basis. The Company s most liquid assets are comprised of available-for-sale investment securities, not including other debt securities, federal funds sold, and excess reserves held at the Federal Reserve. 
 (dollars in thousands) 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Other interest-bearing deposits 34,813 77,775 Certificates of deposit in other banks 1,000 Available-for-sale investment securities 203,292 188,742 Total 239,105 266,517 
 Federal funds sold and resale agreements normally have overnight maturities and are used for general daily liquidity purposes. The fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio was 203.3 million at September 30, 2024 and included an unrealized net loss of 24.7 million. The portfolio includes projected maturities and mortgage-backed securities pay-downs of approximately 4.3 million over the next twelve months, which offer resources to meet either new loan demand or reductions in the Company s borrowings. 
 The Company pledges portions of its investment securities portfolio to secure public fund deposits, federal funds purchase lines, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank, and for other purposes as required or permitted by law. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s unpledged securities in the available-for-sale portfolio totaled approximately 118.4 million and 99.5 million, respectively. 
 Total investment securities pledged for these purposes were as follows: 
 (dollars in thousands) 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Federal Reserve Bank borrowings 9,001 9,048 Other deposits 75,885 80,175 Total pledged, at fair value 84,886 89,223 
 Liquidity is available from the Company s base of core customer deposits, defined as demand, interest checking, savings, money market deposit accounts, and time deposits less than 250,000, less all brokered deposits under 250,000. At September 30, 2024, such deposits totaled 1.4 billion and represented 93.5 of the Company s total deposits. These core deposits are normally less volatile and are often tied to other products of the Company through long lasting relationships. 
 50 

Core deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows: 
 (dollars in thousands) 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Non-interest bearing demand 390,639 402,241 Interest checking 313,557 387,242 Savings and money market 498,387 459,049 Other time deposits 203,135 214,004 Total 1,405,718 1,462,536 
 Estimated uninsured deposits totaled 325.2 million, including 97.8 million of certificates of deposit, at September 30, 2024, compared to 387.1 million, including 108.1 million of certificates of deposit, at December 31, 2023. The Company had brokered deposits totaling 10,000 and 0.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Included in the uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are public fund deposits greater than 250,000 which are collateralized by the Company totaling 95.1 million and 137.7 million, respectively. 
 Other components of liquidity are the level of borrowings from third-party sources and the availability of future credit. The Company s outside borrowings are comprised of federal funds purchased, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and subordinated notes. Federal funds purchased are overnight borrowings obtained mainly from upstream correspondent banks with which the Company maintains approved credit lines. As of September 30, 2024, under agreements with these unaffiliated banks, the Bank may borrow up to 35.0 million in federal funds on an unsecured basis and 8.5 million on a secured basis. There were no federal funds purchased outstanding at September 30, 2024. The Company may periodically borrow additional short-term funds from the Federal Reserve Bank through the discount window, although no such borrowings were outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 The Bank is a member of the FHLB and has access to credit products of the FHLB. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had 96.4 million in outstanding borrowings with the FHLB. In addition, the Company has 49.5 million in outstanding subordinated notes issued to wholly-owned grantor trusts, funded by preferred securities issued by the trusts. 
 Borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows: 
 (dollars in thousands) 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Federal Home Loan Bank advances 96,425 107,000 Other borrowings 100 Subordinated notes 49,486 49,486 Total 146,011 156,486 
 The Company pledges certain assets, including loans and investment securities to the Federal Reserve Bank, FHLB, and other correspondent banks as security to establish lines of credit and to borrow from these entities. Based on the type and value of collateral pledged, the FHLB establishes a collateral value from which the Company may draw advances against this collateral. This collateral is also used to enable the FHLB to issue letters of credit in favor of public fund depositors of the Company. The Federal Reserve Bank also establishes a collateral value of assets pledged to support borrowings from the discount window. 
 51 

The following table reflects collateral value of assets pledged, borrowings, and letters of credit outstanding, in addition to the estimated future funding capacity available to the Company: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands) 
 FHLB Federal Reserve Bank Federal Funds Purchased Lines Total FHLB Federal Reserve Bank Federal Funds Purchased Lines Total Advance equivalent 421,917 8,530 35,000 465,447 425,367 8,563 35,000 468,930 Letters of credit (44,500) (44,500) (107,500) (107,500) Advances outstanding (96,425) (96,425) (107,000) (107,000) Total available 280,992 8,530 35,000 324,522 210,867 8,563 35,000 254,430 
 At September 30, 2024, loans of 720.7 million were pledged to the FHLB as collateral for borrowings and letters of credit. At September 30, 2024, investments with a market value of 9.0 million were pledged to secure federal funds purchase lines and borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 Based upon the above, management believes the Company has more than adequate liquidity, both on balance sheet and through the additional funding capacity with the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank and Federal funds purchased lines to meet future anticipated liquidity needs in both the short and long-term. 
 Sources and Uses of Funds 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 54.2 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 93.4 million at December 31, 2023. The 39.2 million decrease resulted from changes in the various cash flows produced by operating, investing, and financing activities of the Company, as shown in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash flow provided by operating activities consists mainly of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items. Operating activities provided total cash of 23.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Investing activities, consisting mainly of purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, and changes in the level of the loan portfolio, provided total cash of 19.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The cash flow primarily consisted of a 66.2 million net decrease in loans held for investment and 20.3 million proceeds from maturities and calls of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by 32.9 million in purchases of securities and 35.0 million in purchases of bank owned life insurance policies. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company repositioned its balance sheet by selling 83.7 million in book value of investment securities, with an average yield of 1.57 . 
 Financing activities used total cash of 82.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting primarily from a 34.5 million decrease in interest-bearing transaction accounts, 21.2 million decrease in time deposits, 11.6 million decrease in demand deposits and a 10.5 million net decrease in FHLB advances. 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into certain forms of off-balance sheet transactions, including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. These transactions are managed through the Company s various risk management processes. Management considers both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet transactions in its evaluation of the Company s liquidity. The Company had 335.0 million in unused loan commitments and standby letters of credit as of September 30, 2024. Although the Company s current liquidity resources are adequate to fund this commitment level, the nature of these commitments is such that the likelihood of such a funding demand is very low. 
 The Company is a legal entity, separate and distinct from the Bank, which must provide its own liquidity to meet its operating needs. The Company s ongoing liquidity needs primarily include funding its operating expenses, paying cash dividends to its shareholders and, to a lesser extent, repurchasing its shares of common stock. The Company paid cash dividends to its shareholders totaling approximately 3.7 million and 3.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A large portion of the Company s liquidity is obtained from the Bank in the form of dividends. The Bank declared 15.0 million and 9.0 million in dividends to the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling 13.8 million and 6.8 million, respectively. Subject to declaration by the Company's Board of Directors, the Company expects to continue paying quarterly cash dividends as a part of its current capital allocation 
 52 

strategy. Future dividends will be subject to the determination, declaration and discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and compliance with applicable regulatory capital requirements. 
 Pursuant to the Company's 2019 Repurchase Plan, management is given discretion to determine the number and pricing of the shares to be repurchased under the plan, as well as the timing of any such repurchases. The Company repurchased 56,692 common shares under the repurchase plan during the first nine months of 2024 at an average cost of 19.51 per share totaling 1.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, 3.9 million remained available for share repurchases pursuant to the plan. Repurchases under the plan may be effectuated in the open market, by block purchase, in privately negotiated transactions, or through other transactions managed by broker-dealers, or any combination thereof. No time limit was set for completion of share repurchases under the plan. 
 Capital Management 
 The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification of the Company and the Bank are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings, and other factors. 
 The Basel III regulatory capital reforms adopted by U.S. federal regulatory authorities (the "Basel III Capital Rules"), among other things, (i) establish the capital measure called "Common Equity Tier 1" ("CET1"), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and "Additional Tier 1 Capital" instruments meeting stated requirements, (iii) require that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to other components of capital and (iv) define the scope of the deductions/adjustments to the capital measures. 
 Additionally, the Basel III Capital Rules require that the Company maintain a 2.50 capital conservation buffer with respect to each of CET1, Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted assets, which provides for capital levels that exceed the minimum risk-based capital adequacy requirements. A financial institution with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount is subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. 
 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of CET1, Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital to average assets, each as defined in the regulations. Management believes, as of September 30, 2024, that the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. 
 Financial institutions are categorized as well capitalized or adequately capitalized, based on minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As shown in the table below, the Company s capital ratios exceeded the regulatory definition of adequately capitalized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Based upon the information in its most recently filed call report, the Bank met the capital ratios necessary to be well-capitalized. The regulatory authorities can apply changes in classification of assets and such changes may retroactively subject the Company to changes in capital ratios. Any such change could reduce one or more capital ratios below well-capitalized status. In addition, a change may result in imposition of additional assessments by the FDIC or could result in regulatory actions that could have a material effect on our condition and results of operations. In addition, bank holding companies generally are required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 . 
 Because the Bank had less than 15.0 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, the Company is allowed to continue its trust preferred securities, all of which were issued prior to May 19, 2010, as Tier 1 capital. 
 53 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company met all capital adequacy requirements and had regulatory capital ratios in excess of the levels established for well-capitalized institutions, as shown in the following table as the dates indicated:

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Asset/Liability and Interest Rate Risk 
 Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for managing interest rate risk and employing risk management policies that monitor and limit this exposure. Interest rate risk is measured using net interest income simulations and market value of portfolio equity analyses. These analyses use various assumptions, including the nature and timing of interest rate changes, yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, and reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows. 
 The principal objective of the Company s asset and liability management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk within the balance sheet and pursue a controlled assumption of interest rate risk while maximizing earnings and preserving adequate levels of liquidity and capital. The asset and liability management function is under the guidance of the ALCO with direction from the Board of Directors. The ALCO meets quarterly to review the sensitivity of the Company s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes and to discuss local and national market conditions. The ALCO also reviews the liquidity, capital, deposit mix, loan mix and investment positions of the Company. 
 Instantaneous parallel rate shift scenarios are modeled and utilized to evaluate risk and establish exposure limits for acceptable changes in net interest margin. These scenarios, known as rate shocks, simulate an instantaneous change in interest rates and use various assumptions, including, but not limited to, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability cash flows. 
 Management analyzes the economic value of equity as a secondary measure of interest rate risk. This is a complementary measure to net interest income where the calculated value is the result of the market value of assets less the market value of liabilities. The economic value of equity is a longer term view of interest rate risk because it measures the present value of the future cash flows. The impact of changes in interest rates on this calculation is analyzed for the risk to our future earnings and is used in conjunction with the analyses on net interest income. 
 The table below illustrates the impact of an immediate and sustained 200 and 100 basis point increase and a 200 and 100 basis point decrease in interest rates on net interest income based on the interest rate risk model at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Change in projected net interest income Hypothetical shift in interest rates September 30, December 31, (bps) 2024 2023 200 (1.48) (1.57) 100 (0.59) (0.38) (100) (0.20) 0.51 (200) (1.60) 0.49 
 The change in the Company s interest rate risk exposure from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was due to moderately higher rates on interest bearing assets projected to reprice in the next 12 months and projected repricing speeds on interest bearing assets and liabilities. In an immediate and sustained shock, interest bearing assets and liabilities are projected to reprice at relatively the same pace. Management believes the change in projected net interest income from interest rate shifts of up 200 bps and down 200 bps is an acceptable level of interest rate risk. 
 Many assumptions are used to calculate the impact of interest rate fluctuations. Actual results may be significantly different than our projections due to several factors, including the timing and frequency of rate changes, market conditions and the shape of the yield curve. The computations of interest rate risk shown above do not include actions that management may undertake to manage the risks in response to anticipated changes in interest rates and actual results may also differ due to any actions taken in response to the changing rates. 
 55 

Effects of Inflation 
 The effects of inflation on financial institutions are different from the effects on other commercial enterprises since financial institutions make few significant capital or inventory expenditures, which are directly affected by changing prices. Because bank assets and liabilities are virtually all monetary in nature, inflation does not affect a financial institution as much as do changes in interest rates. The general level of inflation does underlie the general level of most interest rates, but interest rates do not increase at the rate of inflation as do prices of goods and services. Rather, interest rates react more to changes in the expected rate of inflation and to changes in monetary and fiscal policy. 
 Inflation does have an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry, often resulting in a need to increase capital at higher than normal rates to maintain an appropriate capital to asset ratio. In the opinion of management, inflation did not have a significant effect on the Company s operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our Company s management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) or 15d 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of September 30, 2024. Based upon and as of the date of that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were designed, and were effective, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. It should be noted that any system of disclosure controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any system of disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of any such system, there can be no assurance that any design will always succeed in achieving its stated goals under all circumstances. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Impact of New Accounting Standards 
 Income Taxes. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU requires that public business entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. The ASU requires that all entities disclose on an annual basis (1) the amount of income taxes paid, disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and (2) the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid is equal or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid. The ASU also requires that all entities disclose (1) income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic or foreign and (2) income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal (national), state and foreign. This ASU is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not expect adoption of the ASU to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 Segment disclosures. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures which requires enhanced disclosures on both an annual and interim basis about significant segment expenses, including for companies with only one reportable segment. This ASU is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

 Pursuant to the Company's 2019 Repurchase Plan, management is given discretion to determine the number and pricing of the shares to be repurchased by the Company from time to time, as well as the timing of any such repurchases. The Company repurchased 5,000 common shares under the repurchase plan during the third quarter at an average cost of 19.93 per share totaling 0.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, 3.9 million remained available for share repurchases pursuant to the plan. 
 
 The Company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders and repurchase shares is affected by the Company's financial condition and liquidity, general corporate law requirements and the regulations and policies of U.S. federal regulatory authorities applicable to bank holding companies, including the Basel III Capital Rules. The Company's principal source of funds to pay dividends on its common stock and to repurchase shares, other than further issuances of securities, is dividends received from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company depends on the earnings and financial condition of the Bank and various business considerations. In addition, the Bank is subject to federal and state laws limiting the payment of dividends, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Missouri banking law. Future dividends declared and paid by the Company are subject to the determination, declaration and discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and compliance with applicable regulatory capital requirements.
