Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of per share, subject to adjustment per the warrant agreements. The warrants will expire on February 12, 2026 or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company recognizes the change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the number of exercises and the amount reclassified into equity upon the exercise of the Public Warrants and Private Warrants were not significant. The Company measures its Public Warrants using Level 1 fair value inputs based on quoted prices in active markets for the Public Warrants. Because any transfer of Private Warrants from the initial holder of the Private Warrants would result in the Private Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants, management determined that the fair value of each Private Warrant is the same as that of a Public Warrant. Accordingly, the Company measures its Private Warrants using Level 2 fair value inputs based on quoted prices in active markets for the Public Warrants.

 of the number of outstanding shares of common stock as of January 1, 2024. Stock Option Activity The following table summarizes the changes in the Company s outstanding stock options: Granted Exercised Forfeited ) Outstanding at September 30, 2024 Generally, each award vests based on continued service per the award agreement. The grant date fair value of the award is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period. The grant date fair value was determined using similar methods and assumptions as those previously disclosed by the Company. Restricted Stock Unit Activity The following table summarizes the changes in the Company s outstanding restricted stock units RSUs ): Granted Vested ) Forfeited ) Outstanding at September 30, 2024 Generally, each award vests based on continued service per the award agreement. The grant date fair value of the award is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period. The grant date fair value was determined based on the fair market value of the Company s Class A common stock on the grant date. Included in the table above are market-based RSUs granted in 2023 and 2024 that include a service condition. The market-based conditions for these awards are objective metrics related to the Company s stock price defined in the award agreement. The service condition for these awards is satisfied by providing service to the Company through the achievement date of the market-based conditions. The grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the derived service period. The grant date fair value and derived service period were determined by using a Monte Carlo simulation with similar risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility assumptions as those used by the Company for determining the grant date fair value of its stock options. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company s 2024 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP was approved by the Board and the Company s stockholders in the second quarter of 2024, with million shares of common stock initially reserved and available for issuance. Under the ESPP, each eligible employee is granted an option to purchase shares of common stock, with the purchase price paid through payroll deductions, subject to the plan s limitations on the number and value of shares purchasable. Each offering period under the ESPP has an expected duration of months, divided into four purchase periods, with purchases occurring in June and December. The purchase price per share is equal to the lower of of the closing market price on the first day of the offering period, or of the closing market price on the applicable purchase date. Proceeds received from the issuance of shares are credited to stockholders equity in the period that the shares are issued. The grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period. The grant date fair value was determined using similar methods and assumptions as those used

 million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total lease cost was million and million, respectively. Total lease cost was primarily composed of operating lease costs. Purchase Commitments: The Company enters into inventory purchase commitments with third-party manufacturers in the ordinary course of business, including a non-cancellable inventory supply agreement with a certain third-party manufacturing vendor. The provisions of the agreement allowed the Company, once it reached a certain cumulative purchase threshold in the fourth quarter of 2021, to pay for a portion of the subsequent inventory purchases using an advance previously paid to the vendor. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of minimum inventory purchase commitments is million, and the Company has a vendor advance asset of million, net of write-downs, and an accrued purchase commitment liability of million related to the agreement. The portion of the balances that is expected to be utilized in the next 12 months is included in current assets and current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company applied the guidance in Topic 330, Inventory to assess the purchase commitment and related loss, using such factors as Company-specific forecasts which are reliant on the Company s limited sales history, agreement-specific provisions, macroeconomic factors, and market and industry trends. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not recognize any additions to the accrued purchase commitment liability, or any related losses, based on its purchase commitment assessment as there were no significant changes to the assessment factors. The Company reviews its inventory on hand, including inventory acquired under the purchase commitments, for excess and obsolescence E O on a quarterly basis. Any E O inventory acquired that was previously accounted for as a purchase commitment liability accrual or vendor advance write down is recorded at zero value. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not acquire a significant amount of such E O inventory. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company utilized million of the accrued purchase commitment liability and million of the vendor advance that was previously written down to acquire such E O inventory. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company utilized million of the accrued purchase commitment liability and million of the vendor advance that was previously written down to acquire such E O inventory. Contingencies The Company is involved in litigation and legal matters from time to time, which have arisen in the normal course of business. Although the ultimate results of these matters are not currently determinable, management does not expect that they will have a material effect on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive loss, or statements of cash flows. The Company accrues an estimated liability for legal contingencies when the Company considers a potential loss probable and can reasonably estimate the amount of the potential loss. On February 16, 2022, a putative class action lawsuit, styled Rose v. Butterfly Network, Inc., et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The claims are against the Company and certain of its directors and previous management as well as Longview and members of its then board of directors, alleging that the defendants made false and misleading statements and/or omissions about its post-Business Combination business and financial prospects. The alleged class consists of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company s stock between January 12, 2021 and November 15, 2021, persons who exchanged Longview shares for the Company s common stock, and persons who purchased Longview stock pursuant, or traceable to, the Proxy/Registration Statement filed with the SEC on November 27, 2020 or any amendment thereto. The Company intends to vigorously defend against this action. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, together with interest thereon, as well as the costs and expenses of litigation. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in the defense of the litigation or that insurance will be available or

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Overview We are an innovative digital health business transforming care through a unique combination of portable, semiconductor-based ultrasound technology, intuitive software, services and educational offerings that can make medical imaging more accessible than ever before. Butterfly s solution enables the practical application of ultrasound information into the clinical workflow through affordable hardware that fits in a healthcare professional s pocket and is paired with cloud-connected software that is easily accessed through a mobile application. Butterfly iQ+ and iQ3 are ultrasound devices that can perform whole-body imaging in a single handheld probe using semiconductor technology. Our Ultrasound-on-Chip makes ultrasound more accessible outside of large healthcare institutions, while our software is intended to make the product easy to use, fully integrated with the clinical workflow, and accessible on a user s smartphone, tablet, and almost any hospital computer system connected to the Internet. We aim to enable the delivery of imaging information anywhere at point-of-care to drive earlier detection throughout the body and remote management of health conditions. We market and sell the Butterfly system, which includes probes, related accessories, and software subscriptions, to healthcare systems, physicians, and healthcare providers through a direct sales force, distributors, and our eCommerce channel. Since 2022, we have taken significant actions to reduce our cost of operations and extend our cash runway and have reduced our annual cash requirements by approximately 180 million, to less than 50 million annually. As such, we conservatively expect our cash to last into 2027. As we look forward, we expect to continue to invest in our business in order to grow revenue. Before we reach 2027, we may need to raise capital in order to reach profitability. We will first seek nondilutive capital in the form of licensing, grants, or debt and then potentially in the form of equity securities. Key Performance Measures We review the key performance measures discussed below to evaluate the business and measure performance, identify trends, formulate plans, and make strategic decisions. Our key performance measures may fluctuate over time as the adoption of our devices increases, which may shift the revenue mix more toward software and other services. The quarterly metrics may be impacted by the timing of device sales. Units fulfilled We define units fulfilled as the number of devices whereby control is transferred to a customer. We do not adjust this measure for returns as our volume of returns has historically been low. We view units fulfilled as a key indicator of the growth of our business. We believe that this metric is useful to investors because it presents our core growth and the performance of our business period over period.

 Units fulfilled increased by 1,249 units, or 36.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was led by international where distributor volume more than quadrupled year-over-year from the onboarding of several new distribution territories in the current year. In the U.S., volume increased across all sales channels. Software and other services mix We define software and other services mix as a percentage of our total revenue recognized in a reporting period that is based on software subscriptions and other related services, consisting primarily of our software as a service SaaS offering. We view software and other services mix as a key indicator of the profitability of our business, and thus we believe that this measure is useful to investors. Software and other services mix decreased by 9.0 percentage points, to 34.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Although our software and other services revenue increased in the current year, our software and other services mix decreased due to the even larger increase in product revenue realized in the current year.

 Description of Certain Components of Financial Data Revenue Revenue consists of revenue from the sale of products, such as medical devices and accessories, and the sale of software and related services, classified as software and other services revenue on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, which are SaaS subscriptions and product support and maintenance Support ). SaaS subscriptions include licenses for teams and individuals as well as enterprise-level subscriptions. For sales of products, revenue is recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control to the customer. SaaS subscriptions and Support are generally related to stand-ready obligations and are recognized ratably over time. Over time, as adoption of our devices increases through further market penetration and as practitioners in the Butterfly network continue to use our devices, we expect our annual revenue mix to shift more toward software and other services. The quarterly revenue mix may be impacted by the timing of device sales. In 2024, due to the launch of our next generation iQ3 device, we are expecting our software and other services as a percentage of total revenue to remain flat or decrease. To date, we have invested heavily in building out our direct salesforce, with the ultimate goal of growing adoption at large-scale healthcare systems. As we expand our healthcare system software offerings and develop relationships with larger healthcare systems, we continue to expect a higher proportion of our sales in healthcare systems compared to eCommerce. Cost of revenue Cost of product revenue consists of product costs including manufacturing costs, personnel costs and benefits, inbound freight, packaging, warranty replacement costs, payment processing fees, and inventory obsolescence and write-offs. We expect our cost of product revenue to fluctuate over time due to the level of units fulfilled in any given period and fluctuate as a percentage of product revenue over time as our focus on operational efficiencies in our supply chain may be offset by increased prices of certain inventory components. Cost of software and other services revenue consists of personnel costs, cloud hosting costs, and payment processing fees. Because the costs and associated expenses to deliver our SaaS offerings are less than the costs and associated expenses of manufacturing and selling our device, we anticipate an improvement in profitability and margin expansion over time as our revenue mix shifts increasingly towards software and other services. We plan to continue to invest additional resources to expand and further develop our SaaS and other service offerings. Research and development Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and benefits, facilities-related expenses and depreciation, fabrication services, and software costs. Most of our research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services that have not reached the point of commercialization and improving our products and services that have been commercialized. Fabrication services include certain third-party engineering costs, product testing, and test boards. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in our product and software development, clinical, and regulatory capabilities. Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and benefits, advertising, conferences and events, facilities-related expenses, and software costs. We expect to increase our investments in our sales capabilities. General and administrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and benefits, insurance, patent fees, software costs, facilities-related expenses, and outside services. Outside services consist of professional services, legal fees, and other professional fees.

 Other Operating expenses classified as other are expenses which we do not consider representative of our ongoing operations. These other expenses primarily consist of employee severance and benefits costs related to our reductions in force, global workforce optimization, litigation costs, and legal settlements. Results of Operations We operate as a single reportable segment to reflect the way our CODM reviews and assesses the performance of the business. The accounting policies are described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Software and other services revenue increased by 0.4 million, or 5.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by higher enterprise software revenue and increased licensing revenue from our Butterfly Garden and Powered by Butterfly partnerships, partially offset by lower renewals of individual subscriptions. Enterprise as a percentage of software revenue increased by approximately 5 percentage points year-over-year. Cost of revenue

This increase was primarily driven by higher devices sales in the current year. This increase was further driven by a higher warranty accrual and related expenses and increased royalties and payment processing fees all associated with higher device sales. Cost of software and other services revenue increased by 0.2 million, or 7.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, largely due to increased software amortization expense.

This increase was primarily driven by higher product revenue across nearly all sales channels, including the impact of our iQ3 probe s higher selling price as well as an increase in probe sales internationally. The increase in product revenue was negatively impacted by two large grant-based deployments to medical schools that occurred in the prior year and did not repeat in 2024. Excluding the prior-year large medical school deployments, product revenue increased 44.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Software and other services revenue increased by 0.7 million, or 3.7 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by higher enterprise software revenue, higher revenue from medical school subscriptions, and increased licensing revenue from our Butterfly Garden and Powered by Butterfly partnerships, partially offset by lower renewals of individual subscriptions.

This decrease was primarily driven by reductions of 7.4 million of employee severance and benefits costs related to our reduction in forces in the prior year and 6.8 million in legal costs due to litigation and other legal matters. These costs are not representative of our ongoing operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since our inception, our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, proceeds from the Business Combination, and issuances of preferred stock and convertible notes. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses, working capital requirements, and capital expenditures. The Company has incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities in each year since inception, and we expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows for a few years as we continue to commercialize existing and new products and services. We expect that our existing cash 

 25 

Table of Contents 
 and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity, capital expenditure, and anticipated working capital requirements and fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company utilized 8.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. In the third quarter, we paid 0.4 million of legal payments due to litigation and other legal matters. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balance was 93.8 million. Our future spending on capital resources may vary from those currently planned and will depend on various factors, including our rate of revenue growth and the timing and extent of spending on strategic business initiatives. As of September 30, 2024, we have restricted cash of 4.0 million to secure a letter of credit for one of our leases, which is expected to be maintained as a security deposit for the duration of the lease. Our material cash requirements include contractual obligations with third parties for office leases, technology licensing agreements, and inventory supply agreements. Our fixed office lease payment obligations were 28.9 million as of September 30, 2024, with 3.6 million payable within the next 12 months. Our fixed technology license payment obligations were 15.5 million as of September 30, 2024, with 1.5 million payable within the next 12 months. Our fixed purchase obligations for inventory supply agreements were 8.6 million as of September 30, 2024, all of which is payable within the next 12 months and approximately 20 of which we expect to pay using vendor advances. As of September 30, 2024, we had no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. Cash flows Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (38,587) (85,719) Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (2,250) 72,926 Net cash provided by financing activities 228 Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (40,837) (12,565) Net cash used in operating activities Net cash used in operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to our activities other than investing and financing activities. We expect cash provided by historical financing activities will continue to be our primary source of funds to support operating and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. Net cash used in operating activities decreased by 47.1 million, or 55.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by reductions of 36.9 million in net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items and 10.2 million in net working capital cash usage. The decrease in net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items was primarily driven by a reduction of 35.2 million in net loss. The decrease in net working capital cash usage was primarily driven by reductions of 18.7 million in cash used for changes in our inventory and the related vendor advances and accrued purchase commitments, 1.1 million in cash used for changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and 0.9 million in cash used for changes in deferred revenue. These reductions were partially offset by an 8.9 million increase in cash used for changes in accounts receivable and a 1.7 million decrease in cash provided by changes in our prepaid expenses and other assets. Net cash used in investing activities Net cash provided by investing activities decreased by 75.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of our marketable securities in 2023.

Table of Contents 
 Net cash provided by financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We did not have any significant financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and these form the basis for making judgments about items that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements The Company did not identify any significant recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We did not have any floating rate debt as of September 30, 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of bank deposits and money market accounts. The primary objective of our investments is the preservation of capital to fulfill liquidity needs. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the short-term nature and low risk profile of these investments, we do not expect cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates, including an immediate change of 100 basis points, or one percentage point. Declines in interest rates, however, would reduce future investment income. Inflation Risk We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, other than its impact on the general economy. Nonetheless, to the extent our costs are impacted by general inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases or manufacturing efficiencies. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Foreign Exchange Risk We operate our business primarily within the United States and currently execute the majority of our transactions in U.S. dollars. We have not utilized hedging strategies with respect to such foreign exchange exposure. This limited foreign currency translation risk is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company s reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Operating Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Operating Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

August 20, 2024 Steve Cashman Dear Steve, Pending approval from Butterfly Network s Compensation Committee , we are pleased to offer you a position of Executive Vice-President, Chief Business Officer as soon as practical. You will report to Joe DeVivo, Chief Executive Officer. Your annualized compensation in this position will consist of an annual base salary of 525,000 paid in biweekly pay periods, less required deductions. You are eligible to receive an annual discretionary bonus with a target of 70 based on goals, objectives, and performance metrics to be determined by Butterfly Network s management, prorated for 2024. It will be a condition of your eligibility to receive any bonus that you remain employed with Butterfly Network through the scheduled date of payment of such bonus. In addition to the outlined cash compensation, you will receive 1,000,000 restricted stock units (RSUs) of Butterfly Network, that will be subject to (i) the approval of Butterfly Network s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, (ii) the terms and conditions of a grant agreement entered into by you and Butterfly, and (iii) your continued service with the Company. Your RSUs will vest over a three-year period. You will also receive 1,000,000 performance share units (Initial PSUs) subject to vesting upon the achievement of specified performance metrics described in this paragraph. The Initial PSU Grant shall vest as follows: 1/3 shall vest upon the achievement of a price for the Common Stock (the Share Price equal to or exceeding 2.00 per share, 1/3 shall vest upon the achievement of the Share Price equal to or exceeding 3.00, the final 1/3 shall vest upon the achievement of the Share Price equal to or exceeding 4.00, in each case, the closing stock price for 20 consecutive trading days (each, a 20-Day Consecutive Share Price must equal or exceed the Share Price targets, and provided such Share Price is achieved prior to the fifth (5th) anniversary of the grant date of such Initial PSU Grant (each, an Initial PSU Grant Vesting Date ). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision in the Agreement or 2020 Plan to the contrary, in the event of a Change of Control prior to an applicable Initial PSU Grant Vesting Date, the portion of the Initial PSUs that have achieved the applicable Share Price targets set forth in the Initial PSU Grant shall vest in accordance with the achievement of the applicable 20-Day Consecutive Share Price as described in this paragraph, except the applicable price per share in the applicable Change of Control transaction, as determined by the Board in its discretion, shall be substituted for the applicable 20-Day Consecutive Share Price to determine the number of Initial Grant PSUs that shall vest upon such a Change of Control. For the avoidance of doubt, any Initial PSUs that have not vested in accordance with this paragraph by such Change of Control shall be forfeited. The Executive must continue to have a service relationship with the Company on the applicable vesting dates to vest in any shares in the Initial Equity Grants. This is a summary only. The Initial Equity Grants shall be subject to, and governed by, the terms and conditions of the Company s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, as may be amended or restated from time to time (the 2020 Plan ), and the applicable equity award agreements (collectively, the Equity Documents ). You will receive a one-time taxable payment of 150,000.00 in your first payroll check, as a sign on bonus. The sign-on bonus is not earned unless or until you have remained employed for 12 months from the start date. Such payment will be recoverable in full by the company in the event you voluntarily terminate your employment prior to 12 months from your start date (whether such voluntary termination occurs on, before, or after your start date). You will be based out of your home office in Ohio. 

Butterfly Network recognizes the need for employees to take time away from the office to creatively recharge. We also believe in taking personal responsibility for managing our own time, workload and results. For these reasons our Flexible Paid Time Off (FPTO) policy affords eligible employees the flexibility to be given an indeterminate amount of paid time off from work for vacation, personal or family obligations and other personal requirements, subject to the requirements of the policy, including advance notice and prior approval in Butterfly Network s discretion. In no event will any employee be compensated for unused vacation time. You will also be eligible to participate in medical and other benefit plans in accordance with the rules and eligibility of those plans currently in effect. Health insurance shall commence on your start date. Further, while we expect you to remain with Butterfly Network for a long time, this letter is not an employment contract and you will be an at-will employee and will be entitled to benefits under the executive severance plan as an executive vice-president. You may be a member of up to three outside boards of directors, subject to approval by the Chief Executive Officer. This letter is subject to successful completion of a background check and upon the completion of references. By signing this letter, you authorize Butterfly Network to conduct such background check. Butterfly Network considers the protection of its confidential information, proprietary materials and goodwill to be extremely important. As a condition of this offer of employment, you are required to sign Butterfly Network s Non-competition/Non-solicit, Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Agreement. Butterfly Network expects all employees to act ethically, legally and compliantly. Accordingly, all employees are expected to be familiar with and comply with its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which can be viewed on Butterfly Network s website. Sincerely, Butterfly Network, Inc.
