 NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SINCE INCEPTION ON FEBRUARY 21, 2022 TO OCTOBER
31, 2024 

, and a net loss of for the three months
ended October 31, 2024. The Company has Promissory Notes on a balance sheet of at October 31, 2024. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company is attempting to commence operations
and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support the Company s daily
operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering. While the Company believes in the viability
of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances
to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement
its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments
related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The extent of the impact of the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak on the financial performance of the Company will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak
and related advisories and restrictions and the impact of COVID-19 on the overall economy, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot
be predicted. If the overall economy is impacted for an extended period, the Company s future operating results may be materially
adversely affected. 

The Company s year-end is April 30. 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP and with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and notes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements of the Company. In the opinion of management, these financial statements
reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s financial position, results
of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented in conformity with US GAAP. These unaudited consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended April 30, 2024. Interim
results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year or any other interim period.

Change in valuation allowance 

Tax benefit (expenses), net 

The tax effects of temporary differences that
give rise to significant portions of the net deferred tax assets are as follows: 

Valuation allowance 

Deferred tax assets, net 

The Company has accumulated approximately 
of net operating losses NOL carried forward to offset future taxable income up to 20 years, if any, in future years which
begin to expire in year 2038. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers
the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs
for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not
historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified
by the use of terms such as "August," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate,"
"approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to
the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what April occurs in the future.
However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual
results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected.
We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 

Employees
and Employment Agreements 

At present, we have no employees other than our
officer and director. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans;
however, we August adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers, directors or employees. 

Results of Operation 

Our financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of
assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

We expect we will require additional capital to
meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt
securities. 

Three Months Ended October 31, 2024: 

During the three and six months ended October
31, 2024, we have generated 3,000 and 3,000 revenue. 

Our net loss for the three and six months ended
October 31, 2024 was 2,683 and 17,479. Operating expenses consist of mainly professional fees, consulting expenses and depreciation expenses. 

During the three and six months ended October
31, 2023, we have generated 6,000 and 18,920 revenue. 

Our net loss for the three and six months ended
October 31, 2023 was 1,437 and 2,097. Operating expenses consist of mainly professional fees, consulting expenses and depreciation expenses.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

We have generated positive cash flows from investing
activities. For six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, net cash flows used in investing activities was 4,302 for both periods. 

Plan of Operation and Funding 

We expect that working capital requirements will
continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements
are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

14 

Existing working capital, further advances and
debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no
lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private
placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating
expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business;
and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter,
we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances
of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing August not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If
adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we August not be able to take advantage of prospective new
business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise
additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of
how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale
of our common stock. We have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although no future arrangement for
additional loans has been made. We do not have any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements
in place for any future equity financing. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do
not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to investors. 

Going Concern 

The financial statements have been prepared "assuming
that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments
in the ordinary course of business. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

No report required. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of October 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was
no change in our internal control over financial reporting since Inception on February 21, 2022 ended October 31, 2024 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
