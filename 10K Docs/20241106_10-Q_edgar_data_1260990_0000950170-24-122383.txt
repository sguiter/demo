million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, no debt and an accumulated deficit of million. In connection with the Company s September 12, 2024 announcement regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives as well as the capital required for continuing development efforts, the Company has discontinued the clinical development of ONCT-534 and ONCT-808, while certain nonclinical research and manufacturing activities continue. As a result, the Company will continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with clinical trial closing costs and the completion of its nonclinical and manufacturing projects. From its inception, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. The Company has concluded that the balance of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will not be sufficient to fund its planned expenditures and meet its obligations for the twelve months following the financial statement issuance date without raising additional funding, liquidating assets, or making changes to its operating plans or programs to reduce expenses. As a result, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months following the issuance date of these financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company expects to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. The Company may seek additional funding to support its evaluation or implementation of strategic alternatives, which may be through a combination of public or private equity or debt offerings or other sources, including potential collaborations, strategic alliances and other similar licensing arrangements in both the short term and long term. If the Company is unable to secure adequate additional funding, the Company may be unable to consummate a strategic transaction and it may decide to pursue a dissolution or liquidation. As of April 2, 2024, the Company s at-the-market ATM equity offering program expired. Through April 2, 2024, the Company had sold shares of common stock for net proceeds of million under the ATM program.

per share for 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer complied with the minimum bid price requirement pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Requirement ). On January 8, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock (the Reverse Stock Split ). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the Company regained compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. Each of the Company s shareholders received one new share of common stock for every 20 shares such shareholder held immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split affected all the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock equally. The par value and authorized shares of the Company's common stock was not adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split also affected the Company s outstanding common stock options and warrants, and resulted in the shares underlying such instruments being reduced and the exercise price being increased proportionately. Unless otherwise noted, all common stock shares, common stock per share data, common stock options and warrants included in these financial statements, including the exercise price of such equity instruments, as applicable, have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented.

impairment charges on short-term investments. The Company obtains the fair value of its available-for-sale marketable securities from a professional pricing service. The fair values of available-for-sale marketable securities are validated by comparing the fair values reported by the professional pricing service to quoted market prices or to fair values obtained from the custodian bank. The service provider values the securities using a hierarchical security pricing model that relies primarily on valuations provided by an industry-recognized valuation service or mathematical calculations. Such valuations may be based on trade prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or valuation models using inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs), such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, yield curves, credit spreads, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt, as well as other relevant economic measures.

The Company determined there were no other-than-temporary declines in the value of any available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. All the Company s available-for-sale marketable securities mature within one year. The Company has allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

On April 18, 2022, the Company entered into a sublease agreement for office space which expired on . Base rent under such sublease was approximately annually and the monthly rent expense was recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. On May 9, 2023, the Company entered into a lease agreement for the same office space which expires on . Base rent under such lease is approximately annually and the monthly rent expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the effective term of the lease. The lease is included in the accompanying balance sheet at the present value of the lease payments. As such lease does not have an implicit interest rate, the present value reflects a discount rate which is the estimated rate of interest that the Company would have to pay in order to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term and in a similar economic environment. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has an operating lease right-of-use asset of and a lease liability of , with a weighted average remaining lease term of year.

 Cautionary Statement Recent Developments 
 Notification of Strategic Alternatives Evaluation 
 On September 12, 2024, we announced that our Board decided to discontinue our clinical trials evaluating ONCT-534 and ONCT-808 as well as all other product development activities, and to begin exploring strategic alternatives to maximize the value of our assets for our stockholders. We commenced a reduction-in-force beginning in September 2024, and will continue to assess further cost reduction measures as our operational and strategic direction evolves. As part of the review of strategic alternatives, we may consider options such as asset sales or out-licensing opportunities for existing programs and merger, reverse merger or other business combination opportunities. There can be no assurance any transaction will result from our evaluation of strategic alternatives. 
 We caution that trading in our securities is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Trading prices for our securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual value realized, if any, by holders of our securities. Accordingly, we urge caution with respect to existing and future investments in our securities.

 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel oncology therapies for patients with cancers with critical unmet medical need. Oncternal pursues drug development targeting promising, yet untapped biological pathways implicated in cancer generation or progression, focusing on prostate cancer and hematological malignancies. Our pipeline includes: 
 ONCT-534 is an investigational dual-action androgen receptor inhibitor (DAARI) product candidate with a novel mechanism of action that includes inhibition of androgen receptor (AR) function and degradation of the AR protein mediated by interaction with both the ligand binding domain (LBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of the AR. ONCT-534 has demonstrated preclinical activity in prostate cancer models against both unmutated AR, and against multiple forms of AR alteration, including those with AR amplification, mutations in the AR LBD, and splice variants with loss of the AR LBD. ONCT-534 is a potential monotherapy treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer and other AR-driven diseases, including relapsed or refractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC. ONCT-534 was evaluated in Study ONCT-534-101 (NCT05917470), a Phase 1/2, single-arm, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of ONCT-534 in patients with mCRPC 

20 

who have relapsed or are refractory to approved androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) including enzalutamide, abiraterone, apalutamide and darolutamide. 

ONCT-808, our lead cell therapy product candidate, is an investigational autologous chimeric antigen receptor T, or CAR T, cell therapy that targets Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-Like Orphan Receptor 1 (ROR1) using a binding moiety derived from zilovertamab, as defined below. ONCT-808 has demonstrated activity in preclinical models against multiple hematological malignancies and solid tumors and has been shown to be specific for cancer cells expressing ROR1. We have developed a robust and reproducible manufacturing process that has the potential to reduce the time patients must wait for their individual CAR T therapy to be produced, compared with currently approved CAR T products. ONCT-808 was evaluated in Study ONCT-808-101 (NCT05588440), a Phase 1/2 study in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma, including patients who have failed previous CD19 CAR T treatment. 

Zilovertamab is an investigational, humanized, potentially first-in-class, monoclonal antibody designed to: (i) bind to ROR1, a growth factor receptor that is widely expressed on many tumor and that activates pathways leading to increased tumor proliferation, invasiveness and drug resistance, and (ii) inhibit ROR1 function. Zilovertamab was evaluated in a Phase 1/2 Study CIRM-0001 (NCT03088878) in combination with ibrutinib for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). 

Since the inception of Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc. in 2013, we have devoted most of our resources to organizing and staffing, business planning, raising capital, acquiring product candidates and securing related intellectual property rights and advancing ONCT-534, ONCT-808, zilovertamab and ONCT-216 clinical and preclinical development programs. Through September 30, 2024, we have funded our operations primarily through: (i) gross proceeds of 136.3 million from the issuance of common stock, (ii) gross proceeds of 49.0 million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, (iii) receipt of 14.5 million in subaward grant payments from UC San Diego, and (iv) cash proceeds of 18.3 million received in connection with the closing of the merger with GTx, Inc. in June 2019 (the "GTx Merger"). As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 14.6 million and no debt. 
 We have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or future product candidates. Our net loss was 25.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and we had an accumulated deficit of 223.2 million as of September 30, 2024. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with: (i) advancing our research and development programs, (ii) general and administrative costs associated with our operations, including the costs associated with operating as a public company, and (iii) in-process research and development costs associated with the GTx Merger. 
 On September 12, 2024, we announced that our Board decided to discontinue our clinical trials evaluating ONCT-534 and ONCT-808 as well as all other product development activities, and to begin exploring strategic alternatives to maximize the value of our assets for our stockholders, which may include asset sales, licensing or other transactions relating to our development program or a merger, reverse merger, acquisition, or other business combination opportunities. In connection with the exploration of strategic alternatives, we commenced a reduction-in-force beginning in September 2024, and will continue to assess further cost reduction measures as our operational and strategic direction evolves. As a result of this announcement, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease significantly as we discontinue our clinical research and development activities. We will continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with clinical trial closing costs and the completion of certain ongoing nonclinical research and manufacturing activities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have the following potential purchase obligations for which the timing and/or likelihood of occurrence is unknown; however, if such claims arise in the future, they could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Under our license agreements, we have payment obligations, which are contingent upon future events such as our achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and are required to make royalty payments in connection with the sales of products developed under those agreements. For additional details regarding these agreements, see the section titled Note 4 - Commitments, Contingencies and Related Party Transactions and Note 5 - License, Collaboration and Grant Award/Subaward Agreements to our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report; 

Obligations under contracts which are cancelable without significant penalty; 

Purchase orders issued in the ordinary course of business as they represent authorizations to purchase the items rather than binding agreements; and 

21 

Contracts in the normal course of business with clinical supply manufactures and with vendors for preclinical studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts are generally cancelable and provide for termination after a notice period. 

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our Board's decisions regarding strategic alternatives. 
 Management concluded that the balance of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments may not be sufficient to fund our planned expenditures and meet our obligations for at least the twelve months following the financial statement issuance date without entering into one or more collaborations or raising additional funding or making changes to operating plans or programs to reduce expenses. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months following the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments provide sufficient cash to fund our projected operating requirements into the first quarter of 2025. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Grant Revenue 
 Our grant revenue is derived from research and development grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 
 The NIH has awarded us three research and development grants for up to 4.1 million to support preclinical activities for our ONCT-534 and ONCT-216 programs, including 1.0 million payable to subawardees. Under the terms of the grant awards, we are entitled to receive reimbursement in arrears of incurring allowable expenditures. The earned NIH funds are non-refundable and we are required to provide periodic progress performance reports. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 2.1 million in award payments, recorded 1.9 million in grant revenue and had 0.3 million in an unbilled grant receivable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received 0.4 million in award payments, recorded 0.5 million in grant revenue and had 0.2 million in unbilled grant receivable. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of ONCT-534, ONCT-808, zilovertamab, and ONCT-216, which include: 
 expenses under agreements with consultants, third-party contract organizations, and investigative clinical trial sites that conduct research and development activities on our behalf; 

costs related to the development and manufacture of preclinical study and clinical trial material; 

salaries and employee-related costs, including non-cash stock-based compensation; 

costs incurred under our collaboration and third-party licensing agreements; and 

laboratory, regulatory and vendor expenses related to the execution of preclinical and clinical trials. 

We accrue all research and development costs in the period for which they are incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors, collaborators and third-party service providers. Advance payments for goods or services to be received in future periods for use in research and development activities are deferred and then expensed as the related goods are delivered and as services are performed. Any unearned advances would be refunded when known. 
 We expect our research and development expenses to significantly decrease as we discontinue our clinical research and development activities but will continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with clinical trial closing costs and the completion of certain ongoing manufacturing and nonclinical activities. 
 22 

Our direct research and development expenses are tracked by product candidate and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid under third-party license agreements and to outside consultants, contract research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturing organizations and research laboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. We do not allocate employee costs and costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies and facilities, including other indirect costs, to specific product candidates because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily to conduct our research as well as for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. These employees work across multiple programs and, therefore, we do not track our costs by product candidate unless we can include them as subaward costs. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, insurance costs, facility costs and professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. Personnel-related costs consist of salaries, benefits and non-cash stock-based compensation. We expect our general and administrative expenses will fluctuate based on our Board's decisions regarding strategic alternatives. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which primarily consist of money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities.

Research and development expenses for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 6.4 and 7.5 million, respectively. The decrease of 1.0 million was primarily due to a 0.8 million decrease in direct product candidate expenses and a 0.2 million decrease in unallocated expenses. 
 Direct expenses for ONCT-534 increased 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in manufacturing and clinical activities associated with the initiation of our Phase 1/2 clinical study of ONCT-534 in the third quarter of 2023. Such study was discontinued in the latter part of the third quarter of 2024. 
 Direct expenses for ONCT-808 decreased 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the discontinuance of our clinical trial in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Direct expenses for zilovertamab decreased 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower clinical trial activity and manufacturing costs associated with the reprioritization of this program in April 2023. Such study activities were completed in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Direct expenses for ONCT-216 increased 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 0.5 million sale of manufacturing materials to Shanghai Pharmaceutical (USA) Inc. (SPH USA) in 2023. Costs incurred in 2024 were substantially offset by NIH grant revenue. 
 Unallocated research and development expenses decreased 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses resulting from our headcount reductions as the year-to-date accrued bonuses were reversed in total and significantly offset by severance costs incurred. Excluding potential future severance costs while our strategic direction evolves, unallocated research and development expenses are expected to decrease in future periods as our research and development activities are being discontinued with a reduced headcount. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2.7 million and 3.1 million, respectively. The decrease of 0.4 million was primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses resulting from our headcount reductions as the year-to-date accrued bonuses were reversed in total and only partially offset by severance costs incurred, board compensation stopped being accrued or paid effective July 1, 2024, corporate insurance and legal expenses. Excluding potential future severance costs while our strategic direction evolves, general and administrative expenses are expected to decrease in future periods. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.2 million and 0.5 million, respectively. The decrease of 0.3 million was primarily due to lower average cash and investments balances. 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 19.1 million and 23.1 million, respectively. The decrease of 4.0 million was primarily due to a 2.5 million decrease in direct product candidate expenses and a 1.5 million decrease in unallocated research and development expenses. 
 Direct expenses for ONCT-534 increased 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in manufacturing and clinical activities associated with the initiation of our Phase 1/2 clinical study of ONCT-534 in the third quarter of 2023. Such study was discontinued in the latter part of the third quarter of 2024. 
 Direct expenses for ONCT-808 was 3.7 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Such study was discontinued in the latter part of the third quarter of 2024. 
 Direct expenses for zilovertamab decreased 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower clinical trial activity and manufacturing costs associated with the reprioritization of this program in April 2023. Such study activities terminated in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Direct expenses for ONCT-216 increased 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to 2023 expenses being offset by a 0.5 million sale of manufacturing materials to SPH USA. Costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were substantially offset by NIH revenue. 
 Unallocated research and development expenses decreased 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses, including non-cash stock-based compensation costs, resulting from our headcount reductions as the year-to-date accrued bonuses were reversed in total and only partially offset by severance costs incurred. Excluding potential future severance costs while our strategic direction evolves, unallocated research and development expenses are expected to decrease in future periods as our research and development activities are being discontinued with a reduced headcount. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 9.1 million and 9.5 million, respectively. The decrease of 0.4 million was primarily due to lower corporate insurance expenses which were partially offset by higher intellectual property related legal expenses. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.9 million and 1.8 million, respectively. The decrease of 0.9 million was primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances. 
 25 

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Operating Capital Requirements 
 We have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 223.2 million and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, we had 14.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and no debt. On September 12, 2024, we announced that our Board decided to discontinue our clinical trials evaluating ONCT-534 and ONCT-808 as well as all other product development activities. We also announced we were exploring strategic alternatives to maximize the value of our assets for our stockholders. We commenced a reduction-in-force beginning in September 2024, and will continue to assess further cost reduction measures as our operational and strategic direction evolves. As part of the review of strategic alternatives, we may consider options such as asset sales or out-licensing opportunities for existing programs and merger, reverse merger or other business combination opportunities. We will continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with clinical trial closing costs and the completion of certain ongoing and nonclinical research and manufacturing activities. 
 We believe the balance of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will not be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements and meet our obligations for at least the twelve months following the financial statement issuance date without entering into one or more collaborations or raising additional funding, liquidating assets, or making changes to our operating plans or programs to reduce expenses. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months following the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024. However, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments provide sufficient cash to fund our projected operating requirements into the first quarter of 2025. 
 In December 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement SM ("Sales Agreement"), with Jefferies LLC, providing for the sale of up 50.0 million of our common stock from time to time in at-the-market ("ATM") offerings under our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-254985) (the Prior Shelf Registration Statement ). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we sold none and 55,274 shares of common stock for net proceeds of none and 1.2 million, respectively, pursuant to our ATM program. On April 2, 2024, the ATM program expired. On March 8, 2024, we filed a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-277795) which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1, 2024.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 20.2 million and 25.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the reprioritization of the zilovertamab program in April 2023 as well as the timing of incurring expenses and payments, which were partially offset by increases in our spending on our two Phase 1/2 clinical studies. Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to our net loss of 25.4 million adjusted for 4.0 million of non-cash charges, primarily for stock-based compensation, which was partially offset by a 0.1 million change in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to our net loss of 30.3 million adjusted for 4.2 million of non-cash charges, primarily for stock-based compensation, and a 0.4 million change in operating assets and liabilities. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 26.7 million consisting primarily of net maturities of available-for-sale securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was 2.5 million consisting primarily of net maturities of available-for-sale securities. 
 26 

Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and net cash provided by financing activities was 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash used during 2024 resulted from common shares repurchased for tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of restricted stock units. The net cash provided during 2023 resulted primarily from the proceeds received from the sale of common stock under the ATM program. 
 On March 8, 2024, we filed a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-277795) which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1, 2024. Under current SEC regulations, if at any time our public float is less than 75.0 million, and for so long as our public float remains less than 75.0 million, the amount we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any twelve-month period using shelf registration statements is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float, which is referred to as the baby shelf rules. As of September 30, 2024, our calculated public float was less than 75.0 million. Future sales of our common stock, if any, will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the need for additional financing in connection with our review of strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in consummating future sales of our securities based on prevailing market conditions or in the quantities or at the prices that we deem appropriate. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 We are party to a number of license agreements, pursuant to which we have payment obligations that are contingent upon future events such as our achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and are required to make royalty payments in connection with the sale of products developed under those agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we were unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving the milestones or making future product sales. See Notes 4 and 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a description of these agreements. 
 We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical trial sites and clinical supply manufacturers and with vendors for preclinical studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination after a notice period and, therefore, are cancelable contracts. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. 
 Our estimates are based on our historical trends and other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Research and Development Expenses and Accruals 
 As part of the process of preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. Certain service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to: (i) CROs and other third parties in connection with clinical studies and preclinical development activities; (ii) investigative sites in connection with clinical studies; and (iii) third parties related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies. 
 We base our expenses related to CROs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with CROs that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our 
 27 

understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS 
 We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who serve as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Because of their inherent limitations, our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent material errors or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to risks, including that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 29 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedi ngs 
 From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors 
 An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the specific factors discussed below, as well as all other information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our financial statements, the notes thereto and the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, operating results, prospects and ability to accomplish our strategic objectives could be materially harmed. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our operations. The occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our securities. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than as follows: 
 Risks Related to Our Review of Strategic Alternatives 
 We may not be successful in identifying and implementing any potential strategic alternatives in a timely manner, or at all, and any strategic transactions that we may consummate in the future could have negative consequences. 
 In September 2024, we announced that we were discontinuing our clinical studies and exploring strategic alternatives. We expect to devote substantial time and resources to exploring strategic alternatives that our Board believes will maximize stockholder value. Despite management devoting significant efforts to identify and evaluate potential strategic alternatives, there can be no assurance that this strategic review process will result in us pursuing any transaction or that we will be able to successfully consummate any particular strategic transaction on attractive terms, on a timely basis, or at all. For example, certain types of strategic transactions may require third-party consents, such as stockholder approval, which could be difficult or costly to obtain. We have not set a timetable for completion of this strategic review process, and our Board has not approved a definitive course of action. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated or lead to increased stockholder value or that we will make any cash distributions to our stockholders. 
 The process of continuing to evaluate our strategic alternatives may be costly, time-consuming and complex, and we may incur significant legal, accounting and advisory fees and other expenses, some of which may be incurred regardless of whether we successfully enter into a transaction. We may also incur additional unanticipated expenses in connection with this process. Any such expenses will decrease the remaining cash available for use in our business. Our ability to pursue or consummate strategic transactions also depends upon our ability to retain certain of our employees, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the ability to identify, negotiate and consummate such transaction. If we are unable to successfully retain certain of our key remaining personnel, we are at risk of a disruption to our exploration and consummation of one or more strategic transactions. 
 In addition, potential counterparties in a strategic transaction involving us may place minimal or no value on our assets and our public listing. Further, should we resume the development of drug candidates, such as one or more of the programs in our pipeline for which we halted further development, the development and any potential commercialization of our drug candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund the costs associated with conducting the necessary preclinical and clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval. Consequently, any potential counterparty in a strategic transaction involving us may choose not to spend additional resources to resume or continue development of our future drug candidates and may attribute little or no value, in such a transaction, to our drug candidates. 
 In addition, any strategic transactions that we may pursue could have a variety of negative consequences, and we may enter into a transaction that yields unexpected results that adversely affect our business and decreases the remaining cash available for use in our business. Any potential transaction would be dependent on a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other things, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in a potential transaction with us, obtaining stockholder approval and the availability of financing to third parties in a potential transaction with us on reasonable terms. There can be no 
 30 

assurance that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated, lead to increased stockholder value, or achieve the anticipated results. 
 If we are unsuccessful in pursuing a new strategic path, or if any plans are not executed in a timely fashion, this may cause reputational harm with our stockholders and the value of our securities may be adversely impacted. In addition, speculation regarding any developments related to the review of strategic alternatives and perceived uncertainties related to the future of our company could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly. 
 We may become involved in litigation, including securities class action litigation, that could divert our management s attention and harm our business, and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages. 
 In the past in our industry, litigation, including securities class action litigation, has often followed certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a company or announcement of any other strategic transaction, or the announcement of negative events. These events may also result in investigations by the SEC. We may be exposed to such litigation even if no wrongdoing occurred. Litigation is usually expensive and diverts management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and cash resources and our ability to consummate a potential strategic transaction or the ultimate value our stockholders receive in any such transaction. 
 Our workforce reduction may not achieve our intended outcome and may result in significant adverse consequences. 
 In September 2024, in connection with our evaluation of strategic alternatives, our Board approved a reduction-in-force, which is intended to continue in stages as our operational and strategic direction evolves. This reduction-in-force may result in unintended consequences and costs, such as the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, attrition beyond the intended number of employees, decreased morale among our remaining employees, and the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the reduction-in-force. In addition, while positions have been eliminated, certain functions necessary to our operations remain, and we may be unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees among our remaining employees. The reduction-in-force could also make it difficult for us to pursue, or prevent us from pursuing, new opportunities and initiatives due to insufficient personnel, or require us to incur additional and unanticipated costs to hire new personnel to pursue such opportunities or initiatives, including any potential strategic alternatives. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from the reduction-in-force, or if we experience significant adverse consequences from the reduction-in-force, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
