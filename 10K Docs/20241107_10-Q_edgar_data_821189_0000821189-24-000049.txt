(1) The total intrinsic value of restricted stock and restricted stock units released during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was million and million, respectively. The intrinsic value is based upon the closing price of EOG's common stock on the date the restricted stock and restricted stock units are released.

 At September 30, 2024, unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock and restricted stock units totaled million. Such unrecognized expense will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of years. 
 
 Performance Units. EOG grants restricted stock units with performance-based conditions (Performance Units) annually to its executive officers without cost to them. For the grants made prior to September 2022, as more fully discussed in the grant agreements, the applicable performance metric is EOG's total shareholder return (TSR) over a performance period (Performance Period) relative to the TSR over the same period of a designated group of peer companies. Upon the application of the applicable performance multiple at the completion of the Performance Period, a minimum of and a maximum of of the Performance Units granted could be outstanding. 
 
 For the grants made beginning in September 2022, as more fully discussed in the grant agreements, the applicable performance metrics are 1) EOG's TSR over the Performance Period relative to the TSR over the same period of a designated group of peer companies and 2) EOG's average return on capital employed (ROCE) over the Performance Period. At the end of the Performance Period, a performance multiple based on EOG's relative TSR ranking will be determined, with a minimum performance multiple of and a maximum performance multiple of . A specified modifier ranging from - to + will then be applied to the performance multiple based on EOG's average ROCE over the Performance Period, provided that in no event shall the performance multiple, after applying the ROCE modifier, be less than or exceed . Furthermore, if EOG's TSR over the Performance Period is negative (i.e., less than ), the performance multiple will be capped at , regardless of EOG's relative TSR ranking or average ROCE over the Performance Period. 
 
 The fair value of the Performance Units is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. Stock-based compensation expense related to the Performance Unit grants totaled million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 At September 30, 2024, the million aggregate principal amount of EOG's Senior Notes due 2025 was classified as long-term debt based upon EOG's intent and ability to ultimately replace such amount with other long-term debt. 
 
 EOG currently has a billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (Agreement) with domestic and foreign lenders (Banks). The Agreement has a scheduled maturity date of June 7, 2028, and includes an option for EOG to extend, on up to occasions, the term for successive periods subject to certain terms and conditions. The Agreement (i) commits the Banks to provide advances up to an aggregate principal amount of billion at any one time outstanding, with an option for EOG to request increases in the aggregate commitments to an amount not to exceed billion, subject to certain terms and conditions, and (ii) includes a swingline subfacility and a letter of credit subfacility. Advances under the Agreement will accrue interest based, at EOG's option, on either the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus plus an applicable margin or the base rate (as defined in the Agreement) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin used in connection with interest rates and fees will be based on EOG's credit rating for its senior unsecured long-term debt at the applicable time. The Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants and events of default that EOG believes are customary for investment-grade, senior unsecured commercial bank credit agreements, including a financial covenant for the maintenance of a ratio of total debt-to-capitalization (as such terms are defined in the Agreement) of no greater than . At September 30, 2024, EOG was in compliance with this financial covenant. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the Agreement. The SOFR and base rate (inclusive of the applicable margins), had there been any amounts borrowed under the Agreement at September 30, 2024, would have been and , respectively. 
 
 Common Stock. In November 2021, the Board of Directors (Board) established a new share repurchase authorization that allows for the repurchase by EOG of up to billion of its common stock (Share Repurchase Authorization). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, EOG repurchased million shares of common stock for approximately million (inclusive of transaction fees and commissions) pursuant to the Share Repurchase Authorization. As of September 30, 2024, approximately billion remained available for repurchases under the Share Repurchase Authorization. Included in the Treasury Stock Repurchased amounts on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is million of estimated federal excise taxes. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Board increased the Share Repurchase Authorization from billion to billion, effective November 7, 2024. 
 
 Under the Share Repurchase Authorization, EOG may repurchase shares from time to time, at management's discretion, in accordance with applicable securities laws, including through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or any combination thereof. The timing and amount of repurchases is at the discretion of EOG's management and depends on a variety of factors, including the trading price of EOG's common stock, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market and economic conditions. Repurchased shares are held as treasury shares and are available for general corporate purposes. The Share Repurchase Authorization has no time limit, does not require EOG to repurchase a specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended, or terminated by the Board at any time.

 Financial Assets: Natural Gas Swaps Natural Gas Basis Swaps Financial Liabilities: Natural Gas Swaps 
 
 See Note 12 for the balance sheet amounts and classification of EOG's financial commodity and other derivative instruments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The estimated fair value of financial commodity and other derivative contracts was based upon forward commodity price curves based on quoted market prices. For the Brent Linked Gas Sales Contract, the estimated fair value was based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) significant Level 3 inputs, including future crude oil and natural gas prices. These Level 3 inputs are immaterial to the financial statements. Financial commodity and other derivative contracts were valued utilizing an independent third-party derivative valuation provider who uses various types of valuation models, as applicable. 
 
 Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements. The initial measurement of asset retirement obligations at fair value is calculated using discounted cash flow techniques and is based on internal estimates of future retirement costs associated with property, plant and equipment. Significant Level 3 inputs used in the calculation of asset retirement obligations include plugging costs and reserve lives. A reconciliation of EOG's asset retirement obligations is presented in Note 6. 
 
 When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the group. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) significant Level 3 inputs, including future crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value. 
 
 EOG utilized average prices per acre from comparable market transactions and estimated discounted cash flows as the basis for determining the fair value of unproved and proved properties, respectively, received in non-cash property exchanges. See Note 4.

million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which had estimated fair values at such dates of approximately million and million, respectively. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable (Level 2) inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at the end of each respective period. 
 
 Natural Gas Sales Linked to Brent Crude Oil. In February 2024, EOG entered into a agreement, commencing in 2027, to sell million British Thermal Units per day (MMBtud) of its domestic natural gas production, with MMBtud to be sold at a price indexed to Brent and the remaining volumes to be sold at a price indexed to Brent or a U.S. Gulf Coast gas index. It was determined that this agreement meets the definition of a derivative under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the ASC and does not qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception. As such, this agreement is accounted for as a derivative using the mark-to-market accounting method. Changes in the fair value are recognized as gains or losses in the period of change on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 EOG RESOURCES, INC. 

Overview 
 
 EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States of America (United States) with proved reserves in the United States and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (Trinidad). EOG is focused on being among the lowest-cost, highest-return and lowest-emissions producers, playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating costs and capital expenditures and maximizing reserve recoveries. Pursuant to this strategy, each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to maximize long-term shareholder value and maintain a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure, coupled with efficient and safe operations and robust environmental stewardship practices and performance, is integral in the implementation of EOG's strategy. 
 
 Commodity Prices . Prices for crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas have historically been volatile. This volatility is expected to continue due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political and economic environment and the global supply of, and demand for, crude oil, NGLs and natural gas and the availability of other energy supplies, the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers and other factors. 
 
 The market prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas impact the amount of cash generated from EOG's operating activities, which, in turn, impact EOG's financial position and results of operations. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, the average U.S. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) crude oil and natural gas prices were 77.55 per barrel and 2.10 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), respectively, representing an increase of 0.2 and a decrease of 22 , respectively, from the average NYMEX prices for the same period in 2023. Market prices for NGLs are influenced by the components extracted, including ethane, propane and butane and natural gasoline, among others, and the respective market pricing for each component. 
 
 Based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity as of September 30, 2024, for each 1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGL price, is approximately 153 million for net income and 196 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities, in each case for the full-year 2024. 
 
 Including the impact of EOG's natural gas financial derivative contracts and based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for which prices have not (as of September 30, 2024) been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity as of September 30, 2024, for each 0.10 per thousand cubic feet increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price, is approximately 27 million for net income and 34 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities, in each case for the full-year 2024. 
 
 Inflation Considerations. As further discussed in EOG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed on February 22, 2024 (EOG's 2023 Annual Report), EOG has, beginning in the second quarter of 2023, seen the inflationary pressures on its operating costs and capital expenditures (i.e., costs of fuel, steel, labor and drilling and completion services) diminish and, in certain circumstances, EOG has seen a decline in prices. 
 
 Despite such declining prices, EOG plans to continue its focus on increasing its drilling, completion and operating efficiencies and improving the performance of its wells. Such focus and the related initiatives EOG has undertaken, together with the flexibility provided by its multi-basin drilling portfolio, allowed EOG to largely offset the inflationary pressures it experienced beginning in the second half of 2021 and through the first three months of 2023. 
 
 -21- 

However, there can be no assurance that such efforts will offset, largely or at all, the impacts of any future inflationary pressures on EOG's operating costs and capital expenditures. Further, EOG expects the market for drilling and completion services and related labor and materials will continue to fluctuate and, as a result, there can be no assurance regarding the timing and impact of any future price changes on EOG's operating costs and capital expenditures and, in turn, on EOG's cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources, cash requirements or financial position or its ability to conduct its day-to-day drilling, completion and production operations. 
 
 Climate Change. For discussion of climate change matters and related regulatory matters, including potential developments related to climate change and the potential impacts and risks of such developments on EOG, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors and the related discussion in ITEM 1, Business - Regulation of EOG's 2023 Annual Report. EOG will continue to monitor and assess any climate change-related developments, including the SEC's climate-related disclosure rules adopted in March 2024, that could impact EOG and the oil and gas industry, to determine the impact on its business and operations, and take appropriate actions where necessary. 
 
 United States. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil plays and natural gas plays. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, EOG continued to (i) focus on improving well performance and operating efficiencies, (ii) evaluate certain potential crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas exploration and development prospects and (iii) look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins, exchanges or tactical or bolt-on acquisitions. On a volumetric basis, as calculated using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGLs production accounted for approximately 72 and 73 of EOG's United States production during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the first nine months of 2024, EOG's drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the Delaware Basin play and the Eagle Ford play. EOG's major producing areas in the United States are in New Mexico and Texas. 
 
 Trinidad. In Trinidad, EOG continues to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a), the Banyan Field and the Sercan Area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited, and crude oil and condensate which is sold to Heritage Petroleum Company Limited. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, EOG completed one net developmental well and one net exploratory well from the recently installed Osprey B platform in the Modified U(a) Block. EOG also completed one net exploratory well and is currently completing another exploratory well from the Oilbird platform in the SECC Block. In June 2024, EOG relinquished its rights to a portion of the contract area governed by the Trinidad Northern Area License located offshore the southwest coast of Trinidad. In July 2024, EOG signed a farmout agreement with BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC, which allows EOG to earn a 50 working interest to develop the Coconut gas field in the East Mayaro and South East Galeota Areas. Additionally, EOG is currently in discussions with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago regarding the potential award of the Lower Reverse L and NCMA 4(a) Blocks in respect of the 2023 shallow water bid round. In the fourth quarter of 2024, EOG expects to recomplete two wells in the Sercan Area and also drill an exploratory well in the deep Teak, Samaan and Poui Area. Additionally, EOG expects to complete construction and installation of the platform and commence pipeline installation in the Mento Area. 
 
 Other International. In November 2021, a subsidiary of EOG was granted an exploration permit for the WA-488-P Block, located offshore Western Australia. During the first nine months of 2024, EOG continued to prepare for the drilling of an exploration well in this block. 
 
 EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States, primarily by pursuing exploration opportunities in countries where crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified. 

-22- 

2024 Capital and Operating Plan . Total 2024 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately 6.1 billion to 6.3 billion, including exploration and development drilling, facilities, leasehold acquisitions, capitalized interest, dry hole costs and other property, plant and equipment and excluding property acquisitions, asset retirement costs, non-cash exchanges and transactions and exploration costs incurred as operating expenses. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States drilling activity in its plays where it generates the highest rates of return - specifically, in the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Utica and Rocky Mountain area. To further enhance the economics of these plays, EOG expects to continue to improve well performance and to focus on improving operating efficiencies; see the above related discussion. Full-year 2024 total crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production is expected to increase modestly versus 2023. In addition, EOG plans to continue to spend a portion of its anticipated 2024 capital expenditures on leasing acreage, evaluating new prospects, transportation infrastructure and environmental projects. 
 
 Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. 
 
 Capital Structure . One of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 11 at September 30, 2024 and 12 at December 31, 2023. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, EOG maintained a strong financial and liquidity position, including 6.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand and 1.9 billion of availability under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2024, the 500 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.15 Senior Notes due 2025 was classified as long-term debt based upon EOG's intent and ability to ultimately replace such amount with other long-term debt. 
 
 The Internal Revenue Service previously announced tax relief related to 2024 severe weather events occurring in various Texas counties, including Harris County where EOG's corporate offices are located. The tax relief permits eligible taxpayers to postpone certain tax filings and payments. 
 
 EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank borrowings, borrowings under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility, joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings. For related discussion, see ITEM 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity included in EOG's 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Cash Return Framework. In November 2023, EOG announced an increase in its cash return commitment - specifically, a commitment, effective beginning with fiscal year 2024, to return a minimum of 70 of annual net cash provided by operating activities before certain balance sheet-related changes, less total capital expenditures, to stockholders, through a combination of quarterly dividends, special dividends and share repurchases. 
 
 For discussion regarding EOG's payment of dividends and share repurchases, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors and ITEM 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in EOG's 2023 Annual Report and Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Dividend Declarations. On February 22, 2024, the Board of Directors (Board) declared a quarterly cash dividend on the common stock of 0.91 per share paid on April 30, 2024, to stockholders of record as of April 16, 2024. 
 
 On May 2, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend on the common stock of 0.91 per share paid on July 31, 2024, to stockholders of record as of July 17, 2024. 
 
 On August 1, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend on the common stock of 0.91 per share paid on October 31, 2024, to stockholders of record as of October 17, 2024. 
 
 -23- 

On November 7, 2024, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the previous 0.91 per share to 0.975 per share, effective beginning with the dividend payable on January 31, 2025, to stockholders of record as of January 17, 2025. 
 
 Share Repurchases. In November 2021, the Board established a new share repurchase authorization that allows for the repurchase by EOG of up to 5 billion of its common stock (Share Repurchase Authorization). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, EOG repurchased 6.1 million and 18.0 million shares of common stock for approximately 758 million and 2,198 million (inclusive of transaction fees and commissions), respectively, pursuant to the Share Repurchase Authorization. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 1.8 billion remained available for repurchases under the Share Repurchase Authorization. Included in the Treasury Stock Repurchased amounts on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are 7 million and 20 million, respectively, of estimated federal excise taxes. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Board increased the Share Repurchase Authorization from 5 billion to 10 billion, effective November 7, 2024. 
 
 Under the Share Repurchase Authorization, EOG may repurchase shares from time to time, at management's discretion, in accordance with applicable securities laws, including through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or any combination thereof. The timing and amount of repurchases is at the discretion of EOG's management and depends on a variety of factors, including the trading price of EOG's common stock, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market and economic conditions. Repurchased shares are held as treasury shares and are available for general corporate purposes. The Share Repurchase Authorization has no time limit, does not require EOG to repurchase a specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended, or terminated by the Board at any time.

Results of Operations 
 
 The following review of operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of EOG and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Operating Revenues. During the third quarter of 2024, operating revenues decreased 247 million, or 4 , to 5,965 million from 6,212 million for the same period of 2023. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 251 million, or 5 , to 4,384 million from 4,635 million for the same period of 2023. EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity and other derivative contracts of 79 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to net gains of 43 million for the same period of 2023. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues for the third quarter of 2024 increased 3 million to 1,481 million from 1,478 million for the same period of 2023. Net losses on asset dispositions were 7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to net gains of 35 million for the same period of 2023.

 (3) Thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil e q uivalent, as applicable; includes crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand. 

-26- 

Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 229 million, or 6 , to 3,488 million from 3,717 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease was due to a lower composite average price 317 million), partially offset by an increase of 9.7 MBbld, or 2 , in wellhead crude oil and condensate production 88 million). Increased production was primarily from the Utica. EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 8 to 76.92 per barrel compared to 83.60 per barrel for the same period of 2023. 
 
 NGL revenues for the third quarter of 2024 increased 23 million, or 5 , to 524 million from 501 million for the same period of 2023 due to an increase of 23.2 MBbld, or 10 , in NGL deliveries 51 million), partially offset by a lower composite average price 28 million). Increased production was primarily from the Permian Basin. EOG's composite NGL price for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 5 to 22.42 per barrel compared to 23.56 per barrel for the same period of 2023. 
 
 Wellhead natural gas revenues for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 45 million, or 11 , to 372 million from 417 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease was due to a lower composite average price 114 million), partially offset by an increase in natural gas deliveries 69 million). Natural gas deliveries for the third quarter of 2024 increased 266 MMcfd, or 16 , compared to the same period of 2023 due primarily to increased production of associated natural gas from the Permian Basin and higher natural gas deliveries in Trinidad. EOG's composite wellhead natural gas price for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 23 to 2.05 per Mcf compared to 2.66 per Mcf for the same period of 2023. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity and other derivative contracts of 79 million compared to net gains of 43 million for the same period of 2023. The net gains of 79 million included gains of 15 million related to the Brent crude oil (Brent) linked gas sales contract. During the third quarter of 2024, net cash received from settlements of financial commodity derivative contracts was 61 million compared to net cash received from settlements of financial commodity derivative contracts of 23 million for the same period of 2023. 
 
 Gathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, as well as fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of EOG-owned sand. Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas may be utilized in order to balance firm capacity at third-party facilities with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. EOG sells sand primarily in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations. Marketing costs represent the costs to purchase third-party crude oil, natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs, as well as costs associated with EOG-owned sand sold to third parties. 
 
 Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 114 million as compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to lower margins on crude oil marketing activities. 
 
 Operating and Other Expenses. For the third quarter of 2024, operating expenses of 3,876 million were 221 million higher than the 3,655 million incurred during the third quarter of 2023. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Lease and Well 3.96 4.02 Gathering, Processing and Transportation Costs (GP T) 4.50 4.42 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD A) - Oil and Gas Properties 9.89 9.31 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.53 0.47 General and Administrative (G A) 1.69 1.75 Interest Expense, Net 0.31 0.39 Total (1)

 (1) Total excludes exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. 
 
 -27- 

The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, GP T, DD A, G A and interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, are set forth below. See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of wellhead volumes. 
 
 Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, produced water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. 
 
 Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. 
 
 Lease and well expenses of 392 million for the third quarter of 2024 increased 23 million from 369 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased operating and maintenance costs 18 million) and increased lease and well administrative expenses 6 million), both in the United States. Lease and well expenses increased in the United States primarily due to increased operating activities resulting from increased production. 
 
 GP T costs represent costs to process and deliver hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. GP T costs include operating and maintenance expenses from EOG-owned assets, fees paid to third party operators and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's GP T assets. EOG pays third parties to process the majority of its natural gas production to extract NGLs. 
 
 GP T costs of 445 million for the third quarter of 2024 increased 39 million from 406 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased GP T costs related to increased production in the Permian Basin and Utica. 
 
 DD A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD A group calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD A rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period. DD A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. 
 
 DD A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased 133 million to 1,031 million from 898 million for the same prior year period. DD A expenses associated with oil and gas properties for the third quarter of 2024 were 123 million higher than the same prior year period. The increase primarily reflects increased production in the United States 54 million) and in Trinidad 8 million), and increased unit rates in the United States 50 million) and in Trinidad 11 million). DD A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment for the third quarter of 2024 were 10 million higher than the same prior year period primarily due to an increase in expenses related to GP T assets and equipment. 
 
 G A expenses of 167 million for the third quarter of 2024 increased 6 million from 161 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased professional and other services costs. 
 
 Interest expense, net of 31 million for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 5 million compared to the same prior year period primarily due to higher capitalized interest. 
 
 Impairments include: amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment.

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 
 Cash Flow. The primary sources of cash for EOG during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were funds generated from operations and, to a lesser extent, net cash received from settlements of financial commodity derivative contracts. The primary uses of cash were exploration and development expenditures; funds used in operations; dividend payments to stockholders; purchases of treasury stock; and other property, plant and equipment expenditures. During the first nine months of 2024, EOG's cash balance increased 844 million to 6,122 million from 5,278 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 9,380 million for the first nine months of 2024 increased 1,144 million compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to an increase in wellhead revenues 450 million), a decrease in net cash used in working capital and other assets and liabilities 450 million), an increase in net cash received from settlements of financial commodity derivative contracts 325 million), and a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes 289 million), partially offset by the return of cash collateral posted for financial commodity derivative contracts in the first nine months of 2023 324 million) and an increase in cash operating expenses 153 million). 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 4,691 million for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 150 million compared to the same period of 2023 due to a decrease in cash used in working capital associated with investing activities 610 million), partially offset by an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment 264 million), a decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets 116 million) and an increase in additions to oil and gas properties 80 million).

Total Expenditures. For the full-year 2024, EOG's updated budget for exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures is estimated to range from approximately 6.1 billion to 6.3 billion, including exploration and development drilling, facilities, leasehold acquisitions, capitalized interest, dry hole costs and other property, plant and equipment and excluding property acquisitions, asset retirement costs, non-cash exchanges and transactions and exploration costs incurred as operating expenses. The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Expenditure Category Capital Exploration and Development Drilling (1) 
 3,512 3,619 Facilities 430 373 Leasehold Acquisitions (2)

 (28) 227 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures 4,305 4,546 Other Property, Plant and Equipment (5) 
 902 638 Total Expenditures 5,207 5,184 
 
 (1) Exploration and development drilling included 85 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, related to non-cash development drilling. 
 (2) Leasehold acquisitions included 82 million and 60 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to non-cash property exchanges. 
 (3) Property acquisitions included 24 million and 9 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to non-cash property exchanges. 
 (4) Asset Retirement Costs for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 included a downward revision to asset retirement obligations of 84 million . 
 (5) Other Property, Plant and Equipment included 137 million related to the acquisition of a gathering system in South Texas and 134 million related to the acquisition of a gathering and processing system in the Powder River Basin for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Exploration and development expenditures of 4,333 million for the first nine months of 2024 were 14 million higher than the same period of 2023 primarily due to increased facilities expenditures 57 million) and increased leasehold acquisitions 52 million), partially offset by decreased development drilling expenditures 92 million). Exploration and development expenditures for the first nine months of 2024 of 4,333 million consisted of 3,797 million in development drilling and facilities, 478 million in exploration, 32 million in capitalized interest and 26 million in property acquisitions. Exploration and development expenditures for the first nine months of 2023 of 4,319 million consisted of 3,836 million in development drilling and facilities, 450 million in exploration, 24 million in capitalized interest and 9 million in property acquisitions. 
 
 The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other economic factors. EOG believes it has significant flexibility and availability with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG.

Financial Commodity and Other Derivative Transactions. As more fully discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in EOG's 2023 Annual Report, EOG engages in price risk management activities from time to time. These activities are intended to manage EOG's exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. EOG utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments, primarily price swap, option, swaption, collar and basis swap contracts, as a means to manage this price risk. EOG has not designated any of its financial commodity and other derivative contracts as accounting hedges and, accordingly, accounts for financial commodity and other derivative contracts using the mark-to-market accounting method, including the Brent linked gas sales contract. Under this accounting method, changes in the fair value of outstanding financial and other derivative instruments are recognized as gains or losses in the period of change and are recorded as Gains on Mark-to-Market Financial Commodity and Other Derivative Contracts on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The related cash flow impact is reflected in Cash Flows from Operating Activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 
 The total fair value of EOG's financial commodity and other derivative contracts was reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024, as a net asset of 77 million. 
 
 As discussed in "Operating Revenues," the net cash received from settlements of financial commodity derivative contracts during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 61 million and 195 million, respectively. 
 
 Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts settled during the period from January 1, 2024 to October 31, 2024 (closed) and outstanding as of October 31, 2024. Natural gas volumes are presented in MMBtu per day (MMBtud) and prices are presented in dollars per MMBtu /MMBtu).

Natural Gas Sales Linked to Brent Crude Oil. In February 2024, EOG entered into a 10-year agreement, commencing in 2027, to sell 180,000 MMBtud of its domestic natural gas production, with 140,000 MMBtud to be sold at a price indexed to Brent and the remaining volumes to be sold at a price indexed to Brent or a U.S. Gulf Coast gas index. It was determined that this agreement meets the definition of a derivative under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification and does not qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception. As such, this agreement is accounted for as a derivative using the mark-to-market accounting method. Changes in the fair value are recognized as gains or losses in the period of change on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 See Part I, Item 1, Note 8 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Item 103 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, Exchange Act) requires disclosure regarding certain proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental laws when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that EOG reasonably believes will exceed a specified threshold. Pursuant to such item, EOG will be using a threshold of 1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. EOG believes proceedings under this threshold are not material to EOG's business and financial condition (the choice of this threshold does not imply that matters with potential monetary sanctions in excess of 1 million are necessarily material to EOG's business or financial condition). Applying this threshold, there are no environmental proceedings to disclose for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

 (3) Under the Share Repurchase Authorization, EOG may repurchase shares from time to time, at management's discretion, in accordance with applicable securities laws, including through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or any combination thereof. The timing and amount of repurchases is at the discretion of EOG's management and depends on a variety of factors, including the trading price of EOG's common stock, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market and economic conditions. Repurchased shares are held as treasury shares and are available for general corporate purposes. The Share Repurchase Authorization has no time limit, does not require EOG to repurchase a specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended or terminated by the Board at any time.
