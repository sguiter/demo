 There are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of total revenue is concentrated in a limited number of customers. Should a significant customer terminate or fail to renew its contracts with us, in whole or in part, for any reason, or experience significant financial or operating difficulties, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In general, a customer that makes up a significant portion of revenues in one period, may not make up a significant portion in subsequent periods.

 Parent Company Guarantees 
 Prior to July 2023, the Company agreed in certain customer contracts to provide a guarantee that the value of purchased hardware will not decline for a certain period of time. Under this guarantee, if these customers were unable to install or designate the hardware to a specified project within such period of time, the Company would be required to assist the customer in re-marketing the hardware for resale by the customer. If a resale does not occur, the hardware will be appraised utilizing a third party. The guarantee provided that, in such cases, if the customer resold the hardware for less than the amount initially sold to the customer or the appraisal value is less than the hardware purchase price, the Company would be required to compensate the customer for any shortfall in fair value for the hardware from the initial contract price. The Company accounts for such contractual terms and guarantees as variable consideration at each measurement date. The Company updates its estimate of variable consideration each quarter, including changes in estimates related to such guarantees, for facts or circumstances that have changed from the time of the initial estimate. As a result, the Company recorded a net revenue reductions of million and million in hardware revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The overall reduction in revenue was related to deliveries that occurred prior to the current fiscal year. 
 Impairment and Accounts Receivable Write-Off 
 For those contracts where the customers invoked parent company guarantee PCG protection pursuant to the applicable contract, the Company has worked actively to remarket the remaining systems subject to PCG with a wide variety of potential customers. The Company has been engaged in ongoing negotiations with several parties, including the original customers who hold title to the assets, for the purchase of the remarketed hardware. Despite such efforts, such negotiations have resulted in limited transactions with mutually agreed upon pricing and terms. Recent closed transactions have resulted in resales at prices significantly below carrying values. Under contracts containing a PCG provision, in the event that the Company and the customer are unable to remarket and sell the relevant assets, the customer shall engage a third party to appraise the fair market value of the remaining hardware. As of the date of this report, none of such customers have elected to obtain a third party hardware appraisal for the previously purchased hardware. Given the uncertainty of collection from the original customers of due and unpaid amounts in those cases where the Company believes it has enforceable rights of recovery, the Company believes the likelihood for collection of the accounts receivable outstanding relating to hardware subject to these PCG s is no longer probable. Accordingly, the Company wrote-off the remaining receivables of million during the three months

Factors herein to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. 
 
 Overview 
 Our mission is to help our customers plan, deploy, and operate clean energy assets via AI-enabled software and services. 
 In order to fulfill our mission, we provide our customers, which include energy traders, asset owners, independent power producers, community choice aggregators, offtakers, renewable project developers, EPCs, operations maintenance providers, electric cooperatives, utilities, load-serving entities, and grid operators, with (i) an integrated suite of software and edge products, and (ii) full-lifecycle energy services from a team of leading experts. 
 We have historically operated in two key areas within the energy landscape: Behind-the-Meter BTM and Front-of-the-Meter FTM ). An energy system s position in relation to a customer s electric meter determines whether it is designated a BTM or FTM system. BTM systems provide power that can be used on-site without interacting with the electric grid and passing through an electric meter. FTM, grid-connected systems provide power to off-site locations and must pass through an electric meter prior to reaching an end-user. 
 For BTM customers, we help mitigate customer energy costs through services such as time-of-use and demand charge management optimization and by aggregating the dispatch of energy through a network of virtual power plants. Our software and services are designed to enable our customers to reduce C I energy bills, increase energy yield, and facilitate the achievement of corporate environmental, social, and corporate governance ESG and carbon reduction objectives. 
 For FTM customers, our software and services help decrease risk by adapting to dynamic energy market conditions in connection with the deployment of electricity and improving the value of energy assets over the course of their FTM system s lifetime. 
 Since our inception in 2009, we have engaged in developing and marketing AI-enabled software and services, raising capital, and recruiting personnel. As the energy landscape has changed in recent years, we have increasingly focused on larger, utility-scale projects, supporting energy asset owners, developers, operators, and traders. Over the last 15 years, we have grown into one of the most experienced energy storage providers in the world, achieving milestones such as deploying systems with Fortune 500 brands, operating the largest virtual power plant in California, and bringing energy storage into several emerging energy markets across the United States. 
 We have incurred net operating losses and negative cash flows from operations each year since our inception. We have financed our operations primarily through cash flows from customers, proceeds from the Merger, convertible senior notes, and issuance of convertible preferred stock. 
 Our total revenue decreased from 133.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 29.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We incurred net losses of 148.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and incurred net losses of 77.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our total revenue decrease d from 294.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 88.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred net losses of 802.9 million and 102.7 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 1,575.4 million. 
 We expect to continue to exercise discipline and moderate expenses associated with sales and marketing, research and development, regulatory and related functions. In addition, we expect to continue to manage and reduce our general and administrative expenses associated with scaling our business operations and being a public company, including compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, legal, audit, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities, and other administrative and professional services. 
 
 Key Factors, Trends and Uncertainties Affecting our Business 
 We believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors, some of which present significant opportunities for us, and some of which pose risks and challenges, including but not limited to: 
 
 Execution of our New Strategy 
 We recently announced a new business strategy that reflects a renewed focus on developing and marketing our AI-enabled software and services offerings. This transition will entail significant operational changes, including reduction of what has historically been the source of most of our revenue (battery resales), adjustments to the way we develop and market our products and services, and realignment of our business processes. These changes are expected to reduced revenue, increased costs and short-term disruptions in our operations, which may negatively affect our ability to effectively scale the software and services segments of our business and achieve our financial and operational targets. Failure to successfully and timely implement our new strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 26 

See We may not be able to successfully implement our recently announced new strategy. in Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Report for additional information about certain risks related to our new strategy. 
 In addition, the execution of our new business strategy is expected to require significant investment in our human capital and infrastructure. As of September 30, 2024 , we had cash and cash equivalents of 75.4 million (as compared to 89.6 million as of June 30, 2024 and 105.4 million as of December 31, 2023 ), while our operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 150.6 million . Our cash reserves may constrain our ability to make the investments required to execute our new strategy or may otherwise not be sufficient to fund operations. If our cash flow from operations does not improve as quickly as expected, or if we are unable to secure additional sources of capital if or when the need arises, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 Customer Concentration 
 We depend on a small number of significant customers for our sales, and a small number of customers have historically accounted for a material portion of our revenue. While we are committed to diversifying our customer base, we may continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers. Loss of a significant customer, the inability to close (or a delay in closing) a significant contract at any time, or a significant reduction in pricing or order volume from a significant customer, have (in the case of contractual delays), resulted in material reductions in revenue and other adverse effects in certain quarters, and may do so in the future. 
 
 NYSE Notice 
 On August 28, 2024, we received formal notice from the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE that we were not in compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of our shares of common stock had fallen below 1.00 per share over a period of 30 consecutive trading days. We subsequently notified the NYSE of our intent to regain compliance with the requirements of Section 802.01C. We are able to regain compliance at any time within the six-month period following receipt of the notice if, on the last trading day of any calendar month during this cure period (or the last trading day of this cure period), we have a closing share price of at least 1.00 and an average closing share price of at least 1.00 over the prior 30 trading-day period. If we do not regain compliance with Section 802.01C within such cure period, the NYSE may commence delisting proceedings. 
 The notice does not affect our ongoing business operations or our SEC reporting requirements. 
 For more information, see Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors We may fail to qualify for continued listing on the NYSE, which could make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares. 
 
 Parent Company Guarantees 
 Prior to July 2023, we agreed in certain customer contracts, to provide a guarantee that the value of purchased hardware will not decline for a certain period of time, as more fully described above under Note 3 Revenue , of the Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Report. We account for such contractual terms and guarantees as variable consideration at each measurement date. We update our estimates of variable consideration each quarter, including changes in estimates related to such guarantees, for facts or circumstances that have changed from the time of the initial estimate. As a result, the Company recorded a net revenue reduction of 38.7 million in hardware revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The overall reduction in revenue was related to deliveries that occurred prior to the current fiscal year. 
 Because we have not included these parent company guarantees in our contracts since July 2023, and because we do not intend to provide guarantees in customer contracts going forward, we believe that excluding the effect of the 38.7 million net reduction in revenue from adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP gross profit enhances the comparability to these metrics in prior periods. 
 Depending on various market conditions in the future that we cannot currently predict, we may experience future revenue reductions as a result of outstanding guarantees, one or more of which may be material. 
 Impairment and Accounts Receivable Write-Off 
 For those contracts where the customers invoked parent company guarantee PCG protection pursuant to the applicable contract, we have worked actively to remarket the remaining systems subject to PCG with a wide variety of potential customers , as more fully described above under Note 3 Revenue , of the Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Report. Given the uncertainty of collection from the original customers of due and unpaid amounts in those cases where we believe we have enforceable rights of recovery, we believe the likelihood for collection of the accounts receivable outstanding relating to hardware subject to these PCG s is no longer probable. Accordingly, we wrote-off the remaining receivables of 104.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We are evaluating all potential remedies with respect to its enforceable rights under applicable contracts. 
 27 

Seasonality 
 Our results of operations have typically fluctuated due to seasonal trends, which we expect to recur in future periods. Historically, we have recognized most of our revenue in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to various factors, including the requirement by our customers to reach target commercial operation dates for their renewable energy projects as well as tax equity and financing considerations. For instance, our revenue recognized in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 accounted for 65 of the total revenue recognized in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The seasonality of our results of operations may be mitigated as our software and services offerings begin to comprise a greater percentage of our total revenue. 
 
 Supply Chain Constraints and Risk 
 We rely on a very small number of suppliers of energy storage systems and other equipment. If any of our suppliers were unable or unwilling to provide us with contracted quantities in a timely manner at prices, quality levels, and volumes acceptable to us, we would have very limited alternatives for supply, and we may not be able find suitable replacements for our customers, if at all. Such an event could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 DevCo Joint Ventures 
 We, through an indirect wholly-owned development subsidiary, have entered into strategic joint ventures with qualified third parties to develop select energy storage generation projects DevCo Projects ), as more fully described above under Note 1 Business , of the Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this report. These projects sometimes require significant upfront investment by us and can involve a high degree of risk. If a DevCo Project fails to reach completion or is significantly delayed, we could lose all or a portion of our development capital investment. See We Face Risks Related to our DevCo Business Model in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information about certain risks related to these DevCo Projects. 
 
 Decline in Lithium-Ion Battery Costs 
 Our revenue growth is directly tied to the continued adoption of energy storage systems by our customers. The cost of lithium-ion energy storage hardware has generally declined over the last decade, but increased demand and global supply chain constraints could cause price increases in the future. The market for energy storage is rapidly evolving, and while we believe costs will continue to decline over time, there is no guarantee. If costs do not continue to decline, or do not decline as quickly as we anticipate, this could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business. The United States Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA was signed into law in August 2022 and includes incentives and tax credits aimed at reducing the effects of climate change, such as a tax credit for stand-alone battery storage projects. The implementation of the IRA is expected to further reduce the cost of battery storage systems for certain customers; however, there are numerous restrictions and requirements associated with qualifying for the tax credits and other incentives available under the IRA, and we continue to assess Treasury Department and other guidance on how the IRA impacts our business. 
 Increase in Deployment of Renewables 
 Deployment of intermittent resources has accelerated over the last decade, and today, wind and solar have become a low cost energy source. We expect the cost of generating renewable energy to continue to decline and deployments of energy storage systems to increase. As renewable energy sources of energy production are expected to represent a larger proportion of energy generation, grid instability rises due to their intermittency, which can be addressed by energy storage solutions. The IRA is expected to further increase the deployment of renewable energy assets. We are continuing to evaluate the IRA and its requirements, including Treasury Department guidance, and its application to our business and our customers. 
 Competition 
 We are a market leader in terms of capacity of energy storage under management. We intend to strengthen our competitive position over time by leveraging the network effect of Athena s AI infrastructure. Existing competitors may expand their product offerings and sales strategies, and new competitors may enter the market. Furthermore, our competitors include other types of software providers and some hardware manufacturers that offer software solutions. If our market share declines due to increased competition, our revenue and ability to generate profits in the future may be adversely affected. 
 Government Regulation and Compliance 
 Although we are not regulated as a utility, the market for our products and services is heavily influenced by federal, state, and local government statutes and regulations concerning electricity. These statutes and regulations, like the IRA, affect electricity pricing, net metering, incentives, taxation, competition with utilities, and the interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. In the United States and internationally, governments regularly modify these statutes and regulations and acting through state utility or public service commissions, regularly change and adopt different rates for commercial customers. These changes can positively or negatively affect our ability to deliver cost savings to customers. 
 28 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to financial results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP , we use adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP gross profit and margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures, for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate our operating performance and prospects, develop internal budgets and financial goals, and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our operating performance, such as stock-based compensation and other non-cash charges, as well as discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they both (1) allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP gross profit and margin should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Margin 
 We define non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding amortization of capitalized software, impairments related to decommissioning of end-of-life systems, excess supplier costs, reduction in revenue, and revenue constraints. We define non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue. 
 We generally record the full purchase order value as revenue at the time of hardware delivery; however, for certain non-cancelable purchase orders entered into during the first quarter of 2023, the final settlement amount payable to us is variable and indexed to the price per ton of lithium carbonate in the first quarter of 2024 such that we may increase or decrease the final prices in such purchase orders based on the price per ton of lithium carbonate at final settlement. Lithium carbonate is a key raw material used in the production of hardware systems that we ultimately sell to our customers. The total dollar amount of such purchase orders for the indexed contracts was approximately 52.0 million. However, due to the pricing structure in such purchase orders, we recorded revenue in the first quarter of 2023 of approximately 42.0 million, net of a 10.2 million revenue constraint, using a third party forecast of the lithium carbonate trading value in the first quarter of 2024. Because we had not previously used indexed pricing in our customer contracts or purchase orders and had not previously constrained revenue related to forecasted inputs of our hardware systems, we believe that including the 10.2 million revenue constraint from the first quarter of 2023 into non-GAAP gross profit enhances the comparability to our non-GAAP gross profit in prior periods. We are expected to receive, pursuant to such purchase orders, final consideration of at least approximately 34.0 million. We recorded the full cost of hardware revenue for these indexed contracts in the first quarter of 2023. 
 In the first quarter of 2024, we incurred costs of 1.0 million above initially agreed prices on the acquisition of certain hardware systems from one of our suppliers, which resulted from production delays by such supplier. Because we had not previously incurred costs above initially agreed prices with a hardware supplier, we excluded this item from adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP gross profit to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.

Adjusted EBITDA 
 As discussed above, we believe that adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors to use in comparing our financial performance with the performance of other companies. Nonetheless, the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude when calculating adjusted EBITDA. 
 We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to us before depreciation and amortization, including amortization of internally developed software, interest expense, further adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and other income and expense items, including revenue constraint, reduction in revenue, excess supplier costs, change in fair value of derivative liability, impairment of goodwill, contract termination payment, restructuring costs and income tax provision or benefit.

 (3) Total GW of systems in operation or under contract. 
 (4) Contracted Annual Recurring Revenue CARR ): Annual run rate for all executed software services contracts including contracts signed in the period for systems that are not yet commissioned or operating. 
 
 Bookings 
 Due to the long-term nature of our contracts, bookings are a key metric that allows us to understand and evaluate the growth of our Company and our estimated future revenue related to customer contracts for our energy optimization services and transfer of energy storage systems. Bookings represent the accumulated value at a point in time of contracts that have been executed under both our host customer and partnership sales models. 
 
 For host customer sales, bookings represent the expected consideration from energy optimization services contracts, including estimated incentive payments that are earned by the host customer from utility companies in relation to the services provided by us and assigned by the host customer to us. For host customer sales, there are no differences between bookings and remaining performance obligations at any point in time. 
 For partnership sales, bookings are the sum of the expected consideration to be received from the transfer of hardware and energy optimization services (excluding any potential revenues from market participation). For partnership sales, even though we have secured an executed contract with estimated timing of project delivery and installation from the customer, we do not consider it a contract in accordance with FASB ASU 2014-09 Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ), or a remaining performance obligation, until the customer has placed a binding purchase order. A signed customer contract is considered a booking as this indicates the customer has agreed to place a purchase order in the foreseeable future, which typically occurs within three (3) months of contract execution. However, executed customer contracts, without binding purchase orders, are cancellable without penalty by either party. 
 For partnership sales, once a purchase order has been executed, the booking is considered to be a contract in accordance with ASC 606, and therefore, gives rise to a remaining performance obligation as we have an obligation to transfer hardware and energy optimization services in our partnership agreements. We also have the contractual right to receive consideration for our performance obligations. 
 32 

The accounting policy and timing of revenue recognition for host customer contracts and partnership arrangements that qualify as contracts with customers under ASC 606, are described within Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate services and other revenue and hardware revenue. Services and other revenue is generated through (i) energy optimization software and (ii) asset management software (iii) the sale of project assets and advisory services. . Software fees charged to customers generally consist of recurring fixed monthly payments throughout the term of the contract and in some arrangements, an installation and/or upfront fee component. We may also receive incentives from utility companies in relation to the sale of our services. 
 We generate hardware revenue through (i) sales of OEM energy storage systems and (ii) edge hardware devices. Performance obligations are satisfied when the energy storage system and edge hardware device along with all ancillary hardware components are delivered. The milestone payments received before the delivery of hardware are treated as deferred revenue. In certain customer contracts, we agreed to provide a guarantee that the value of purchased hardware will not decline for a certain period of time, as more fully described below under Note 3 Revenue , of the Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Report. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of services and other revenue includes depreciation of the cost of energy storage systems we own under long-term customer contracts, which includes capitalized fulfillment costs, such as installation services, permitting and other related costs. Cost of services and other revenue also includes the costs for the development and constructions of project assets. Cost of revenue may also include any impairment of inventory and energy storage systems, along with system maintenance costs associated with the ongoing services provided to customers. Costs of revenue are recognized as energy optimization and other supporting services are provided to our customers throughout the term of the contract. 
 Cost of hardware revenue generally includes the cost of the hardware purchased from a manufacturer, shipping, delivery, and other costs required to fulfill our obligation to deliver the energy storage system to the customer location. Cost of hardware revenue may also include any impairment of energy storage systems held in our inventory for sale to our customer. Cost of hardware revenue related to the sale of energy storage systems is recognized when the delivery of the product is completed. 
 Gross Profit (Loss) 
 Our gross profit (loss) fluctuates significantly from quarter to quarter. Gross profit (loss), calculated as revenue less costs of revenue, has been, and will continue to be, affected by various factors, including fluctuations in the amount and mix of revenue and the amount and timing of investments to expand our customer base. Over the long term, we hope to increase both our gross profit in absolute dollars and gross margin as a percentage of revenue through enhanced operational efficiency and economies of scale. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expense consists of payroll and other related personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, commissions, bonuses, employee benefits, and travel for our sales and marketing personnel. In addition, sales and marketing expense includes trade show costs, amortization of intangibles and other expenses. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in future periods to support the overall growth in our business. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expense consists primarily of payroll and other related personnel costs for engineers and third parties engaged in the design and development of products, third-party software and technologies, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, project material costs, services and depreciation. We expect research and development expense to increase in future periods to support our growth, including our investments in optimization, accuracy and reliability of our platform and other technology improvements to support and drive efficiency in our operations. These expenses may vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue, depending primarily upon when we choose to make more significant investments. 
 33 

General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense consists of payroll and other related personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, employee benefits and expenses for executive management, legal, finance and other costs. In addition, general and administrative expense includes fees for professional services and occupancy costs. We expect to continue to manage and reduce our general and administrative expense associated with scaling our business operations and being a public company, including compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, legal, audit, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities, and other administrative and professional services. 
 Impairment of parent company guarantees 
 Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. 
 Impairment of Goodwill 
 Impairment of goodwill represents impairment chargers as a result of the carrying amount being greater than the fair value. 
 Other Expense, Net 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists primarily of interest on our outstanding borrowings under our outstanding notes payable, convertible senior notes, and financing obligations and accretion on our asset retirement obligations. 
 Gain on Extinguishment of Debt, Net 
 Gain on extinguishment of debt, net consists of income recognized in relation to the prepayment of our outstanding borrowings under our outstanding convertible notes and the write-off of any unamortized debt issuance costs associated with such notes. 
 Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability 
 Change in fair value of derivative liability is related to the revaluation of a derivative feature within a revenue contract, whereby final settlement is indexed to the price per ton of lithium carbonate. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net consists primarily of income from equity investments and foreign exchange gains or losses.

 Percentage is not meaningful 
 Revenue 
 Revenue decreased by 104.4 million, or 78 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a 110.0 million decrease in hardware revenue resulting largely from a decrease in demand for hardware systems due to certain project-related interconnection and financing delays. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in services and other revenue of 5.5 million primarily due to an increase in solar services subscriptions from existing and new customers. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue decreased by 130.9 million, or 85 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in cost of hardware revenue of 132.9 million due to a change in the mix of hardware and service offerings. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in cost of services and other revenue of 2.0 million, primarily due to higher solar cloud service costs. 
 35 

Operating Expenses 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expense decreased by 3.4 million, or 29 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 2.3 million in personnel related expenses mainly due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and sales commissions, and a decrease of 1.1 million in professional services and office-related expenses. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expense decreased by 3.3 million, or 23 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 0.5 million in professional services and other expenses and a decrease of 2.8 million in personnel related expenses as a result of lower headcount. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense increased by 5.3 million, or 24 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a one-time contract cancellation payment of 10.0 million, and an increase of 4.1 million in professional services and other expenses, partially offset by a decrease of 5.6 million in business taxes related to state sales tax liabilities, and a decrease of 1.4 million in personnel costs driven by lower stock-based compensation expense. 
 Impairment of parent company guarantees 
 Credit losses increased by 104.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an write-off of receivables related to certain customer contracts, which provided a parent company guarantee, that were deemed to be uncollectible. 
 Other Expense, Net 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense increased by 0.1 million, or 2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the accretion of the discount on short-term investments of 0.4 million, partially offset by a decrease of 0.3 million in interest on financing obligations. 
 Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability 
 Unrealized losses relating to our derivative liability increased by 5.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the change in the price per ton of lithium carbonate. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net increased by 0.1 million, or 11 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase of 0.1 million in accrued interest income from investments. 
 (Provision for) Benefit from Income Taxes 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , we recorded a provision for income taxes of 0.1 million primarily as a result of foreign and state income tax expense. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of 46 thousand primarily as a result of income tax expense from the gain on extinguishment of debt related to the 2028 Convertible Notes during the second quarter of 2023.

 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net increased by 3.8 million , or 37 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of 2.5 million in interest on our convertible notes, and the accretion of the discount on short-term investments of 1.9 million, partially offset by a decrease of 0.6 million in interest on financing obligations. 
 Gain on Extinguishment of Debt, Net 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 59.4 million gain on extinguishment of debt driven by a 99.8 million payment to extinguish approximately 163.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Convertible Notes. The gain was partially offset by a 0.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt from the repayment of our 2021 Credit Agreement. 
 Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we realized gains of 1.5 million relating to the settlement of our derivative liability related to customers contracts, as compared to unrealized losses of 7.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the change in the price per ton of lithium carbonate. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net of 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was consistent with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 38 

(Provision for) Benefit from Income Taxes 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recorded a provision for income taxes of 0.3 million primarily as a result of state income tax expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 0.4 million provision for income taxes primarily as a result of foreign and state income tax expense from the gain on extinguishment of debt related to our 2028 Convertible Notes during the second quarter of 2023, which was offset by a partial release of our deferred tax asset valuation due to an acquisition during the first quarter of 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service, acquisitions, contractual obligations and other commitments. We assess liquidity in terms of our cash flows from operations and their sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities. To meet our payment service obligations, we must have sufficient liquid assets and be able to move funds on a timely basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated from operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of 75.4 million, which were held for working capital purposes and for investment growth opportunities. As of September 30, 2024, we had net accounts receivable of 92.7 million and our working capital, which we define as current assets less current liabilities, was 20.5 million . We believe that our cash position is sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
 Our business is subject to risks, expenses, and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of commercial operations. The attainment of profitable operations is dependent upon future events, including successfully implementing our new business strategy, hiring and retaining our key executives and personnel with the requisite experience to develop our software and AI-based solutions, obtaining adequate financing to complete our development activities, developing an adequate network of suppliers, and building our customer base. Failure to successfully implement our new business strategy, generate sufficient revenues from our software and services offerings, achieve planned gross margins and operating profitability, control operating costs, or secure additional funding may require us to modify, delay, or abandon some of our planned future expansion or development, or to otherwise enact operating cost reductions available to management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 In the future, we may be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in order to support our continued capital expenditures and operations, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies, this could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our business, growth and results of operations. 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements are linked primarily to the expansion of our software and services offerings in connection with the implementation of our new business strategy. of the Athena platform and supporting applications, including Athena PowerTrack and the use of our balance sheet to improve the terms and conditions associated with the purchase of energy storage systems from our hardware vendors. While we have plans to potentially expand our geographical footprint beyond our current partnerships and enter into joint ventures, those are not required initiatives to achieve our plans.

Financing Obligations 
 We have entered into arrangements wherein we finance the cost of energy storage systems via special purpose entities SPEs we establish with outside investors. These SPEs are not consolidated into our financial statements, but are accounted for as equity method investments. The investors provide us upfront payments through the SPEs. Under these arrangements, the payment by the SPEs to us is accounted for as a borrowing by recording the proceeds received as a financing obligation. The financing obligation is repaid with the future customer payments and incentives received. A portion of the amounts paid to the SPE is allocated to interest expense using the effective interest rate method. Furthermore, we continue to account for the revenues from customer arrangements and incentives and all associated costs despite such systems being legally sold to the SPEs due to our significant continuing involvement in the operations of the energy storage systems. The total financing obligation as of September 30, 2024 was 59.7 million, of which 15.0 million was classified as a current liability.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures Disclosure Controls within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ). Our Disclosure Controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Our Disclosure Controls are also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer Interim CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based on management s evaluation (under the supervision and with the participation of our Interim CEO and our CFO) of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls as of September 30, 2024, our Interim CEO and CFO have concluded that our Disclosure Controls were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting . 
 42 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls 
 Our management, including our Interim CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Furthermore, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Part II - Other Information 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The information with respect to this Item 1 is set forth under Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Report . 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 We may not be able to successfully implement our recently announced new strategy. Our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 On October 1, 2024, we announced the outcome of a strategic review of our business. That review identified, among other things, the need to transition from a business model reliant on hardware resales to a software- and services-focused approach. While we believe this shift is critical to our long-term growth and profitability, the successful implementation of this strategy is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. 
 Our total hardware revenue in the first three quarters of fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023 were 36.7 million and 246.5 million , which comprised 41 of our total revenue in the first three quarters of fiscal year 2024 and 84 of our total revenue in fiscal year 2023, respectively. Our transition away from hardware resales is expected to lead to decreased revenue in the short term, as we work to adjust our revenue streams and reconfigure our customer base. This decline in revenue could strain our cash flow and temporarily worsen our cash position, which in turn may limit our ability to invest in the necessary technologies, talent, and infrastructure required to fully implement the new strategy. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or secure additional funding, we may experience delays in executing our new strategy, which could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 This transition will entail significant operational changes, including reduction of what has historically been the source of most of our revenue (battery resales), adjustments to the way we develop and market our products and services, and realignment of our business processes. These changes could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs and disruptions in our operations, which may negatively impact our ability to effectively scale the software and services segments of our business and achieve our financial and operational targets. Failure to successfully and timely implement these changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Customer acceptance of our software and service offerings is also critical to the success of our new strategy. Existing customers may not adopt our new offerings at the rate we expect, and new customers may not be attracted to our software-based solutions. If market demand for the types of AI-driven clean energy software and services we are developing and will seek to develop in the future does not grow as anticipated, or if competitors offer more attractive products, our revenue growth and market position could be adversely affected. As with all software offerings, there is also a risk that our solutions could be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats or contain errors, bugs, or other issues affecting their functionality, which could negatively affect customer satisfaction and adoption. 
 In addition, executing on the new strategy requires investment in new capabilities and resources, particularly in software development, data management, and AI. We may face challenges in recruiting, retaining, and training employees who have the necessary skill sets to support our new business model. A failure to build or acquire these capabilities in a timely manner could delay the successful execution of the strategy and weaken our competitive position. 
 We may fail to qualify for continued listing on the NYSE, which could make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares. 
 Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol STEM. We are required to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NYSE to maintain such listing, including, among other things, the maintenance of a certain average closing price of our common stock. 
 On August 28, 2024, we received formal notice from the NYSE that we were not in compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of our shares of common stock had fallen below 1.00 per share over a period of 30 consecutive trading days. We subsequently notified the NYSE of our intent to regain compliance with the requirements of Section 802.01C. We are able to regain compliance at any time within the six-month period following receipt of the notice if, on the last trading day of any calendar month during this cure period (or the last trading day of this cure period), we have a closing share price of at least 1.00 and an average closing share price of at least 1.00 over the prior 30 trading-day period. If we do not regain compliance with Section 802.01C within such cure period, the NYSE may commence delisting proceedings. 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the NYSE s continued listing requirements. If our stock price does not increase, we may not be able to meet the standards for continued listing on the NYSE within the 
 44 

compliance period. In the event that we do not regain compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards, we could face material adverse consequences, including: 
 a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock; 
 an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock; 
 loss of confidence from stakeholders, employees and potential business partners; 
 reduced liquidity with respect to our common stock; 
 a determination that our shares are a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules, and which may limit demand for our common stock among certain investors; 
 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and 
 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.

 a. Return of Property . No later than September 25, 2024, if not sooner, Executive shall deliver to the Company all (and will not keep in Executive s possession or control, and will not recreate or deliver to anyone else, any) Confidential Information, as well as all other devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, materials, equipment, customer or client lists or information, or any other documents or property (including all reproductions of the aforementioned items) belonging to the Company or any of its Affiliates or ventures, regardless of whether such items were prepared by Executive. Executive s signature below constitutes Executive s certification under penalty of perjury that Executive will return all documents and other items provided to Executive by the Company or any of its Affiliates, developed or obtained by Executive in connection with his employment with the Company, or otherwise belonging to the Company. Executive understands that the Company, in its sole discretion, may choose to delay any payments due to Executive under this Agreement unless and until Executive complies with this paragraph, but such delay shall not relieve Executive of Executive s other obligations under this Agreement or Executive s release of claims. The obligations in this Section 8(a) are in addition to Executive s obligations set forth in Section 5 of that certain At-Will Employment, Confidential Information, Invention Assignment 

and Arbitration Agreement previously executed by and between Executive and Stem, Inc. (the PIAA ). Executive agrees that Executive will continue to comply with the PIAA. 
 b. Nonsolicitation. For the period of 12 months following the Separation Date (the Restricted Period ), Executive will not directly or indirectly, for the benefit of another business, recruit, hire, solicit, or assist others in recruiting, hiring, or soliciting any person, who is, at the time of the recruiting, hiring, or solicitation, an employee of the Company to leave the employment of the Company, or work for a competing business. This restriction will be limited to persons (1) with whom Executive had contact or business dealings while employed by Company (2) who worked in Executive s business unit or (3) about whom Executive had access to confidential information. If Executive resides in California at the time this Agreement is entered into, then the forgoing restriction shall not be applicable to Executive if it would restrain Executive from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind as such is interpreted under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code 16600. However, conduct involving misappropriation of Company trade secrets will remain prohibited and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or eliminate any rights or remedies the Company would have against Executive under trade secret law, unfair competition law, or other laws applicable in California absent this Agreement, if Executive uses trade secrets or other protected confidential information to help a competitor solicit an employee of the Company. 
 c. Nondisparagement . Executive covenants that he shall not, directly or indirectly, whether in writing, orally or electronically, make any false negative, derogatory or other comment with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity that could reasonably be expected to be detrimental to the Company or any of its Affiliates, their business or operations, or to any of its or their current or former employees, officers or directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement prevents Executive from discussing or disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination or any other conduct that Executive has reason to believe is unlawful. The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, whether in writing, orally or electronically, make any false negative, derogatory or other comment with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity that could reasonably be expected to be detrimental to Executive. Executive understands that the Company s obligations under this paragraph (c) extend only to the Company s current executive officers and members of its Board of Directors and only for so long as each officer or member is an employee or Director of the Company. 
 d. Executive agrees that these restrictions are reasonable in light of the consideration given. Executive was given an opportunity to review these restrictions, advised to consult with an attorney, and agreed to these restrictions as an agreement ancillary to Executive s agreement to protect the Company Confidential Information, which was made in exchange for the Company s provision of confidential information, as well as its agreement to the additional benefits provided in Section 1. The Company is relying on Executive s commitment to comply with the restrictions set forth in this Section 8 in agreeing to pay the consideration set forth in Section 1 and this commitment is ancillary to Executive s agreement to protect the Company s confidential information. Executive acknowledges that in the event of a breach by Executive of these restrictive covenants, the covenants may be enforced by temporary restraining order, preliminary or temporary injunction and permanent injunction, in addition to any other remedies that may be available by law. In that connection, Executive acknowledges that in the event of a breach, the Company may suffer irreparable injury for which there is no adequate legal remedy, in 

part because damages caused by the breach may be difficult to prove with any reasonable degree of certainty. 
 e. Reasonable Cooperation . Beginning on the Separation Date and for twelve (12) months thereafter, Executive agrees that Executive will reasonably cooperate with and assist the Company, its subsidiaries and Affiliates, and any of their respective officers, directors, shareholders or employees (A) concerning requests for information about the business of the Company or its subsidiaries or Affiliates or Executive s involvement and participation therein (including but not limited to requests and subpoenas to provide information or testimony) (B) in connection with any investigation or review by the Company or any federal, state or local regulatory, quasi-regulatory or self-governing authority as any such investigation or review relates to events or occurrences that transpired while Executive were employed by the Company and (C) with respect to transition and succession matters. Executive s cooperation shall include, but not be limited to (taking into account Executive s personal and professional obligations, including those to any new employer or entity to which Executive provide services), being available to meet and speak with officers or employees of the Company and or the Company s counsel at reasonable times and locations, executing accurate and truthful documents, and taking such other actions as may reasonably be requested by the Company and or the Company s counsel to effect the foregoing. Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Company, upon receipt by the Company of suitable documentation, for reasonable and necessary travel and other expenses which Executive may incur on such matters at the specific request of the Company and as approved by the Company in advance and in accordance with its policies and procedures established from time to time. 
 f. LinkedIn and Social Media Profiles . Executive agrees that within five (5) days of the Effective Date, Executive will update his LinkedIn and other social media profiles as necessary to reflect that he no longer works for Stem. 
 9. Confidentiality of Agreement. Except as (a) otherwise required by law or regulation or permitted by Section 10 below, Executive agrees to maintain in complete confidence the existence of this Agreement, the contents and terms of this Agreement, and the consideration for this Agreement (hereinafter collectively referred to as Separation Information ). Except as required by law, Executive may disclose Separation Information only to his immediate family members, the Court in any proceedings to enforce the terms of this Agreement, Executive s attorney(s), and Executive s accountant and any professional tax or financial advisor to the extent that they need to know the Separation Information in order to provide advice on tax treatment or to prepare tax returns and must prevent disclosure of any Separation Information to all other third parties. Executive agrees that he will not publicize, directly or indirectly, any Separation Information. 
 10. Protected Activity Not Prohibited . Executive understands that nothing in this Agreement shall in any way limit or prohibit Executive from engaging for a lawful purpose in any Protected Activity. For purposes of this Agreement, Protected Activity means disclosing, discussing, or making truthful statements about sexual harassment or sexual assault disputes, or any other unlawful or unsafe Company conduct or practices filing a charge or complaint, or otherwise communicating, cooperating, or participating with, any state, federal, or other governmental agency, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the National Labor Relations Board regarding any possible violations of law. However, to the maximum extent permitted by law, Executive agrees that 

Executive is waiving rights to individual relief (including backpay, frontpay, reinstatement or other legal or equitable relief) in any charge, complaint, or lawsuit or other proceeding brought by Executive or on Executive s behalf by any third party, except for any right Executive may have to receive a payment or award from a government agency (and not the Company) for information provided to the government agency or otherwise where prohibited. Notwithstanding any restrictions set forth in this Agreement, Executive understands that he is not required to obtain authorization from the Company prior to disclosing information to, or communicating with, such agencies, nor is Executive obligated to advise the Company as to any such disclosures or communications. Notwithstanding, in making any such disclosures or communications, Executive agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of any information that may constitute Company Confidential Information to any parties other than the relevant government agencies. Executive further understands that Protected Activity does not include the disclosure of any Company attorney-client privileged communications, and that any such disclosure without the Company s written consent shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. Executive understands that pursuant to 18 USC 1833(b), an individual may not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for disclosure of a trade secret (a) made in confidence to a government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law and or (b) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Additionally, an individual suing an employer for retaliation based on the reporting of a suspected violation of law may disclose a trade secret to his or her attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, so long as any document containing the trade secret is filed under seal and the individual does not disclose the trade secret except pursuant to court order. 
 11. No Cooperation . Executive agrees that he will not knowingly counsel, or assist any attorneys or their clients in the presentation or prosecution of any Claims by any third party against any of the Company Releasees, unless under a subpoena or other court order to do so or as related directly to the ADEA waiver in this Agreement. Executive agrees both to immediately notify the Company upon receipt of any such subpoena or court order, and to furnish, within three (3) business days of its receipt, a copy of such subpoena or other court order. If approached by anyone for counsel or assistance in the presentation or prosecution of any Claims against any of the Company Releasees, Executive shall state no more than that he cannot provide counsel or assistance. Nothing in this Agreement, including this section and Section 8 above, shall be construed as requiring Executive to cooperate with the Company with respect to any charge or litigation in which Executive is a plaintiff or complaining party, or any confidential investigation by a competent government agency in which Executive is a witness for or providing support to a charging or complaining party or are asked by a Government Agency to maintain confidentiality. 
 12. Governing Law and Venue Reformation Severability. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its choice of law principles. Venue for any dispute(s) arising from or related to this Agreement shall lie solely, and is convenient, in San Francisco County, California. Executive consents to the choice of law and venue provisions of this Agreement and agrees that Executive will not contest these provisions in any future proceeding(s). 
 In the event Executive breaches any provision of this Agreement , Executive and Company affirm that Company may institute an action to specifically enforce any term or terms of this Agreement. The Company s right to injunctive relief is in addition to any rights otherwise 

available to the the Company, and the parties agree such injunctive relief may be obtained without the necessity of posting any bond.

 13. Breach . In addition to the rights provided in the Attorneys Fees section below, Executive acknowledges and agrees that any material breach of this Agreement, unless such breach constitutes a legal action by Executive challenging or seeking a determination in good faith of the validity of the waiver herein under the ADEA, or the confidentiality provisions hereof shall entitle the Company immediately to recover and cease providing the consideration provided to Executive under this Agreement and to obtain damages, except as provided by law. 
 14. Attorneys Fees .

 15. No Admission of Liability . Executive understands and acknowledges that this Agreement constitutes a compromise and settlement of any and all actual or potential disputed Claims by Executive. No action taken by the Company hereto, either previously or in connection with this Agreement, shall be deemed or construed to be (a) an admission of the truth or falsity of any actual or potential Claims or (b) an acknowledgment or admission by the Company or any of the other Company Releasees of any fault or liability whatsoever to Executive or to any third party, or (c) an admission by the Company or any other of the Company Releasees that they engaged in any wrongful or unlawful act or that the Company or any other Releasee violated any federal or state law or regulation.
