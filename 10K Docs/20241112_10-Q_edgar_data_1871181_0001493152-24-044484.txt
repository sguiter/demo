shares (the Shares Component or of the shares of common
stock of the Company issued and outstanding after the Closing (the Share Exchange ), at per share. 

Mr.
Lin Xiangfeng planned, organized and executed the Share Exchange. Prior to the Share Exchange, Mr. Lin Xiangfeng was the largest shareholder
and sole officer of FDH. He was also the CEO of SKYC but did not own any shares of the Company. The parties involved in the Share Exchange
Agreement are SKYC, FDH and all FDH Shareholders. Mr. Lin Jinshui, an FDH Shareholder, is the father of Mr. Lin Xiangfeng and Mr. Lin
Xiuzi, an FDH Shareholder, is the brother of Mr. Lin Xiangfeng. Other than Mr. Lin Xiangfeng, no third-party played a substantial role
in the agreement. 

FDH
owned (i) of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Shenzhen Dong Sen Mobile Communication Technology Co., Ltd (also known
and doing business as Shenzhen Donxon Mobile Communication Technology Co., Ltd, Donxon ), a company organized under
the laws of the People s Republic of China China or the PRC and (ii) of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Shenzhen Xing Tian Kong Digital Company Limited XTK ), a PRC company. XTK was the holder of of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of Shenzhen Da Sheng Communication Technology Company Limited (also known and do business as Shenzhen
 Dasen Communication Technology Company Limited, Dasen ), a PRC company. Dasen is the holder of of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of Foshan Da Sheng Communication Chain Service Company Limited (also known and do business as Foshan Dasen
 Communication Chain Service Co. Ltd, FDSC ), a PRC company. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, FDH became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, and the Company owned of Donxon, of XKT, of Dasen and of FDSC indirectly through FDH. 

On
February 13, 2018, a change of control occurred, and new officers and directors of the Company were appointed. The name change of Sky
Digital Stores Corp. (SKYC) to Qualis Innovations, Inc. and the was announced on FINRA s Daily
List. Echo Resources LLLP took over control of Qualis owning of the common shares outstanding. Since that event Qualis
did not have any business operations or any assets or liabilities. 

In
July, 2019, John Ballard and Charles Achoa, formed a new company named EMF Medical Devices Inc. for the development, maintenance, marketing
and sale of an electronic device for the treatment of pain that would make use of certain intellectual property interests held by LCMD.
In May 2021 the Company changed its name to mPathix Health Inc. John Ballard is the Company s previous Chief Financial Officer
and Charles Achoa does not participate in any management or board position. 

On
June 28, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement Exchange Agreement by and among mPathix Health, Inc.
(formerly EMF Medical Devices, Inc., a Delaware corporation) mPathix and Qualis. The closing of the transaction (the
 Closing took place on June 29, 2021 (the Closing Date ). On the Closing Date, pursuant to the terms of the
Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares (the Shares of mPathix. In exchange, the Company
issued to the mPathix shareholder s, their designees or assigns, an aggregate of shares of Company common stock (the
 Shares Component or of the shares of common stock of the Company issued and outstanding after the Closing (the
 Share Exchange ), at a valuation of per share, and the Company issued warrants to purchase an additional 
shares warrants issued to the Company s previous CEO and to CreoMed which is beneficially owned by Dr. Joseph
Pergolizzi, the Company s acting CEO and chairman of the board) of the Company s common stock, exercisable for years at
a per share exercise price, subject to adjustment. In connection with the closing of the mPathix acquisition, the officers and
directors of mPathix were appointed as the officers and directors of the Company. On June 29, 2021, the Company issued common
shares for the recapitalization of Qualis in conjunction with the reverse acquisition for a net book value of . 

The
acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization since the stockholders of mPathix owned a
majority of the outstanding shares of the common stock immediately following the completion of the transaction assuming that holders
of 10 of the Public Shares exercise their conversion rights. mPathix was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and,
consequently, the transaction was treated as a recapitalization of mPathix. As a result, Qualis was considered to be the continuation
of the predecessor mPathix. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in the consolidated
financial statements are those of mPathix and are recorded at the historical cost basis of mPathix. Qualis s assets, liabilities
and results of operations will be consolidated with the assets, liabilities and results of operations of mPathix after consummation of
the acquisition.

2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, had a net loss of and , and and for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities of and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with no revenue earned since inception, and a lack of operational history. These matters
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

While
the Company is attempting to expand operations and generate revenues, the Company s cash position may not be significant enough
to support the Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private offering. Management
believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity
for the Company to continue as a going concern. While management believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in
its ability to raise additional funds or transact an asset sale, there can be no assurances to that effect or on terms acceptable to
the Company. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement
its business plan and generate revenues. 

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern.

ASC 250-10-45-17 requires specific financial statement disclosures to include the effect on income from operations, net income, and any
related per-share amounts. 

. The Company has not experienced any cash losses. 

ASC
740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s consolidated financial statements and
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to
be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized
at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax
position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, ASC 740-10 provides guidance on
derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company does not
have a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits.

of Business 

Background 

Qualis
Innovations, Inc. (the Company or Qualis ), formerly known as Hoopsoft Development Corp., Yellowstone Mining
Inc., Sky Digital Stores Corp., and Sky Digital Holdings Corp., was incorporated in the state of Nevada on March 23, 2006. 

In
early 2018, a change of control occurred, new officers and directors of the Company were appointed, and the Company s name was
changed to Qualis Innovations, Inc. 

In
July 2019, John Ballard and Charles Achoa, formed a new company named EMF Medical Devices Inc. for the development, maintenance, marketing
and sale of an electronic device for the treatment of pain that would make use of certain intellectual property interests held by LCMD.
In May 2021 that company changed its name to mPathix Health Inc. 

On
June 28, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement Exchange Agreement by and among mPathix Health, Inc.
(formerly EMF Medical Devices, Inc., a Delaware corporation) mPathix and Qualis. The closing of the transaction (the
 Closing took place on June 29, 2021 (the Closing Date ). On the Closing Date, pursuant to the terms of the
Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares (the Shares of mPathix. In exchange, the Company
issued to the mPathix shareholder s, their designees or assigns, an aggregate of 6,988,300 shares of Company common stock (the
 Shares Component or 93.36 of the shares of common stock of the Company issued and outstanding after the Closing (the
 Share Exchange ), at a valuation of 0.50 per share, and the Company issued warrants to purchase an additional 1,098,830
shares (698,830 warrants issued to the Company s previous CEO and 400,000 to CreoMed which is beneficially owned by Dr. Joseph
Pergolizzi, the Company s previous acting CEO and chairman of the board) of the Company s common stock, exercisable for 10
years at a 0.50 per share exercise price, subject to adjustment. In connection with the closing of the mPathix acquisition, the officers
and directors of mPathix were appointed as the officers and directors of the Company. On June 29, 2021, the Company issued 496,650 common
shares for the recapitalization of Qualis in conjunction with the reverse acquisition for a net book value of 0. 

The
acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization since the stockholders of mPathix owned a
majority of the outstanding shares of the common stock immediately following the completion of the transaction assuming that holders
of 10 of the Public Shares exercise their conversion rights. mPathix was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and,
consequently, the transaction was treated as a recapitalization of mPathix. As a result, Qualis was considered to be the continuation
of the predecessor mPathix. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in the consolidated
financial statements are those of mPathix and are recorded at the historical cost basis of mPathix. Qualis s assets, liabilities
and results of operations will be consolidated with the assets, liabilities and results of operations of mPathix after consummation of
the acquisition. 

18 

The
Company is now the holding company under which mPathix operates. mPathix is a clinical stage company focused on the development, production,
and distribution of pain management and other central nervous system (CNS) based solutions. 

A
key element to the Company s growth strategy is to acquire the rights to or develop existing devices. Large device companies have
increased the minimum market opportunity they require in order to commit marketing resources to their products. As a result, there are
many products that are unsupported by such companies and are currently scheduled to be phased out or sunsetted. Qualis
Innovations believes that it can create significant value by developing or acquiring rights to a portfolio of such products, expanding
their therapeutic uses and/or markets, improving or enhancing such products and dedicating the appropriate amount of marketing and other
resources to maximize the value of the Company s portfolio. 

There
are several key criteria the Company uses when evaluating product opportunities: 

The
 disease or condition largely has been ignored due to lack of interest by other, larger companies and, as a result, overall competition
 in the space is limited. 

The
 device is not selling well for various reasons (including, among other things, poor management, poor reimbursement, improper or no
 available billing codes, inaccurate pricing, and limited and/or poor clinical outcomes) which, Qualis would attempt to eliminate,
 thereby increasing product revenues. 

The
 device should be easy to manufacture, thereby avoiding the need for costly investment by the Company develop products and complicated
 manufacturing facilities. 

There
 should be a large, underserved patient population. The device should have clear regulatory and reimbursement paths with the FDA and
 CMS, respectively (or already be approved). 

The
 device should be relatively easy to distribute/dispense and administer. Most importantly, the product must have a history of limited
 adverse events to patients. 

Our
planned product, which is our sole product in the development pipeline, is SOLACE, a non-invasive medical device that uses electromagnetic
induction to generate deep heat below the surface of the skin to reduce and relieve pain. SOLACE delivers radio frequency (RF)
energy continuously and thereby delivers thermal effects to the tissue and utilizes several differentiated features vs other radio frequency
devices currently on the market. We have not yet finalized development of the planned SOLACE device and have not generated any cash flows
from operations in connection with the planned device. 

The
SOLACE device is based on proprietary high-frequency magnetic induction technology, which we refer to as Electromagnetic Induction EMI ).
Electromagnetic or magnetic induction is the use of electric currents or a derivative of a current in the form of a sound or an acoustic
wave or an electromagnetic energy wave. Administered electric currents or their derivatives have two attributes: (1) pain relief and
(2) regeneration of tissues. 

Magnetic
fields are induced beneath the skin surface to create localized, planar heat in the dermis and deeper muscle, while selectively avoiding
sensitive structures in the epidermis and fat layers. By comparison, our SOLACE device creates currents in discreet planes beneath
 the tissue surface rather than directing energy through the planes and penetrating the epidermis. Therefore, our EMI technology
may provide for shorter duration of treatments and a more comfortable patient experience vs. other energy-based technologies. 

SOLACE 
delivers RF energy via a user-friendly hand-held applicator that allows for targeted and ergonomic application of RF energy to discrete
areas of concern. In contrast, competitor diathermy devices utilize a large drum applicator wherein the RF energy is emitted across a
large surface area. Diathermy is the controlled production of deep heating beneath the skin in the subcutaneous tissue, deep muscles
and joints for therapeutic purposes. There are two types of diathermy devices on the market today: radio or high frequency and microwave.
The drum applicator design limits the tissue targeting to larger joints, while smaller joints or tissue areas (e.g. acromion of the shoulder,
plantar aspect of foot, neck) are largely unaddressed. The hand-held applicator from the SOLACE device provides a small surface
area (approx. 3 cm 2 which is coated in Teflon that can easily be positioned to target smaller body parts providing a
differentiation compared to large drum-type radio frequency devices fail to adequately treat.

Recent
Developments 

We have filed a corporate action notification form
with FINRA to change our name to Family Office of America, Inc., and FINRA is still reviewing such notification form. Once
we have cleared comments with FINRA, we plan to effect the name change of the Company to Family Office of America, Inc. 
with the State of Nevada. We plan to expand our operations to provide business management and financial consulting services to accounting
firms throughout the United States. 

We
have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America GAAP ). 

Impairment
of Assets 

In
the 4th quarter of 2023, the Company determined that the third-party manufacturer of its SOLACE device was unable to deliver the remaining
SOLACE devices and that it may not be economically feasible to pursue the manufacturer for the return of the tooling and deposits. As
a result, the Company determined that the value of the tooling and deposits related to its SOLACE device was 0 and recorded an impairment
of assets totaling 76,008 in the year ended December 31, 2023 which was classified in other expenses in the consolidated Statements
of Operations. 

Financing
Transactions 

Short
Term Note Payable 

The
Company borrows funds from the Company s CEO for working capital purposes from time to time. The Company has recorded the principal
balance due of 9,627 and 9,102 under short term note payable in the accompanying Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, respectively. The Company received advances of 1,025 and 1,025, and 0 and 0 and had repayments of 500 and 500, and 0
and 0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The advance from our CEO was not made pursuant
to any loan agreements or promissory notes, are interest bearing at 10 per annum and due on demand. 

Common
Stock 

In
January 2024, the Company issued 2,000,000 common shares to two (2) affiliates for aggregate gross proceeds of 100,000. 

In
January 2024, the Company issued a total of 10,000,000 common shares valued at 500,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock
on the date of grant) to two affiliates in settlement of a dispute. 

Warrants 

On
April 3, 2023, the Company granted 3,333,333 warrants to purchase 3,333,333 of the Company s common stock to Jim Holt, the Company s
previous CEO, valued at 1,597,635 (based on the Black Scholes valuation model on the date of grant). The options are exercisable for
a period of seven years at 0.03 per share in whole or in part and vest immediately. On December 13, 2023, Mr. Holt, entered into a cancellation
agreement whereby a total of 100,000 warrants, valued at 45,763 (based on the Black Scholes valuation model on the date of grant) have
vested with the remaining 3,233,333 warrants cancelled. The warrants are exercisable for a period of three years at 0.03 per share in
whole or in part and vest immediately. 

Limited
Operating History; Need for Additional Capital 

There
is limited historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. We have not finalized development
of our planned SOLACE device, nor have we generated any cash flow from operations. The Company s cash position may not be sufficient
to support the Company s daily operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is
subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, and possible cost overruns
due to increases in the cost of services. To become profitable and competitive, we must receive additional capital. We have no assurance
that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available, we may be unable to continue operations.

Depending
on the extent of our future growth, we may experience significant strain on our management, personnel, and information systems. We will
need to implement and improve operational, financial, and management information systems. In addition, we are implementing new information
systems that will provide better record-keeping. However, there can be no assurance that our management resources or information systems
will be sufficient to manage any future growth in our business, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates,
among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had an accumulated
deficit of 4,500,372 at September 30, 2024, had working capital of 6,980 at September 30, 2024, had net losses of 22,676 and 70,064,
and 28,572 and 1,748,244 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net cash used in operating
activities of 56,252 and 68,527 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with no revenue earned since inception,
and a lack of operational history. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

While
the Company is attempting to expand operations and increase revenues, the Company s cash position may not be significant enough
to support the Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public offering or an asset
sale transaction. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues
provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While management believes in the viability of its strategy to
generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds or transact an asset sale, there can be no assurances to that effect or
on terms acceptable to the Company. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability
to further implement its business plan and generate revenues. 

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. 

General
 Overall, we had an increase in cash flows for nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 44,273 resulting from cash provided
by financing activities of 100,525, offset partially by cash used in operating activities of 56,252. 

The
following is a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities during the periods indicated:

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operations was 56,252
compared to net cash used in operations of 68,527 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in operations was primarily
due to a net loss of 70,064 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the changes in operating assets and liabilities of 13,812,
primarily due to accounts payable and accrued expenses of 12,991 and other current liabilities of 821. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operations was 68,527. Net cash used in operations was primarily due to a
net loss of 1,748,244 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the changes in operating assets and liabilities of 44,152, primarily
due to other current assets of 92,170, offset partially by accounts payable and accrued expenses of 16,826 and other current liabilities
of 31,192. In addition, net cash used in operating activities includes adjustments to reconcile net profit from depreciation expense
of 12,826, and warrants issued for services of 1,622,739. 

24 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in investing was
none. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities For nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing was primarily
due to proceeds from issuance of common stock for cash of 100,000. For nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing
was none. 

Financing
 We expect that our current working capital position, together with our expected future cash flows from operations will
be insufficient to fund our operations in the ordinary course of business, anticipated capital expenditures, debt payment requirements
and other contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months. However, this belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject
to numerous risks, and there can be no assurance that we will not require additional funding in the future. 

We
have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights or
technologies or any other material capital expenditures. However, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of and/or investments in
products, technologies, capital equipment or improvements or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions and/or
investments in the future. Accordingly, we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any such acquisitions
and/or investments. We may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Due to the ongoing global
economic crisis, we believe it may be difficult to obtain additional financing if needed. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing,
it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our shareholders,
in the case of equity financing.

in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported accurately, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and within the required time periods, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, who is also our acting Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report
(September 30, 2024), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer, who is also our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective to enable us to accurately record, process, summarize and report certain information required
to be included in the Company s periodic SEC filings within the required time periods, and to accumulate and communicate to our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
