 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Highlights of Operating Results Edison International is the ultimate parent holding company of SCE and Edison Energy, LLC, doing business as Trio ("Trio"). SCE is an investor-owned public utility primarily engaged in the business of supplying and delivering electricity to an approximately 50,000 square mile area across Southern, Central and Coastal California. Trio is a global energy advisory firm providing integrated sustainability and energy solutions to commercial, industrial and institutional customers. Trio's business activities are currently not material to report as a separate business segment. Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses core earnings (loss) internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings (loss) are also used when communicating with investors and analysts regarding Edison International's earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the company's performance from period to period. Core earnings (loss) are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings (loss) are defined as earnings attributable to Edison International shareholders less non-core items. Non-core items include income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as write downs, asset impairments and other income and expense related to changes in law, outcomes in tax, regulatory or legal proceedings, and exit activities, including sale of certain assets and other activities that are no longer continuing. Beginning July 1, 2023, SCE implemented a customer-funded wildfire self-insurance program. With the commencement of this program, Edison International and SCE no longer consider claims-related losses for wildfires to be representative of ongoing earnings and treat such costs as non-core items. For additional information on the customer-funded self-insurance program, see "Management Overview Customer-Funded Self-Insurance" in the 2023 MD A.

 1 Charges of 4 million related to claims from wildfires ignited prior to July 1, 2023 are included in core earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Core earnings in periods before the third quarter of 2023 have not been recast to exclude these charges. 2 SCE and Edison International Parent and Other non-core items are tax-effected at an estimated statutory rate of approximately 28 ; customer revenues (claims) for EIS insurance contract are tax-effected at the federal statutory rate of 21 . 
 Edison International's third quarter 2024 earnings increased 361 million from the third quarter of 2023, resulting from an increase in SCE's earnings of 363 million and an increase in Edison International Parent and Other's loss of 2 million. SCE's higher net income consisted of 54 million of higher core earnings and 309 million of lower non-core loss. Edison International Parent and Other's loss increased due to 3 million of higher core loss, partially offset by 1 million of lower non-core loss. Edison International's earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 125 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting from an increase in SCE's earnings of 161 million and an increase in Edison International Parent and Other's loss of 36 million. SCE's higher net income consisted of 161 million of higher core earnings. Edison International Parent and Other's loss increased due to 35 million of lower earnings in non-core items and 1 million increase in core loss. The increase in SCE's core earnings for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to higher revenue authorized in Track 4 and an increase in the authorized rate of return resulting from the cost of capital adjustment mechanism, partially offset by higher interest expense. The increase in core earnings for the nine months period was also due to recognition of previously unrecognized return on rate base related to emergency restoration related capital expenditures. Edison International Parent and Other's core loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were both in line with the same periods in the prior year.

See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies" for further information. 
 See "Results of Operations" for discussion of SCE's and Edison International Parent and Other's results of operations. 2025 General Rate Case As discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K, SCE filed its 2025 GRC application with the CPUC in May 2023, for the four-year period 2025 2028. In its application, SCE requested that the CPUC authorize a test year 2025 revenue requirement of approximately 10.3 billion. This represents a 1.9 billion, or 23 increase over the approximately 8.4 billion 2024 revenue requirement adopted in Track 4, prior to adjustments for updated operations and maintenance escalation rates, the CPUC's decisions to adopt SCE's 2023 to 2025 cost of capital, and the expanded customer-funded self-insurance for wildfire-related claims. In February 2024, intervenors to the 2025 GRC proceeding, including Cal Advocates and The Utility Reform Network ("TURN"), submitted testimony in response to SCE's application. Cal Advocates and TURN recommended reductions to SCE's requests for load growth investments, infrastructure replacement, targeted undergrounding of conductors, and other areas of SCE's application. Cal Advocates in its testimony proposed a test year 2025 revenue requirement of approximately 9.3 billion, representing an increase of approximately 11 over the 2024 revenue requirement adopted in Track 4, before the adjustments described above. While TURN did not calculate a test year 2025 revenue requirement in connection with its proposals in its testimony,

Table of Contents 
 SCE estimates that TURN's proposals would result in a test year 2025 revenue requirement of approximately 12 over the 2024 revenue requirement adopted in Track 4, before the adjustments described above. In June 2024, following amendments and other revisions to rebuttal testimony, SCE updated its 2025 revenue requirement request to 10.5 billion, and proposed post-test year revenue requirement increases of approximately 670 million, 750 million and 730 million in 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively. The updated 2025 revenue requirement included a 220 million increase associated with the cost of capital adjustment authorized by the CPUC in a separate proceeding, which was subsequently modified by a CPUC decision in October 2024, as discussed in " Cost of Capital Trigger." In July 2024, the CPUC issued a decision approving SCE's request in the 2025 GRC to extend the wildfire customer-funded self-insurance through the 2025 GRC period. In October 2024, the CPUC approved the establishment of a memorandum account to track changes in the revenue requirement between January 1, 2025, and the implementation date of the final decision, in the event that the decision is not issued in time for implementation by January 2025. While SCE and certain parties have entered into stipulations to resolve certain contested areas in the 2025 GRC, SCE cannot predict the revenue requirement the CPUC will ultimately authorize or forecast the timing of a final decision. Cost of Capital Trigger As discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K, the cost of capital adjustment mechanism set by the CPUC provides for an adjustment to SCE's authorized cost of capital that, when triggered, will impact SCE's results of operations and cash flows. In 2023, the cost of capital adjustment mechanism was triggered and resulted in an increase to SCE's CPUC-authorized ROE from 10.05 to 10.75 effective January 1, 2024. The resulting increase to SCE's 2024 GRC-related revenue requirement was 201 million. The cost of capital adjustment mechanism was not triggered in 2024. In October 2024, the CPUC issued a decision modifying the cost of capital adjustment mechanism that changes the mechanism's adjustment ratio from 50 to 20 effective on January 1, 2025, and also applies to the increase that most recently triggered it in 2023. As a result, SCE's 2025 CPUC-authorized ROE will be adjusted to 10.33 . The decision reduces SCE's updated 2025 GRC-related revenue requirement by approximately 117 million. For further information, see " 2025 General Rate Case." For additional information on the cost of capital adjustment mechanism, see "Business SCE Overview of Ratemaking Pro cess CPUC" in the 2023 Form 10-K. Capital Program Total capital expenditures (including accruals) were 4.0 billion and 3.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K, SCE forecasts total capital expenditures ranging from 32.2 billion to 37.5 billion for 2024 2028, and weighted average annual rate base from 43.0 billion to 60.6 billion for 2024 2028. These capital program and rate base projections incorporate the amounts requested in the 2025 GRC application and do not reflect subsequent updates included in SCE's amended and revised rebuttal testimony. For further information regarding the capital expenditures, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Capital Investment Plan" below and "Management Overview Capital Program" in the 2023 MD A. In May 2023, the CAISO released its 2022 2023 Transmission Plan based on the CPUC's projections that more than 40 gigawatts of new resources need to be added in California by 2032. As the incumbent transmission owner for a portion of these transmission projects, SCE expects to construct projects requiring capital investment of at least 2.0 billion, most of which will be incurred beyond 2028. In May 2024, the CAISO released its 2023 2024 Transmission Plan which identified four additional transmission projects expected to be constructed by SCE with anticipated capital expenditures of approximately 40 million in 2027 and 48 million in 2029. In addition to projects awarded to incumbent transmission owners, the CAISO identified projects eligible for competitive solicitation. On May 20, 2024, SCE, in association with Lotus Infrastructure Global Operations, LLC ("Lotus"), was selected

Table of Contents 
 as the approved project sponsor for a 30-mile overhead transmission line project connecting San Diego and Orange Counties. The project is expected to be in-service in 2032. Subject to contract finalization with the CAISO and Lotus, under the terms of the commercial arrangement with Lotus, Lotus is expected to finance and construct the project. Upon the in-service date, SCE will purchase the entire project from Lotus for approximately 325 million, subject to certain adjustments, and lease 25 of the transmission capability to Lotus. Under the proposed lease agreement, Lotus will pay approximately 81 million in prepaid rent as well as 25 of the ongoing operations and maintenance costs. As a result, SCE expects to place approximately 244 million into its transmission rate base in 2032. Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events As discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K, multiple lawsuits and investigations related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events have been initiated against SCE and Edison International. SCE has previously entered into settlements with a number of local public entities, subrogation and individual plaintiffs in the TKM and Woolsey Fire litigations and under the SED Agreement. As of October 22, 2024, in addition to the outstanding claims of approximately 440 of the approximately 15,000 initial individual plaintiffs, there were alleged and potential claims of certain public entity plaintiffs, including CAL OES, outstanding. Through September 30, 2024, SCE has accrued estimated losses of 9.9 billion, recoveries from insurance of 2.0 billion, all of which have been collected, and expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of 440 million, 376 million of which has been collected, related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events claims. The after-tax net charges to earnings recorded through September 30, 2024 have been 5.4 billion. Estimated losses for the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation are based on a number of assumptions and are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Actual losses incurred may be higher or lower than estimated based on several factors, including the uncertainty in estimating damages that have been or may be alleged. For instance, SCE will receive additional information with respect to damages claimed as the claims mediation and trial processes progress. Other factors that can cause actual losses incurred to be higher or lower than estimated include the ability to reach settlements and the outcomes of settlements reached through the ongoing claims mediation processes, uncertainties related to the impact of outcomes of wildfire litigation against other parties and increasingly negative jury sentiments in general litigation, uncertainties related to the sufficiency of insurance held by plaintiffs, uncertainties related to the litigation processes, including whether plaintiffs will ultimately pursue claims, uncertainty as to the legal and factual determinations to be made during litigation, including uncertainty as to the contributing causes of the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, the complexities associated with fires that merge and whether inverse condemnation will be held applicable to SCE with respect to damages caused by the Montecito Mudslides, and the uncertainty as to how these factors impact future settlements. As of September 30, 2024, SCE had paid 9.3 billion under executed settlements and had 78 million to be paid under executed settlements, including 58 million to be paid under the SED Agreement, related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. After giving effect to all payment obligations under settlements entered into through September 30, 2024, Edison International's and SCE's best estimate of expected losses for remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events was 491 million. Edison International and SCE may incur a material loss in excess of amounts accrued in connection with the remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. CPUC-Jurisdictional Rate Recovery In August 2023, SCE filed an application to seek CPUC-jurisdictional rate recovery of prudently incurred losses related to the Thomas Fire, the Koenigstein Fire and the Montecito Mudslides. SCE also sought recovery of approximately 65 million in restoration costs in the proceeding. In August 2024, SCE and Cal Advocates filed a joint motion in the proceeding seeking 

 8 

Table of Contents 
 approval of the TKM Settlement Agreement between SCE and Cal Advocates. One party to the proceeding, the Wild Tree Foundation, has opposed the TKM Settlement Agreement. Under the TKM Settlement Agreement, if approved by the CPUC, SCE will be authorized to recover 60 , or approximately 1.6 billion, of approximately 2.7 billion of losses, consisting of approximately 1.3 billion of uninsured claims paid as of May 31, 2024, and 0.3 billion of costs, composed of legal and financing costs incurred as of May 31, 2024 and estimated ongoing financing costs. SCE will also be authorized to recover 60 of claims paid and related costs incurred after May 31, 2024, other than for 125 million of uninsured claims and related financing costs which SCE waived its right to seek recovery of under the SED Agreement. Subject to approval of the TKM Settlement Agreement, SCE will request approval from the CPUC to finance the amounts authorized under the TKM Settlement Agreement through the issuance of securitized bonds. Further, SCE will be authorized to recover approximately 55 million of approximately 65 million in restoration costs incurred. In the TKM Settlement Agreement, SCE also agreed to 50 million of shareholder-funded wildfire- and public safety-related system enhancements. If the TKM Settlement Agreement is approved, SCE will be allowed to permanently exclude any after-tax charges to equity associated with the costs disallowed or funded by shareholders in the TKM Settlement Agreement and the debt issued to finance those costs from SCE's CPUC regulatory capital structure. In October 2024, SCE filed an application to seek CPUC-jurisdictional rate recovery of 5.4 billion of prudently incurred losses related to the Woolsey Fire, consisting of approximately 4.4 billion of uninsured claims paid as of August 31, 2024 and 1.0 billion of associated costs, composed of legal and financing costs incurred as of August 31, 2024 and estimated ongoing financing costs. SCE is also seeking recovery of approximately 84 million in restoration costs in the proceeding. Because the CPUC's decision in a cost recovery proceeding involving SDG E arising from several 2007 wildfires in SDG E's service area is the only directly comparable precedent available, SCE believes that there is substantial uncertainty regarding how the CPUC will interpret and apply its prudency standard to an investor-owned utility in wildfire claims related cost-recovery proceedings for fires ignited prior to the adoption of AB 1054 on July 12, 2019. Accordingly, while the CPUC has not made a determination regarding SCE's prudency relative to any of the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, SCE is unable to conclude, at this time, that uninsured CPUC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events are probable of recovery through electric rates. If, and when, the CPUC adopts a final decision approving the TKM Settlement Agreement, SCE will record a regulatory asset for recoveries permitted under the agreement. SCE does not expect to record a regulatory asset for recoveries related to the Woolsey Fire at that time. SCE will continue to evaluate the facts and circumstances of the Woolsey Fire cost recovery proceeding in determining if and when a regulatory asset may be recorded.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SCE SCE's results of operations are derived mainly through two sources: Earning activities representing revenue authorized by the CPUC and the FERC, which is intended to provide SCE with a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs and earn a return on its net investment in generation, transmission and distribution assets. The annual revenue requirements are composed of authorized operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, taxes and a return consistent with the capital structure. Also, included in earnings activities are revenue or penalties related to incentive mechanisms, other operating revenue, and regulatory charges or disallowances.

 Cost-recovery activities representing CPUC- and FERC- authorized balancing accounts, which allow for recovery of specific project or program costs, subject to reasonableness review or compliance with upfront standards, as well as non-bypassable rates collected for SCE Recovery Funding LLC. Cost-recovery activities include rates which provide recovery, subject to reasonableness review of, among other things, fuel costs, purchased power costs, public purpose related-program costs (including energy efficiency and demand-side management programs), certain operation and maintenance expenses (including vegetation management and wildfire insurance), and repayment of bonds and financing costs of SCE Recovery Funding LLC. SCE earns no return on these activities. 
 The following table is a summary of SCE's results of operations for the periods indicated. Three months ended September 30, 2024 versus September 30, 2023 Three months ended September 30, 2024 Three months ended September 30, 2023 Cost- Cost- Earning Recovery Total Earning Recovery Total (in millions) Activities Activities Consolidated Activities Activities Consolidated Operating revenue 2,606 2,582 5,188 2,387 2,300 4,687 Purchased power and fuel 1,898 1,898 1,988 1,988 Operation and maintenance 685 679 1,364 552 302 854 Wildfire-related claims, net of insurance recoveries 479 479 Wildfire Insurance Fund expense 36 36 54 54 Depreciation and amortization 698 12 710 650 15 665 Property and other taxes 163 4 167 133 5 138 Total operating expenses 1,582 2,593 4,175 1,868 2,310 4,178 Operating income (loss) 1,024 (11) 1,013 519 (10) 509 Interest expense (390) (13) (403) (353) (16) (369) Other income, net 102 24 126 102 26 128 Income before income taxes 736 736 268 268 Income tax expense (benefit) 95 95 (1) (1) Net income 641 641 269 269 Less: Preference stock dividend requirements 39 39 30 30 Net income available to common stock 602 602 239 239 Earning Activities Earning activities were primarily affected by the following: Higher operating revenue of 219 million is primarily due to: An increase in CPUC-related revenue of 188 million due to higher revenue authorized in Track 4 and an increase in the authorized rate of return resulting from the cost of capital adjustment mechanism. See "Management Overview Cost of Capital Trigger" for more information. An increase in CPUC-related revenue of 24 million due to higher wildfire mitigation expenses authorized for recovery in 2024. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Regulatory Proceedings" for more information. 
 Higher operation and maintenance expense of 133 million is primarily due to: 
 An increase in wildfire mitigation expense of 99 million due to higher amounts authorized in Track 4, and the recognition of previously deferred costs (offset in revenue above). Severance costs of 47 million recorded in 2024 due to current and probable reductions in workforce.

 Charges for wildfire-related claims, net of insurance recoveries, were 479 million in 2023, primarily related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and Other Wildfires. See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides." Lower wildfire insurance fund amortization expense of 18 million due to the change in the estimated life of the Wildfire Insurance Fund in the first quarter of 2024, which increased the amortization period of SCE's contributions in 2024. See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for further information. Higher depreciation and amortization expense of 48 million primarily due to an increase in plant balances. Higher property and other taxes of 30 million primarily due to an increase in assessed property value. Higher interest expense of 37 million primarily due to higher interest rates and additional long-term borrowings. See "Income Taxes" below for the explanation of the 96 million increase in income tax expense. 
 Cost-Recovery Activities Operating revenue and the corresponding operating expenses in cost-recovery activities were primarily affected by the following: Lower purchased power and fuel expense of 90 million, primarily due to lower purchased power and gas prices, partially offset by increase in purchased power volume. Higher operation and maintenance expense of 377 million primarily due to: An increase in vegetation management expense of 261 million due to higher amounts authorized in Track 4 and the recognition of previously deferred costs. An increase in expense of 53 million primarily due to higher expected uncollectible expenses in 2024. An increase in expense of 39 million related to public purpose programs. An increase in expense of 36 million related to higher transmission access charges.

 Charges for wildfire-related claims, net of insurance recoveries, were 614 million and 575 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and Other Wildfires. See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides." Lower wildfire insurance fund amortization expense of 50 million due to the change in the estimated life of the Wildfire Insurance Fund, which increased the amortization period of SCE's contributions in 2024. See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for further information.

Higher property and other taxes of 56 million primarily due to increased assessed property value and the recognition of 8 million of previously deferred wildfire mitigation and emergency restoration related property tax in 2024 (offset in revenue above) . Higher interest expense of 176 million primarily due to increased interest rates on long-term debt and balancing account overcollections, as well as additional long-term borrowings. Higher other income of 41 million primarily due to increased equity allowance for funds used during construction and increased interest rates applied to balancing account undercollections. Higher preference stock dividend requirements of 41 million primarily due to increased preference stock outstanding. See "Income Taxes" below for the explanation of the 2 million decrease in income tax expense. 
 Cost-Recovery Activities Operating revenue and the corresponding operating expenses in cost-recovery activities were primarily affected by the following: Lower purchased power and fuel costs of 313 million, primarily due to lower purchased power and gas prices, partially offset by increase in purchased power volume. Higher operation and maintenance costs of 412 million primarily due to: An increase in vegetation management expense of 501 million due to higher amounts authorized in Track 4 and the recognition of previously deferred costs. An increase in expense of 129 million related to public purpose programs. An increase in expense of 125 million primarily due to higher expected uncollectible expenses in 2024. An increased expense of 93 million related to higher transmission access charges. In May 2023, SCE recognized 205 million of previously deferred wildfire insurance premium that provided coverage for the last six months of 2020. A decrease in insurance costs of 192 million due to SCE's expanded use of customer-funded self-insurance. See "Management Overview Customer-Funded Self-Insurance" in the 2023 Form 10-K. A decrease in expense of 48 million due to lower recovery of previously deferred wildfire mitigation costs in 2024 compared to 2023.

 Higher interest expense of 12 million primarily due to recovery of expense associated with AB 1054 Excluded Capital Expenditures financed through securitization. 
 Supplemental Operating Revenue Information As a result of the CPUC-authorized decoupling mechanism, SCE revenues are not affected by changes in volume of retail electricity sales. Income Taxes Compared to the same periods in 2023, SCE's income tax expense increased by 96 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and was comparable to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In both periods, the key drivers were higher pre-tax income partially offset by higher flow-through tax benefits. The effective tax rates were 12.9 and (0.4) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates were 6.7 and 7.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. SCE's effective tax rate is below the federal statutory rate of 21 for 2024 and 2023 primarily due to the CPUC's flow-through ratemaking treatment for the current tax benefit arising from certain property-related and other temporary differences, which reverse over time. The accounting treatment for these temporary differences results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that would otherwise be recorded to deferred tax expense/benefit. See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 8. Income Taxes" for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective income tax rates. Edison International Parent and Other Results of operations for Edison International Parent and Other include amounts from other subsidiaries that are not reportable segments, as well as intercompany eliminations. Loss from Operations The following table summarizes the results of Edison International Parent and Other: 

Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Edison International Parent and Other net loss (64) (57) (181) (131) Less: Preferred stock dividend requirements 22 27 65 79 Edison International Parent and Other net loss attributable to common shareholders (86) (84) (246) (210) The net loss attributable to common shareholders from operations of Edison International Parent and Other for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was in line with the same period in 2023. The net loss attributable to common stock from operations of Edison International Parent and Other increased 36 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lack of earnings from an EIS insurance contract and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower preferred stock dividend. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SCE SCE's ability to operate its business, fund capital expenditures, and implement its business strategy is dependent upon its cash flow and access to the bank and capital markets. SCE's overall cash flows fluctuate based on, among other things, its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates, changes in commodity prices and volumes, collateral requirements, interest obligations, dividend payments to and equity contributions from Edison International, obligations to preference shareholders, and the outcome of tax, regulatory and legal matters.

Table of Contents 
 In the next 12 months, SCE expects to fund its cash requirements through operating cash flows, and capital market and bank financings. SCE also has availability under its credit facility to fund cash requirements. SCE also expects to issue additional debt for general corporate purposes, and to finance, and refinance debt issued for, payment of claims and expenses related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. During the first nine months of 2024, SCE issued a total of 4.3 billion of first and refunding mortgage bonds. For further details, see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5. Debt and Credit Agreements." In May 2024, SCE issued 350 million of preference stock. The proceeds were used in June 2024 to redeem all outstanding shares of SCE's Series E Preference Stock. For further details, see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 13. Equity." SCE's credit ratings may be affected if, among other things, regulators fail to successfully implement AB 1054 in a consistent and credit supportive manner, or the Wildfire Insurance Fund is depleted by claims from catastrophic wildfires. Credit rating downgrades increase the cost and may impact the availability of short-term and long-term borrowings, including commercial paper, credit facilities, bond financings or other borrowings. In addition, some of SCE's power procurement contracts and environmental remediation obligations would require SCE to pay related liabilities or post additional collateral if SCE's credit rating were to fall below investment grade. For further details, see " Margin and Collateral Deposits." For restrictions on SCE's ability to pay dividends, see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies SCE Dividends" in the 2023 Form 10-K. Available Liquidity At September 30, 2024, SCE had cash on hand of 91 million and approximately 2.8 billion available to borrow on its 3.4 billion revolving credit facility. In May 2024, SCE extended its credit facility through May 2028. The aggregate maximum principal amount may be increased up to 4.0 billion, provided that additional lender commitments are obtained. SCE also has standby letters of credit with total capacity of 625 million, and the unused amount was 429 million as of September 30, 2024. For further details, see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5. Debt and Credit Agreements." SCE may finance balancing account undercollections and working capital requirements to support operations and capital expenditures with commercial paper, its credit facilities or other borrowings, subject to availability in the bank and capital markets. As necessary, SCE will utilize its available liquidity, capital market financings, other borrowings or parent company contributions to SCE equity in order to meet its obligations as they become due, including costs related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. For further information, see "Management Overview Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides." Debt Covenant SCE's credit facilities and term loan require a debt to total capitalization ratio as defined in the applicable agreements of less than or equal to 0.65 to 1. At September 30, 2024, SCE's debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.57 to 1. At September 30, 2024, SCE was in compliance with all financial covenants that affect access to capital. Regulatory Proceedings Wildfire-related Regulatory Proceedings In response to the increase in wildfire activity, and faster progression of and increased damage from wildfires across SCE's service area and throughout California, SCE has incurred wildfire mitigation, wildfire insurance and wildfire and drought restoration related spending at levels significantly exceeding amounts authorized in SCE's GRCs.

 2021 GRC Wildfire Mitigation Memorandum Account Balances In June 2022, SCE filed an application with the CPUC requesting reasonableness review of the incremental costs incurred in 2021 related to non-WCCP wildfire mitigation and vegetation management activities, requesting a total revenue requirement of approximately 327 million plus ongoing capital-related revenue requirement. In March 2024, the CPUC issued a decision fully authorizing SCE's requested revenue requirement. The revenue requirement is being recovered in rates over 12 months starting June 1, 2024. In October 2023, SCE requested authority to recover a revenue requirement of 384 million, including interest, associated with 2022 operations and maintenance and capital expenditures above levels authorized in wildfire mitigation accounts and the vegetation management balancing account. In July 2024, the CPUC approved SCE's request for interim rate recovery of 210 million of this revenue requirement, subject to refund. The revenue requirement for the interim rate recovery is being recovered in rates over 17 months starting October 1, 2024. A final decision for the total authorized revenue requirement is expected in the second quarter of 2025 according to the CPUC adopted schedule. 2020 Emergency Wildfire Restoration As discussed in the 2023 MD A, SCE filed a catastrophic event memorandum account application in 2022 primarily related to restoration efforts related to multiple 2020 wildfires. In May 2024, the CPUC issued a decision approving the recovery of SCE's capital request of 312 million and operation and maintenance expenses of 200 million, resulting in a revenue requirement of 191 million plus ongoing capital-related revenue requirement. The revenue requirement is being recovered in rates over a 12-month period starting October 1, 2024. Multi-year Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Filing ("WMCE Filing") In April 2024, SCE filed its WMCE Filing, seeking to recover incremental operating and maintenance expenses of 320 million and incremental capital expenditures of 702 million, primarily associated with 2019 2023 WCCP capital expenditures recorded in the wildfire risk mitigation balancing account, 2023 operations and maintenance and capital expenditures incremental to amounts authorized in wildfire mitigation accounts and the vegetation management balancing account, storm-related costs associated with certain 2020 2022 events recorded in the catastrophic event memorandum account, and certain wildfire liability insurance premium expenses recorded to the wildfire expense memorandum account, which were denied without prejudice in a previous decision. In July 2024, the CPUC adopted a schedule with a proposed decision expected in the third quarter of 2025. ERRA Trigger Application SCE recovers its fuel and purchased power-related costs through various balancing accounts, primarily the ERRA and the PABA. SCE sets rates based on an annual forecast of the costs that it expects to incur during the subsequent year. The aggregate overcollection in the ERRA and the eligible portion of the PABA at April 30, 2024 resulted in SCE triggering an established mechanism, which required SCE to file an expedited application for the CPUC's approval to reduce bundled service generation rates (see "Business SCE Overview of Ratemaking Process" in the 2023 Form 10-K for further information about the trigger mechanism). The CPUC approved this application in August 2024, resulting in a 742 million reduction in the revenue requirement, returned through rates over a 12-month period starting October 1, 2024. 2025 FERC Formula Rate Annual Update In June 2024, SCE provided its preliminary 2025 annual transmission revenue requirement update to interested parties. The update proposes a 2025 transmission revenue requirement of 1.3 billion, which is a 221 million, or 20 increase from the 2024 annual rates. The increase is primarily due to 2024 rates including a return of a prior year overcollection. SCE expects to file its 2025 annual update with the FERC by December 1, 2024, with the proposed rates effective January 1, 2025.

 Capital Investment Plan Major Transmission and Utility Owned Storage Projects Riverside Transmission Reliability Project As discussed in the 2023 MD A, the City of Norco filed a petition for modification ("PFM") to modify the CPUC decision approving the project and reopen the record to reconsider full undergrounding during 2023. In March 2024, the CPUC denied the PFM. In May 2024, the Riverside City Council voted to move forward with the original scope of the project and SCE restarted its work on the project. Alberhill System Project As discussed in the 2023 MD A, a final CPUC decision remains pending. In June 2024, the CPUC issued an addendum to its 2017 Final Environmental Impact Report, concluding its California Environmental Quality Act review. The project is now seeking final CPUC approval to begin construction. SCE is expecting the final CPUC decision in mid-2025. Eldorado-Lugo-Mohave Upgrade Project As discussed in the 2023 MD A, additional work is required to mitigate the impact of the project on nearby natural gas transmission lines and a further PFM or an amendment to an existing PFM is expected to be filed to include reasonable and prudent costs of the mitigation work. SCE expects the project to be in service in 2025, subject to the completion of environmental agency review of the mitigation work. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Capital Investment Plan" in the 2023 Form 10-K for further information. Utility Owned Storage As discussed in the 2023 MD A, in October 2021, SCE contracted with Ameresco, Inc. ("Ameresco") for the construction of utility owned energy storage projects at three sites in SCE's service territory that have an aggregate capacity of 537.5 MW, consisting of a 225 MW project, a 200 MW project and a 112.5 MW project, with an in-service date of August 1, 2022. The 200 MW and 112.5 MW projects went in-service during the third quarter of 2024 and Ameresco has advised SCE that it currently expects the 225 MW project to be in-service before the end of 2024. SCE believes that there is risk of delay beyond Ameresco's projected in-service date. Decommissioning of San Onofre As discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K, SCE filed the 2021 NDCTP with the CPUC in February 2022 to request reasonableness review of approximately 570 million (SCE share in 2022 dollars) of recorded San Onofre Units 2 and 3 decommissioning costs incurred during the period 2018 to 2020. In May 2023, SCE agreed to a 30 million disallowance related to the 2021 NDCTP under a settlement with the relevant intervenors and recognized the disallowance in 2023. In August 2024, the CPUC approved the 2021 NDCTP, as modified by the settlement agreement. In September 2024, SCE made a contribution to the non-qualified nuclear decommissioning trust to effectuate the disallowance. For more information, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources SCE Decommissioning of San Onofre" in the 2023 Form 10-K. In the third quarter of 2024, SCE updated its decommissioning cost estimate for decommissioning activities to be completed at San Onofre Units 2 and 3 to 3.0 billion (SCE share is 2.3 billion) in 2024 dollars. For more information, see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." The decommissioning cost estimate included costs through the expected decommissioning completion date, currently estimated to be in 2056 for San Onofre Units 2 and 3. SCE intends to file its updated decommissioning cost estimate with the CPUC before the end of 2024. Margin and Collateral Deposits Certain derivative instruments, power and energy procurement contracts and other contractual arrangements contain collateral requirements. In addition, certain environmental remediation obligations require financial assurance that may be in

Table of Contents 
 the form of collateral postings. Future collateral requirements may differ from the requirements at September 30, 2024 due to the addition of incremental power and energy procurement contracts with collateral requirements, if any, the impact of changes in wholesale power and natural gas prices on SCE's contractual obligations, and the impact of SCE's credit ratings falling below investment grade. The table below provides the amount of collateral posted by SCE to its counterparties as well as the potential collateral that would have been required as of September 30, 2024, if SCE's credit rating had been downgraded to below investment grade as of that date. The table also provides the potential collateral that could be required due to adverse changes in wholesale power and natural gas prices over the remaining lives of existing power and fuel derivative contracts. In addition to amounts shown in the table, power and fuel contract counterparties may also institute new collateral requirements, applicable to future transactions to allow SCE to continue trading in power and fuel contracts at the time of a downgrade or upon significant increases in market prices. Furthermore, SCE may also be required to post up to 50 million in collateral in connection with its environmental remediation obligations, within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year in which a downgrade below investment grade occurs.

The requirements vary throughout the period and are generally lower at the end of the month. 3 Incremental collateral requirements were based on potential changes in SCE's forward positions as of September 30, 2024 due to adverse market price movements over the remaining lives of the existing power and fuel derivative contracts using a 95 confidence level. Edison International Parent and Other In the next 12 months, Edison International expects to fund its net cash requirements through cash on hand, dividends from SCE, and capital market and bank financings. Edison International may finance its ongoing cash requirements, including dividends, working capital requirements, payment of obligations, and capital investments, including capital contributions to subsidiaries, with short-term or other financings, subject to availability in the bank and capital markets. In the second quarter of 2024, Edison International Parent issued 500 million of 5.45 senior notes due in 2029. For further details, see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5. Debt and Credit Agreements." At September 30, 2024, Edison International Parent and Other had cash on hand of 109 million and 1.5 billion available to borrow on its 1.5 billion revolving credit facility. In May 2024, Edison International extended its credit facility through May 2028. The aggregate maximum principal amount may be increased up to 2.0 billion, provided that additional lender commitments are obtained. For further information, see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5. Debt and Credit Agreements." Edison International Parent and Other's liquidity and its ability to pay operating expenses and pay dividends to preferred and common shareholders are dependent on access to the bank and capital markets, dividends from SCE, realization of tax benefits and its ability to meet California law requirements for the declaration of dividends. For information on the California law requirements on the declaration of dividends, see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of

Table of Contents 
 Significant Accounting Policies SCE Dividends" in the 2023 Form 10-K. Edison International intends to maintain its target payout ratio of 45 55 of SCE's core earnings, subject to the factors identified above. Edison International's ability to declare and pay common dividends may be restricted under the terms of its Series A and Series B Preferred Stock. For further information, see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 14. Equity" in the 2023 Form 10-K. Edison International Parent's credit facility requires a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio as defined in the applicable agreements of less than or equal to 0.70 to 1. At September 30, 2024, Edison International's consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.63 to 1. At September 30, 2024, Edison International Parent was in compliance with all financial covenants that affect access to capital. Edison International Parent's credit ratings may be affected if, among other things, regulators fail to successfully implement AB 1054 in a consistent and credit supportive manner, or the Wildfire Insurance Fund is depleted by claims from catastrophic wildfires. Credit rating downgrades increase the cost and may impact the availability of short-term and long-term borrowings, including commercial paper, credit facilities, note financings or other borrowings. Edison International Income Taxes Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 On August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law. The law imposes a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax ("CAMT") on adjusted financial statement income ("AFSI") of corporations with average AFSI exceeding 1.0 billion over a specified 3-year period. The CAMT was effective beginning January 1, 2023. Based on the current interpretation of the law and historical financial data, Edison International estimates that it will exceed the 1.0 billion threshold and be subject to CAMT on its consolidated federal tax returns beginning in 2026. SCE expects to be subject to CAMT on its stand-alone Federal return beginning in 2025. The law also includes significant extensions, expansions, and enhancements of numerous energy-related investment tax credits, as well as creating new credits applicable to electricity production which may apply to SCE's capital expenditures. Under the IRA, SCE expects to generate investment tax credits related to its utility owned storage projects, which will accrue to the benefit of its customers. Historical Cash Flows SCE

Table of Contents 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities The following table summarizes major categories of net cash for operating activities as provided in more detail in SCE's consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Nine months ended September 30, Change in cash flows (in millions) 2024 2023 2024/2023 Net income 1,319 1,117 Non-cash items 1 2,173 2,173 Subtotal 3,492 3,290 202 Changes in cash flow resulting from working capital 2 (834) (1,120) 286 Regulatory assets and liabilities 1,557 705 852 Wildfire-related claims 3 (304) (75) (229) Other noncurrent assets and liabilities 4 126 (67) 193 Net cash provided by operating activities 4,037 2,733 1,304 
 1 Non-cash items include depreciation and amortization, equity allowance for funds used during construction, deferred income taxes, Wildfire Insurance Fund amortization expenses and other. 2 Changes in working capital items include receivables, accrued unbilled revenue, inventory, amortization of prepaid expenses, accounts payable, derivative assets and liabilities and other current assets and liabilities. 3 The amount in 2024 represents payments of 636 million for 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and 342 million for Other Wildfires, partially offset by an increase in wildfire estimated losses of 674 million. The amount in 2023 is primarily related to payments of 747 million for 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and 16 million for Post-2018 Wildfires, partially offset by an increase in wildfire estimated losses of 689 million. 4 Includes nuclear decommissioning trusts. See "Nuclear Decommissioning Activities" below for further information. The amount in 2024 also includes cash received from customers to fund certain construction projects and cash received for a state incentive program to pass on to customers. The amount in 2023 also includes outflow from increase in wildfire insurance receivables. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the following: Net income and non-cash items increased in 2024 by 202 million primarily due to higher revenue authorized in Track 4, an increase in the authorized rate of return resulting from the cost of capital adjustment mechanism, and recognition of previously unrecognized return on rate base related to emergency restoration related capital expenditures, partially offset by higher interest expense. The net outflows in cash resulting from working capital were 834 million and 1,120 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash outflows for both 2024 and 2023 were primarily due to the increases in customer receivables and unbilled revenue for both years. Net cash provided by regulatory assets and liabilities, including changes in net undercollections recorded in balancing accounts, was 1,557 million and 705 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. SCE has a number of balancing and memorandum accounts, which impact cash flows based on differences between timing of collection through rates and incurring expenditures. Cash inflows in 2024 and 2023 were both due to recovery of prior year undercollections. The higher inflow in 2024 compared to 2023 was driven by higher prior year undercollections implemented into rates in 2024 and higher sales volume due to hotter weather in 2024.

In addition, SCE had a net redemption of nuclear decommissioning trust investments of 70 million and 94 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See "Nuclear Decommissioning Activities" below for further discussion. Nuclear Decommissioning Activities SCE's consolidated statements of cash flows include nuclear decommissioning activities, which are reflected in the following line items: 

Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities: Net earnings from nuclear decommissioning trust investments 33 77 SCE's decommissioning costs (162) (167) Net cash provided by investing activities: Proceeds from sale of investments 3,558 3,223 Purchases of investments (3,488) (3,129) Net cash (outflow) inflow (59) 4 Net cash used in operating activities relates to interest and dividends less administrative expenses, taxes and SCE's decommissioning costs. Investing activities represent the purchase and sale of investments within the nuclear decommissioning trusts, including the reinvestment of earnings from nuclear decommissioning trust investments. The net cash impact reflects timing of decommissioning payments 162 million and 167 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively) and reimbursements to SCE from the nuclear decommissioning trust 151 million and 171 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively). The net cash outflow in 2024 also includes 19 million of tax benefits received and a 30 million disallowance under the 2021 NDCTP (For further details, see " Decommissioning of San Onofre), both contributed by SCE to the decommissioning trust.

 Regulatory assets: non-current Regulatory liabilities: current Current portion of long-term debt 1 Other current liabilities Long-term debt 1 1 The bondholders have no recourse to SCE. The long-term debt balance is net of unamortized debt issuance costs. Variable Interest in VIEs that are not Consolidated Power Purchase Agreements SCE has PPAs that are classified as variable interests in VIEs, including agreements through which SCE provides the natural gas to fuel the plants, fixed price contracts for renewable energy, and resource adequacy agreements that, upon the seller's election, include the purchase of energy at fixed prices. SCE has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since it does not control the commercial and operating activities of these entities. Since payments for capacity are the primary source of income, the most significant economic activity for these VIEs is the operation and maintenance of the power plants, which SCE does not perform. As of the balance sheet date, the carrying amount of assets and liabilities included in SCE's consolidated balance sheet that relate to involvement with VIEs that are not consolidated, result from amounts due under the PPAs. Under these contracts, SCE recovers the costs incurred through demonstration of compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term power procurement plans. SCE has no residual interest in the entities and has not provided or guaranteed any debt or equity support, liquidity arrangements, performance guarantees, or other commitments associated with these contracts other than the purchase commitments described in Note 12 of the 2023 Form 10-K. As a result, there is no significant potential exposure to loss to SCE from its variable interest in these VIEs. The aggregate contracted capacity dedicated to SCE from these VIE projects was 5,103 Megawatt(s) ("MW") and 3,443 MW at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The amounts that SCE paid to these projects were million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. These amounts are recoverable in customer rates, subject to reasonableness review. Unconsolidated Trusts of SCE SCE Trust II, Trust III, Trust IV, Trust V, Trust VI, Trust VII and Trust VIII were utilized in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2023 and 2024, respectively, for the exclusive purpose of issuing the , , , , , and trust preference securities, respectively ("trust securities"). The trusts are VIEs. SCE has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs as it does not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the trusts. SCE Trust II, Trust III, Trust IV, Trust V, Trust VI, Trust VII and Trust VIII issued to the public trust securities in the face amounts of million, million, million, million, million, million and million (cumulative, liquidation amounts of per share), respectively, and of common stock each to SCE.

The Series G, Series H, Series J, Series K, Series L, Series M and Series N Preference Stock and the corresponding trust securities do not have a maturity date. Upon any redemption of any shares of the Series G, Series H, Series J, Series K, Series L, Series M or Series N Preference Stock, a corresponding dollar amount of trust securities will be redeemed by the applicable trust. The applicable trust will make distributions at the same rate and on the same dates on the applicable series of trust securities, if and when the SCE board of directors declares and makes dividend payments on the related Preference Stock. The applicable trust will use any dividends it receives on the related Preference Stock to make its corresponding distributions on the applicable series of trust securities. If SCE does not make a dividend payment to any of these trusts, SCE would be prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock. SCE has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of the trust securities and trust distributions, if and when SCE pays dividends on the related Preference Stock. The Trust II, Trust III, Trust IV, Trust V, Trust VI and Trust VII balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of investments of million, million, million, million, million and million in the Series G, Series H, Series J, Series K, Series L and Series M Preference Stock, respectively, million, million, million, million, million and million of trust securities, respectively, and each of common stock.

The difference between the authorized amounts as determined in SCE's rate cases, adjusted for balancing and memorandum account activities, and the recorded flow-through items also result in increases or decreases in regulatory assets with a corresponding impact on the effective tax rate to the extent that recorded deferred amounts are expected to be recovered in future rates.

The largest of the November 2018 fires in SCE's territory, known as the "Woolsey Fire," originated in Ventura County and burned acreage in both Ventura and Los Angeles Counties. According to CAL FIRE, the Woolsey Fire burned almost acres, destroyed an estimated structures, damaged an estimated structures and resulted in confirmed fatalities. additional fatalities are alleged to have been associated with the Woolsey Fire. As described below, multiple lawsuits related to the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires and the Woolsey Fire have been initiated against SCE and Edison International. Some of the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires lawsuits claim that SCE and Edison International have responsibility for the damages caused by debris flows and flooding in Montecito and surrounding areas in January 2018 (the "Montecito Mudslides," and collectively with the Thomas Fire and the Koenigstein Fire, "TKM") based on a theory alleging that SCE has responsibility for the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires and further alleging that the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires proximately caused the Montecito Mudslides. According to Santa Barbara County initial reports, the

 structures, damaged an estimated structures, and resulted in confirmed fatalities, with additional fatalities presumed but not officially confirmed. The Thomas Fire, the Koenigstein Fire, the Montecito Mudslides and the Woolsey Fire are each referred to as a "2017/2018 Wildfire/ Mudslide Event," and, collectively, referred to as the "2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events." As of September 30, 2024, SCE had paid billion under executed settlements, had million to be paid under executed settlements, including million to be paid under the SED Agreement (as defined below), and had million of estimated losses for remaining alleged and potential claims reflected on its consolidated balance sheets related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. As of the same date, SCE had assets for expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of million on its consolidated balance sheets and had exhausted expected insurance recoveries related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. The estimated losses for the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events do not include estimates of potential losses related to certain potential public entity plaintiff claims, including the California Governor's Office of Emergency Service's ("Cal OES") claim in the TKM litigation, for which the statute of limitations has been tolled, and for an individual plaintiff demand received in the first quarter of 2024 that has not been substantiated, as losses from these alleged and potential claims are not estimable at this time. Edison International and SCE may incur a material loss in excess of amounts accrued in connection with the remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. Due to the number of uncertainties and possible outcomes related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation, Edison International and SCE cannot estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred. Estimated losses for the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation are based on a number of assumptions and are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Actual losses incurred may be higher or lower than estimated based on several factors, including the uncertainty in estimating damages that have been or may be alleged and uncertainty in estimating settlement outcomes. For instance, SCE will receive additional information with respect to damages claimed as the claims mediation and trial processes progress. Other factors that can cause actual losses incurred to be higher or lower than estimated include the ability to reach settlements and the outcomes of settlements reached through the ongoing claims mediation processes, uncertainties related to the impact of outcomes of wildfire litigation against other parties and increasingly negative jury sentiments in general litigation, uncertainties related to the sufficiency of insurance held by plaintiffs, uncertainties related to the litigation processes, including whether plaintiffs will ultimately pursue claims, uncertainty as to the legal and factual determinations to be made during litigation, including uncertainty as to the contributing causes of the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, the complexities associated with fires that merge and whether inverse condemnation will be held applicable to SCE with respect to damages caused by the Montecito Mudslides, and the uncertainty as to how these factors impact future settlements. The CPUC and FERC may not allow SCE to recover uninsured losses through electric rates if it is determined that such losses were not prudently incurred. See "Loss Estimates for Third Party Claims and Potential Recoveries from Insurance and through Electric Rates" below for additional information. External Investigations and Internal Review The VCFD and CAL FIRE have jointly issued reports concerning their findings regarding the causes of the Thomas Fire and the Koenigstein Fire. The reports did not address the causes of the Montecito Mudslides. SCE has also received a non-final redacted draft of a report from the VCFD regarding Woolsey Fire (the "Redacted Woolsey Report"). SCE cannot predict when the VCFD will release its final report regarding the Woolsey Fire. The CPUC's Safety and Enforcement Division ("SED") conducted investigations to assess SCE's compliance with applicable rules and regulations in areas impacted by the Thomas, Koenigstein and Woolsey Fires. As discussed below, in October 2021, SCE and the SED executed the SED Agreement (as defined below) to resolve the SED's investigations into the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events.

 individual plaintiffs, there were alleged and potential claims of certain public entity plaintiffs, including the CAL OES, outstanding. The litigation could take a number of years to be completely resolved because of the complexity of the matters and number of plaintiffs. On October 4, 2018, the Los Angeles Superior Court denied Edison International's and SCE's challenge to the application of inverse condemnation to SCE with respect to the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires and, on February 26, 2019, the California Supreme Court denied SCE's petition to review the Superior Court's decision. In April 2022, following a stipulated judgment entered against SCE in the TKM litigation, SCE filed an appeal related to inverse condemnation in the California Court of Appeal, which was denied. In August 2024, the California Supreme Court denied SCE's petition to review the California Court of Appeal's decision. In January 2019, SCE filed a cross-complaint against certain local public entities alleging that failures by these entities, such as failure to adequately plan for flood hazards and build and maintain adequate debris basins, roads, bridges and other channel crossings, among other things, caused, contributed to or exacerbated the losses that resulted from the Montecito Mudslides. These cross-claims in the Montecito Mudslides litigation were not released as part of the Local Public Entity Settlements (as defined below). Several of these cross-claims have been settled or dismissed. Settlement of Claims In 2019, SCE paid million to a number of local public entities to resolve those parties' collective claims arising from the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events (the "Local Public Entity Settlements"). SCE has also settled all fire suppression claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. In 2020, Edison International and SCE entered into an agreement (the "TKM Subrogation Settlement") under which all of the insurance subrogation plaintiffs' in the TKM litigation (the "TKM Subrogation Plaintiffs") collective claims arising from the Thomas Fire, Koenigstein Fire or Montecito Mudslides have been resolved. Under the TKM Subrogation Settlement, SCE paid the TKM Subrogation Plaintiffs an aggregate of billion in October 2020 and also agreed to pay for each dollar in claims to be paid by the TKM Subrogation Plaintiffs to their policy holders on or before July 15, 2023, up to an agreed upon cap. In 2021, Edison International and SCE entered into an agreement (the "Woolsey Subrogation Settlement") under which all of the insurance subrogation plaintiffs' in the Woolsey Fire litigation (the "Woolsey Subrogation Plaintiffs") collective claims arising from the Woolsey Fire have been resolved. Under the Woolsey Subrogation Settlement, SCE paid the Woolsey Subrogation Plaintiffs an aggregate of billion in March and April 2021. SCE has also agreed to pay for each dollar in claims to be paid by the Woolsey Subrogation Plaintiffs to their policy holders on or before July 15, 2023, up to an agreed upon cap. As of October 22, 2024, SCE has also entered into settlements with approximately indi vidual plaintiffs in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, SCE entered into settlements with individual plaintiffs in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation under which it agreed to pay an aggregate of approximately million, billion and billion, respectively, to those individual plaintiffs. In the first, second, and third quarters of 2024, SCE entered into settlements with individual plaintiffs in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation under which it agreed to pay an aggregate of approximately million, million, and million, respectively, to those individual plaintiffs.

 and of outstanding individual plaintiff claims in the TKM litigation and Woolsey Fire litigation, respectively. Edison International and SCE did not admit wrongdoing or liability as part of any of the settlements described above. Other claims and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events remain. SCE continues to explore reasonable settlement opportunities with other plaintiffs in the outstanding 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation. SED Agreement In October 2021, SCE and the SED executed an agreement (the "SED Agreement") to resolve the SED's investigations into the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and three other 2017 wildfires for, among other things, aggregate costs of million. The million in costs was composed of a million fine to be paid to the State of California General Fund, million of shareholder-funded safety measures, and an agreement by SCE to waive its right to seek cost recovery in CPUC-jurisdictional rates for million and million of third-party uninsured claims payments (and related financing costs) in the TKM litigation and the Woolsey Fire litigation, respectively. The SED Agreement provides that SCE may, on a permanent basis, exclude from its ratemaking capital structure any after-tax charges to equity or debt borrowed to finance costs incurred under the SED Agreement. The SED Agreement also imposes other obligations on SCE, including reporting requirements and safety-focused studies. SCE's obligations under the SED Agreement commenced on August 15, 2022, when CPUC approval of the SED Agreement became final and non-appealable. SCE did not admit imprudence, negligence or liability with respect to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events in the SED Agreement. Loss Estimates for Third Party Claims and Potential Recoveries from Insurance and through Electric Rates At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Edison International's and SCE's consolidated balance sheets included fixed payments to be made under executed settlement agreements and accrued estimated losses of million and million, respectively, for claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. The following table presents changes in estimated losses since December 31, 2023: Increase in accrued estimated losses Amounts paid ) Balance at September 30, 2024 2 
 1 At December 31, 2023, million in current liabilities, wildfire-related claims, on Edison International's and SCE's consolidated balance sheets consisted of million of settlements executed and million of short term payables under the SED Agreement in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. At December 31, 2023, the million included in deferred credits and other liabilities, wildfire-related claims, on Edison International's and SCE's consolidated balance sheets included Edison International's and SCE's best estimate of expected losses for remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events of million, million of long term payables under the SED Agreement and estimated losses related to the Other Wildfires of million. 2 At September 30, 2024, million in current liabilities, wildfire-related claims, on Edison International's and SCE's consolidated balance sheets consisted of million of settlements executed in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, million of short term payables under the SED Agreement, and million of settlements executed in connection with the Other Wildfires. At September 30, 2024, the million included in deferred credits and other liabilities, wildfire-related claims, on Edison International's and SCE's consolidated balance sheets included Edison International's and SCE's best estimate of expected losses for remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events of million, million of long term payables under the SED Agreement and estimated losses related to the Other Wildfires of million.

 Expected revenue from FERC customers ) ) ) Total pre-tax charge Income tax benefit ) ) ) Total after-tax charge For events that occurred in 2017 and early 2018, principally the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires and Montecito Mudslides, SCE had billion of wildfire-specific insurance coverage, subject to a self-insured retention of million per occurrence. For the Woolsey Fire, SCE had an additional billion of wildfire-specific insurance coverage, subject to a self-insured retention of million per occurrence. In total, through September 30, 2024, SCE has accrued estimated losses of billion, has paid or is obligated to pay approximately billion in settlements, including million to be paid under the SED Agreement, and has recovered billion from its insurance carriers in relation to the claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. Recovery of SCE's losses realized in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events in excess of available insurance is subject to approval by regulators. Under accounting standards for rate-regulated enterprises, SCE defers costs as regulatory assets when it concludes that such costs are probable of future recovery in electric rates. SCE utilizes objectively determinable evidence to form its view on probability of future recovery. The only directly comparable precedent in which a California investor-owned utility sought recovery for uninsured wildfire claims related costs is San Diego Gas Electric's ("SDG E") requests for cost recovery related to 2007 wildfire activity, where the FERC allowed recovery of all FERC-jurisdictional wildfire claims related costs while the CPUC rejected recovery of all CPUC-jurisdictional wildfire claims related costs based on a determination that SDG E did not meet the CPUC's prudency standard ("SDG E Decision"). As a result, while SCE does not agree with the CPUC's decision, it believes that the CPUC's interpretation and application of the prudency standard to SDG E creates substantial uncertainty regarding how that standard will be applied to an investor-owned utility in wildfire cost-recovery proceedings for fires ignited prior to July 12, 2019. SCE will continue to evaluate the probability of recovery based on available evidence, including judicial, legislative and regulatory decisions, including any CPUC decisions illustrating the interpretation and/or application of the prudency standard when making determinations regarding recovery of uninsured wildfire-related costs. While the CPUC has not made a determination regarding SCE's prudency relative to any of the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, SCE is unable to conclude, at this time, that uninsured CPUC-jurisdictional wildfire claims related costs related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events are probable of recovery through electric rates. SCE would record a regulatory asset at the time it obtains sufficient information to support a conclusion that recovery is probable. In August 2023, SCE filed an application to seek CPUC-jurisdictional rate recovery of prudently incurred losses related to the Thomas Fire, the Koenigstein Fire and the Montecito Mudslides, consisting of uninsured claims and associated costs, including legal costs and financing costs. In August 2024, SCE and the California Public Advocates Office filed a joint motion in the cost recovery proceeding seeking approval of a settlement agreement between SCE and the California Public Advocates Office (the "TKM Settlement Agreement"). One party to the proceeding, the Wild Tree Foundation, has opposed the TKM Settlement Agreement. Under the TKM Settlement Agreement, if approved by the CPUC, SCE will be authorized to recover , or approximately billion, of approximately billion of losses, consisting of approximately billion of uninsured claims paid as of May 31, 2024, and billion of costs, composed of legal and financing costs incurred as of May 31, 2024 and estimated ongoing financing costs. SCE will also be authorized to recover of claims paid and related costs incurred after May 31,

 million of uninsured claims and related financing costs which SCE waived its right to seek recovery of under the SED Agreement. In October 2024, SCE filed an application (the "Woolsey Application") to seek CPUC-jurisdictional rate recovery of billion of prudently incurred losses related to the Woolsey Fire, consisting of approximately billion of uninsured claims paid as of August 31, 2024 and billion of associated costs, composed of legal and financing costs incurred as of August 31, 2024 and estimated ongoing financing costs. If, and when, the CPUC adopts a final decision approving the TKM Settlement Agreement, SCE will record a regulatory asset for recoveries permitted under the agreement. SCE does not expect to record a regulatory asset for recoveries related to the Woolsey Fire at that time. SCE will continue to evaluate the facts and circumstances of the Woolsey Fire cost recovery proceeding in determining if and when a regulatory asset may be recorded. Through the operation of its FERC Formula Rate, and based upon the precedent established in SDG E's recovery of FERC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs, SCE believes it is probable it will recover its FERC-jurisdictional costs related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and has recorded total expected recoveries of million within the FERC balancing account. This amount is the FERC portion of the total estimated losses accrued and is subject to refund. As of September 30, 2024, collections have reduced the regulatory assets remaining in the FERC balancing account to million. FERC recoveries are subject to refund, and SCE will continue to evaluate the probability of recovery of FERC-jurisdictional wildfire and mudslide related costs related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events based on available evidence, including any FERC decisions to allow or disallow recovery, or require refund, of FERC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs based on a state regulator's decision on whether to permit recovery of related costs. Through September 30, 2024, SCE has recorded million gross, and million net of depreciation, in incremental property, plant and equipment in relation to restoration costs related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. These assets would be impaired to the extent restoration costs are permanently disallowed by the CPUC in cost recovery proceedings. Under the TKM Settlement Agreement, if approved by the CPUC, SCE will be authorized to recover approximately million of approximately million in incremental restoration costs, inclusive of operations and maintenance expenses, incurred related to the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires. SCE is seeking recovery of approximately million in incremental restoration costs, inclusive of operations and maintenance expenses, incurred related to the Woolsey Fire in the Woolsey Application. Other Wildfires In addition to the Thomas, Koenigstein and Woolsey Fires, several other wildfires that ignited in and after 2017 impacted portions of SCE's service territory. Wildfires, where SCE's equipment has been and may be further alleged to be associated with the fire's ignition, that originated in Southern California (i) in 2017 or 2018, other than the Thomas, Koenigstein and Woolsey Fires, are referred to collectively as the "Other 2017/2018 Wildfires," (ii) after 2018 are referred to collectively as the "Post-2018 Wildfires." The Post-2018 Wildfires and the Other 2017/2018 Wildfires are referred to collectively as the "Other Wildfires." During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SCE accrued estimated losses of million for claims related to the Other Wildfires, against which SCE has recorded expected recoveries from insurance of million and expected recoveries through electric rates of million. The resulting net charge to earnings was million million after-tax). Through September 30, 2024, SCE has recorded total estimated losses of billion, expected recoveries from insurance and third parties of million and expected recoveries through electric rates of million related to the Other Wildfires claims. The after-tax net charges to earnings recorded through September 30, 2024 have been million. As of September 30 , 2024, SCE has paid or is obligated to pay approximately million under executed settlements related to the Other Wildfires and Edison International's and SCE's estimated losses for remaining alleged and potential claims (established at the low end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses) related to the Other Wildfires was

 million. A s of the same date, SCE had assets for expected recoveries through insurance and third parties of million and through electric rates of million on its consolidated balance sheets related to the Other Wildfires. Other 2017/2018 Wildfires Numerous claims related to the Other 2017/2018 Wildfires have been initiated against SCE. The SED is also conducting investigations with respect to some Other 2017/2018 Wildfires. 2017 Creek Fire The Creek Fire originated near Sylmar in Los Angeles County in December 2017 and burned approximately acres, destroyed an estimated structures, damaged an estimated structures, and resulted in civilian injuries. While the United States Forest Service's ("USFS") January 2018 report of investigation concluded that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power ("LADWP") long-span transmission lines slapping together in high winds resulted in arcing and ignition of the fire, in August 2024, the USFS issued a supplemental report concluding that the fire was caused by SCE power lines. In 2023, the USFS dismissed its claim against LADWP and filed a claim against SCE to recover over million for fire-suppression costs incurred by the USFS and environmental damage to U.S. lands. A trial in the USFS litigation is currently set for July 2025. Other than for the claims of 8 individual plaintiffs related to two properties that were damaged by the Creek Fire, SCE has entered into settlements or settlements in principle on all claims filed by individual and subrogation plaintiffs who filed complaints against SCE related to the fire. A damages-only bench trial is currently set for June 2025 in one of the outstanding individual plaintiff cases. SCE expects to obtain and review additional information and materials in the possession of third parties during the course of its internal reviews and the litigation process. SCE has accrued charges for potential losses relating to the Creek Fire. The accrued charges correspond to the low end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred in connection with the Creek Fire and are subject to change as additional information becomes available. While Edison International and SCE may incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued, they cannot estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred. SCE has recorded recoveries from insurance of million related to the Creek Fire. No additional insurance is available because wildfire insurance for the period in which the Creek Fire was ignited has been almost fully exhausted as a result of the TKM litigation. Post-2018 Wildfires Numerous claims related to the Post-2018 Wildfires have been initiated against SCE and Edison International. The SED is also conducting investigations with respect to several Post-2018 Wildfires. Expected recoveries from insurance recorded for the Post-2018 Wildfires are supported by SCE's insurance coverage for multiple policy years. While Edison International and SCE may incur material losses in excess of the amounts accrued for certain of the Post-2018 Wildfires, Edison International and SCE expect that any losses incurred in connection with any such fire will be covered by insurance, subject to self-insured retentions and co-insurance, and expect that any such losses after expected recoveries from insurance and through electric rates will not be material. 2019 Saddle Ridge Fire The "Saddle Ridge Fire," originated in Los Angeles County in October 2019 and burned approximately acres, destroyed an estimated structures, damaged an estimated structures, and resulted in fatality and injuries to fire fighters. In August 2023, SCE received a signed report of investigation from the Los Angeles Fire Department ("LAFD"), in which the LAFD stated with respect to the Saddle Ridge Fire that the cause of ignition was unintentional, the form of heat was undetermined, the item first ignited was undetermined and the material type first ignited was undetermined. The LAFD report noted that no other competent ignition sources other than SCE's transmission lines were found in the specific origin area of the Saddle Ridge Fire. There are currently no trials scheduled in the Saddle Ridge Fire litigation. Based on pending litigation and without considering insurance recoveries, it is reasonably possible that SCE will incur a material loss in connection with the Saddle Ridge Fire, but the range of reasonably possible losses that could be incurred cannot be estimated

 acres in Los Angeles County, destroyed an estimated homes, commercial property and minor structures, damaged an estimated homes and minor structures, and resulted in injuries to firefighters. In addition, fire authorities have estimated suppression costs at approximately million. An investigation into the cause of the Bobcat Fire was led by the USFS. In May 2023, SCE received a report of investigation from the USFS, in which the USFS finds that the Bobcat Fire was caused when an SCE electrical wire made contact with a tree limb. The SED has concluded its investigation of the Bobcat Fire and found no violations of its rules and regulations by SCE related to the Bobcat Fire. The United States of America has filed a claim against SCE and one of its contractors to recover fire-suppression costs, property and natural resource losses, and emergency response costs. A jury trial in this litigation is currently set for July 2025. Individual plaintiffs have also filed complaints against SCE related to the Bobcat Fire, and a trial is currently set for July 2025. SCE expects to obtain and review additional information and materials in the possession of third parties during the course of its internal reviews and the litigation process. SCE has accrued material charges for potential losses relating to the Bobcat Fire. The accrued charges correspond to the low end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred in connection with the Bobcat Fire and are subject to change as additional information becomes available. While Edison International and SCE may incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued, they cannot estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred. 2022 Coastal Fire The "Coastal Fire" originated in Orange County in May 2022 and burned approximately acres. The Orange County Fire Authority ("OCFA") has reported that the Coastal Fire destroyed residential structures and damaged residential structures. firefighters also reportedly sustained minor injuries. In addition, fire authorities have estimated suppression costs at approximately million. While SCE's investigation remains ongoing, SCE's information reflects that a SCE circuit in the area experienced an anomaly (a relay) approximately 2 minutes prior to the reported time of the fire. An investigation into the cause of the Coastal Fire was led by the OCFA. The OCFA has retained SCE equipment in connection with its investigation. In September 2024, SCE received a report of investigation from the OCFA, in which the OCFA finds that the Coastal Fire was unintentionally caused by sparks from overhead SCE electrical equipment igniting vegetation under the equipment. One damages only trial for a household of individual plaintiffs in the Coastal Fire litigation is currently scheduled for March 2025. SCE expects to obtain and review additional information and materials in the possession of third parties during the course of its internal reviews and the litigation process. SCE has accrued material charges for potential losses relating to the Coastal Fire. The accrued charges correspond to the low end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred in connection with the Coastal Fire and are subject to change as additional information becomes available. While Edison International and SCE may incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued, they cannot estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred. 2022 Fairview Fire The "Fairview Fire" originated in Riverside County in September 2022 and burned approximately acres. CAL FIRE has reported that the Fairview Fire destroyed residential structures, damaged residential structures, and destroyed or damaged minor structures. CAL FIRE also reported civilian fatalities, civilian injury and injuries to responding fire personnel. In addition, fire authorities have estimated suppression costs at million. While SCE's investigation remains ongoing, SCE's information reflects that a SCE circuit in the area experienced an anomaly (a relay) approximately 8 minutes prior to the reported start time of the fire. In November 2023, SCE received a report of investigation conducted by CAL FIRE, in which CAL FIRE finds that the Fairview Fire was caused when a sagging SCE electrical conductor came in contact with a communication line, causing sparks to fall and ignite surrounding vegetation. In July 2024, the SED issued a notice of violation alleging that SCE failed to comply with clearance requirements with respect to its

 million and million, respectively, for claims related to the Other Wildfires. Edison International and SCE have accrued the low end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses for each of the Other Wildfires as no amount within the range of reasonably possible losses for each such fire appears at this time to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range. While Edison International and SCE may incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued, they cannot estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred. Increase in accrued estimated losses Amounts paid ) Balance at September 30, 2024 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Edison International's and SCE's consolidated statements of income included charges for the estimated losses (established at the low end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses), net of expected recoveries from insurance and customers, related to the Other Wildfires as follows, respectively:

 Recovery of SCE's losses realized in connection with the Other Wildfires in excess of available insurance is subject to approval by regulators. The CPUC and FERC may not allow SCE to recover uninsured losses through electric rates, including by requiring refund of amounts recovered, if it is determined that such losses were not prudently incurred. Under accounting standards for rate-regulated enterprises, SCE defers costs as regulatory assets when it concludes that such costs are probable of future recovery in electric rates. SCE utilizes objectively determinable evidence to form its view on the probability of future recovery. As of September 30, 2024, SCE has recorded total expected recoveries related to the Other Wildfires claims of million within the Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account and Risk Management Balancing Account and million within the FERC balancing account. As discussed above, the SDG E Decision is evidence of a California investor-owned utility seeking recovery for uninsured wildfire-related costs and FERC allowing recovery of all FERC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs while the CPUC rejected recovery of all CPUC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs based on a determination that the utility did not meet the CPUC's prudency standard. In light of the SDG E Decision, as with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, SCE is unable to conclude, at this time, that uninsured CPUC-jurisdictional costs related to the Other 2017/2018 Wildfires are probable of recovery through electric rates. The SDG E Decision was prior to the adoption of AB 1054 on July 12, 2019, after which date AB 1054 clarified that the CPUC must find a utility to be prudent if the utility's conduct related to the ignition was consistent with actions that a reasonable utility would have undertaken in good faith under similar circumstances, at the relevant point in time, and based on the information available at that time. Further, utilities with a valid safety certification at the time of the relevant wildfire will be presumed to have acted prudently related to a wildfire ignition unless a party in the cost recovery proceeding creates serious doubt as to the reasonableness of the utility's conduct, at which time, the burden shifts back to the utility to prove its conduct was prudent. Each of the Post-2018 Wildfires was ignited after July 12, 2019, and SCE has held a valid safety certificate since July 15, 2019. While a California investor-owned utility has not yet sought recovery for uninsured claims and other costs related to wildfires ignited after the adoption of AB 1054 , SCE believes that for fires ignited after July 12, 2019, and investor-owned utilities holding a safety certificate at the time of the fire, the CPUC will apply a standard of review similar to that applied by the FERC which presumes all costs requested by an investor-owned utility are reasonable and prudent unless serious doubt as to the reasonableness of the utility's conduct is raised. As such, SCE has concluded , at this time, that both uninsured CPUC-jurisdictional and uninsured FERC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs related to those Post-2018 Wildfires that it has deferred as regulatory assets are probable of recovery through electric rates. SCE will continue to evaluate the probability of recovery based on available evidence, including regulatory decisions, including any CPUC decisions illustrating the interpretation and/or application of the prudency standard under AB 1054, and, for each applicable fire, evidence that could cast serious doubt as to the reasonableness of SCE's conduct relative to that fire. Wildfire Insurance Coverage In May 2023, the CPUC allowed SCE to establish an expanded self-insurance program for wildfire-related costs that will be funded through CPUC-jurisdictional rates, with million collected for the second half of 2023 and, in the absence of wildfire-related claims, million collected for 2024. In July 2024, the CPUC issued a decision in the 2025 GRC proceeding authorizing this self-insurance framework to continue through at least 2028, supporting a self-insurance fund of up to billion per policy year. Through 2028, million will be collected annually until a total available self-insurance accrual amount of billion is achieved. If losses are accrued for wildfire-related claims for wildfires that occur between July 1, 2023 and the end of 2028, customer rates will be increased in subsequent years, as needed, to allow for full recovery of the amounts accrued up to billion per policy year, subject to a shareholder contribution of of any self-insurance costs ultimately paid exceeding million in any policy year, up to a maximum annual contribution of million per policy year. SCE's self-insurance program meets its obligation to maintain reasonable insurance coverage under AB 1054 for the January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024 period. SCE has approximately billion of wildfire-specific insurance coverage for events that occurred during the period July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023, subject to up to million of self-insured retention and co-insurance per fire, which results in

 million. Of this coverage, approximately million is provided by EIS and approximately million is provided by other commercial insurance carriers (commercial insurance carriers other than EIS are referred to herein as "Third-Party Commercial Insurers"). SCE's wildfire insurance expense for the July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023 policy period was approximately million, of which million was paid to Third-Party Commercial Insurers. The difference between the Third-Party Commercial Insurer cost and total cost for the July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023 policy period was paid in premiums to EIS. Wildfire insurance premiums paid for the July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023 policy period are being recovered through customer rates. See Note 17 for further information. Edison International and SCE record a receivable for insurance recoveries when recovery of a recorded loss is determined to be probable. Environmental Remediation SCE records its environmental remediation and restoration liabilities when site assessments and/or remedial actions are probable and a range of reasonably likely cleanup costs can be estimated. SCE reviews its sites and measures the liability quarterly, by assessing a range of reasonably likely costs for each identified site using currently available information, including existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, experience gained at similar sites, and the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties. These estimates include costs for site investigations, remediation, operation and maintenance, monitoring, and site closure. Unless there is a single probable amount, SCE records the lower end of this reasonably likely range of costs (reflected in "Other long-term liabilities") at undiscounted amounts as timing of cash flows is uncertain. At September 30, 2024, SCE's recorded estimated minimum liability to remediate its identified material sites (sites with a liability balance at September 30, 2024, in which the upper end of the range of expected costs is at least million) was million, including million related to San Onofre. In addition to these sites, SCE also has immaterial sites with a liability balance as of September 30, 2024, for which the total minimum recorded liability was million. Of the million total environmental remediation liability for SCE, million has been recorded as a regulatory asset. SCE expects to recover million through an incentive mechanism that allows SCE to recover of its environmental remediation costs at certain sites (SCE may request to include additional sites in this mechanism) and million through proceedings that allow SCE to recover up to of the costs incurred at certain sites through customer rates. SCE's identified sites include several sites for which there is a lack of currently available information, including the nature and magnitude of contamination, and the extent, if any, that SCE may be held responsible for contributing to any costs incurred for remediating these sites. Thus, no reasonable estimate of cleanup costs can be made for these sites. The ultimate costs to clean up SCE's identified sites may vary from its recorded liability due to numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, such as: the extent and nature of contamination; the scarcity of reliable data for identified sites; the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods; developments resulting from investigatory studies; the possibility of identifying additional sites; and the time periods over which site remediation is expected to occur. SCE believes that, due to these uncertainties, it is reasonably possible that cleanup costs at the identified material sites and immaterial sites could exceed its recorded liability by up to million and million, respectively. The upper limit of this range of costs was estimated using assumptions least favorable to SCE among a range of reasonably possible outcomes. SCE expects to clean up and mitigate its identified sites over a period of up to . Remediation costs for each of the next five years are expected to range from million to million. Costs incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were both million, and were included in the "Operation and maintenance" expense on Edison International's and SCE's consolidated statements of income. Based upon the CPUC's regulatory treatment of environmental remediation costs incurred at SCE, SCE believes that costs ultimately recorded will not materially affect its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. There can be no

 million and billion, respectively. If NEIL losses at any nuclear facility covered by the arrangement were to exceed the accumulated funds for these insurance programs, SCE could be assessed retrospective premium adjustments of up to approximately million per year. Federal law limits public offsite liability claims for bodily injury and property damage from a nuclear incident to the amount of available financial protection, which is currently approximately million for San Onofre and billion for Palo Verde. SCE and other owners of San Onofre and Palo Verde have purchased the maximum private primary insurance available through a Facility Form issued by American Nuclear Insurers. SCE withdrew from participation in the secondary insurance pool for San Onofre for offsite liability insurance effective January 5, 2018. Based on its ownership interests in Palo Verde, SCE could be required to pay a maximum of approximately million per nuclear incident for future incidents. However, it would have to pay no more than approximately million per future incident in any one year.

Based on that evaluation, Edison International's and SCE's respective Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officers have each concluded that, as of the end of the period, Edison International's and SCE's disclosure controls and procedures, respectively, were effective. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in Edison International's or SCE's internal control over financial reporting, respectively, during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Edison International's or SCE's internal control over financial reporting.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events Multiple lawsuits related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events naming SCE as a defendant have been filed by three categories of plaintiffs: individual plaintiffs, subrogation plaintiffs and public entity plaintiffs. A number of the lawsuits also name Edison International as a defendant and some of the lawsuits were filed as purported class actions. As of October 22, 2024, in addition to the outstanding claims of approximately 440 of the approximately 15,000 initial individual plaintiffs, there were alleged and potential claims of certain public entity plaintiffs, including CAL OES, outstanding. The litigation could take a number of years to be completely resolved because of the complexity of the matters and number of plaintiffs. As of October 22, 2024, SCE was aware of approximately 30 pending unsettled lawsuits representing approximately 80 individual plaintiffs related to the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires naming SCE as a defendant. Approximately 15 of the approximately 30 lawsuits also name Edison International as a defendant based on its ownership and alleged control of SCE. One of the lawsuits was filed as a purported class action. The lawsuits, which have been filed in the superior courts of Ventura, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles Counties allege, among other things, negligence, inverse condemnation, trespass, private nuisance, and violations of the public utilities and health and safety codes. SCE and certain of the individual plaintiffs in the Thomas and Koenigstein Fire litigation have been pursuing settlements of claims under a mediation program adopted to promote an efficient and orderly settlement process. As of October 22, 2024, one damages only trial has been set for May 2025 for individual plaintiffs in the TKM litigation. Approximately 10 of the approximately 30 pending unsettled individual plaintiff lawsuits mentioned in the paragraph above allege that SCE has responsibility for the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires and that the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires proximately caused the Montecito Mudslides, resulting in the plaintiffs' claimed damages. Many of the Montecito Mudslides lawsuits also name Edison International as a defendant based on its ownership and alleged control of SCE. In addition to other causes of action, some of the Montecito Mudslides lawsuits also allege personal injury and wrongful death. As of October 22, 2024, SCE was aware of approximately 100 currently pending unsettled lawsuits representing approximately 360 individual plaintiffs related to the Woolsey Fire naming SCE as a defendant. Approximately 80 of the 100

UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Share Repurchase Program On July 25, 2024, Edison International announced a stock repurchase program effective July 29, 2024 for repurchase of up to 200 million of its common stock until December 31, 2025 ("Repurchase Program"). The Repurchase Program will be used to offset dilution from common stock issued under Edison International's long-term incentive compensation programs and will be funded using Edison International's working capital. The timing and the amount of any repurchased common stock will be determined by Edison International's management based on their evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Repurchase Program may be executed through various methods, including open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. Any repurchased shares of common stock will be retired. The Repurchase Program does not obligate Edison International to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time in its discretion.

Unforeseeable Emergency means a severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant, the Participant s Beneficiary, or the Participant s spouse or dependent (as defined in Code Section 152, without regard to Sections 152(b)(1), (b)(2) and (d)(1)(B)); loss of the Participant s property due to casualty (including the need to rebuild a home following damage to a home not otherwise covered by insurance, for example, as a result of a natural disaster); or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the Participant s control. Valuation Date means the date as of which the Participant s benefit will be calculated, and is the first day of the month following the month in which the final day of employment falls 
 7 

prior to Separation from Service (or if the Participant first commenced participation in the Plan prior to 2021, the earlier of the Participant s Separation from Service or Disability), except that if the Participant s Separation from Service is a Termination of Employment, the Valuation Date is the later of (1) the first day of the month of the Participant s 55th birthday or (2) the first day of the month following the month in which the Participant s final day of employment occurs prior to Termination of Employment. Year of Service means a year of service as determined in accordance with the terms of the Qualified Plan (in the case of a Participant who does not actually participate in the Qualified Plan, determined in accordance with the terms of the Qualified Plan as though the Participant was a participant in the Qualified Plan). For Participants grandfathered in the defined-benefit final average pay benefit feature of the Qualified Plan (other than any such grandfathered Participants who were hired by an Affiliate or its subsidiaries in 1999 from Commonwealth Edison Company), years of service will be determined according to the same rules applicable to such benefit. For all other Participants, years of service will be determined according to the rules applicable to the cash- balance feature of the Qualified Plan. A Participant s prior service with Commonwealth Edison Company will be recognized for purposes of this Plan if the individual was a Participant on or before April 1, 2012 and was hired by an Affiliate (or its subsidiaries) in 1999 from Commonwealth Edison Company in connection with an acquisition transaction involving Edison Mission Energy. A Participant s prior service with Citizens Power LLC will be recognized for purposes of this Plan if the individual was a Participant on or before April 1, 2012 and was hired by an Affiliate (or its subsidiaries) in 2000 in connection with the acquisition of Citizens Power LLC by Edison Mission Energy. ARTICLE 2 PARTICIPATION 
 
 Individuals are eligible to participate in the Plan when they become Officers or are designated as Executives by the Affiliate s board or the Affiliate s CEO for purposes of this Plan. Participation in the Plan will continue as long as the individual remains an Officer or a designated Executive (subject to any applicable Plan restrictions) or has a vested benefit under the Plan that has not been completely paid out. ARTICLE 3 BENEFIT DETERMINATION AND VESTING 
 3.1 Overview (a) Benefits under the Plan will be payable with respect to any vested Participant following Retirement or the occurrence of a Contingent Event to the extent a benefit under the Plan is determined to exist by calculations as provided under the applicable provisions of this Article 3. Effective January 1, 2018, an ERA Credits feature has been added to the Plan as provided in Section 3.4 below. Prior to such date, a Participant s benefit under the Plan will be determined as provided in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 hereof. From and after such date, a Participant s benefit under the Plan will be determined as provided below in this Section 3.1. In each case, the Participant s benefit will be subject to vesting, as provided in Section 3.5, and to the provisions of Sections 3.6 and 3.7. 

 8 

(b) If a Participant was an Officer or a designated Executive at any time prior to January 1, 2018, the Participant s benefit under the Plan (subject to vesting as provided in Section 3.5) will be equal to the lesser of the amounts determined under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 3.1(b), determined based on lump sum values as of the applicable Valuation Date.
 (i) The Participant s total benefit as determined under Sections 3.2 and 3.3 below, taking into account the Participant s Total Compensation and Years of Service accrued at any time (whether before or after January 1, 2018). Such determination will be made without regard to Section 3.3(c) and will not include any ERA Credits under Section 3.4. 
 (ii) The Participant s total benefit determined as the sum of (x) the Participant s total benefit as determined under Sections 3.2 and 3.3 below (giving effect to Section 3.3(c) below), and (y) the amounts credited to the Participant s Executive Retirement Account.
 (c) If a Participant first becomes an Officer or a designated Executive on or after January 1, 2018, the Participant will be eligible only to receive ERA Credits (and earnings thereon) to the Participant s Executive Retirement Account as provided in Section 3.4 and will not be eligible for any benefits under Sections 3.2 and 3.3. 
 (d) Notwithstanding any Plan provisions to the contrary, if a Participant who has experienced a Separation from Service is rehired on or after January 1, 2018 and becomes an Officer or designated Executive, the Participant will be treated for additional benefit accrual purposes as if he or she was a new participant in the Plan: he or she will be eligible to receive additional ERA Credits (and earnings thereon) as provided in Section 3.4, but will not be eligible for any additional benefit accruals under Sections 3.2 and 3.3. 
 3.2 Benefit Features (a) The Plan provides a supplemental retirement benefit calculated in accordance with Section 3.3 below. This supplemental retirement benefit incorporates the following Benefit Features: 
 (i) Recognition of the amount of Salary that is not recognized for purposes of calculating benefits under the Qualified Plan or Profit Sharing contributions to the Savings Plan due to limits imposed by the Code under Sections 415(b) or 401(a)(17).
 (ii) Recognition of deferred Salary that is not recognized for purposes of calculating benefits under the Qualified Plan or Profit Sharing contributions to the Savings Plan.
 (iii) Recognition of Bonuses that are not recognized for purposes of calculating benefits under the Qualified Plan.
 
 (b) Participants who are Officers on the date of their termination of employment are eligible for all three Benefit Features. Other Participants are eligible for Benefit Features (i) and (ii) only; provided, however, as to a Participant who was once an Officer but who is not 

 9 

described in the immediately preceding sentence, such Participant shall be eligible for Benefit Features (i) and (ii) only, but his or her benefits shall not be less than if the Participant had terminated employment on December 11, 2012 and had Bonuses recognized for purposes of determining his or her benefits as of December 11, 2012. 
 (c) Participants in the Predecessor Plan on December 31, 1994 and Participants who were CEOs, Presidents, Executive Vice Presidents or Senior Vice Presidents of EIX or its Affiliates or elected Vice Presidents of EIX, Southern California Edison Company or Edison Capital prior to January 1, 2006, are also eligible for all three Benefit Features and an additional 0.75 benefit accrual for each Year of Service up to ten Years of Service (this additional 0.75 benefit accrual is taken into account when calculating the value of the single life annuity benefit for purposes of Section 3.3(b)), unless they were participants in the Predecessor Plan on December 31, 1992 and elected not to participate in the Executive Disability and Survivor Benefit Program, in which case they are eligible for all three Benefit Features but not for the additional 0.75 benefit accrual.
 (d) Notwithstanding the above, elected Vice Presidents of Edison Mission Energy, Edison Mission Marketing and Trading, and Midwest Generation whose Separation from Service occurred prior to January 1, 2006, are eligible for Benefit Features (i) and (ii) only.
 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.2, the three Benefit Features in this Section 3.2 and the additional 0.75 benefit accrual in Section 3.2(c) are subject to the provisions of Section 3.1.
 
 3.3 Benefit Computation (a) EIX will calculate at the time of a Participant s Disability (if the Participant first commenced participation in the Plan prior to 2021) or Separation from Service the amount of any benefit payable under the Plan. The benefit payable under this Section 3.3 will be the greater of (1) the value of the single life annuity calculated pursuant to Section 3.3(b), reduced by (i) the value of the single life annuity (unreduced for a contingent annuitant) payable to the Participant under the terms of the Qualified Plan, or other Affiliate defined benefit plan, after taking into account any applicable restrictions or limitations as to such payments required by the Code or other applicable law or the terms of the Qualified Plan, or other applicable Affiliate defined benefit plan; (ii) the actuarial single life annuity value, as defined in the Qualified Plan, of the Participant s Profit Sharing Account under the Savings Plan, or a successor plan; and (iii) the portion of the Participant s Social Security benefit specified in the Qualified Plan or (2) the actuarial single life annuity value of the notional account derived from any Executive Profit Sharing Credits allocated to the Participant plus earnings thereon. 
 (b) The Participant s Total Compensation and Years of Service will be used to calculate the value of the single life annuity benefit based on the Supplemental A formula set forth in Section 4.02(a) of the Qualified Plan, including Subsection (1) but excluding Subsection (2), and Section 4.12(b) of the Qualified Plan (provided, however, that individuals who become Participants after December 31, 2016 shall not be entitled to a benefit in this Plan based on the benefit formula in Section 4.12(b) of the Qualified Plan), and also, in the case of Disability or Death, Exhibit B of the Qualified Plan, or, in the case of Termination of Employment, Exhibit G 

 10 

of the Qualified Plan, notwithstanding the Participant s eligibility for such benefits under the terms of the Qualified Plan. 
 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining a Participant s benefit under clause (x) of Section 3.1(b)(ii), the Supplemental A formula set forth in Section 4.02(a) of the Qualified Plan used to determine the value of the Participant s single life annuity benefit as provided in Section 3.3(b) with respect to any Years of Service accrued after December 31, 2017 shall be modified as follows: one percent (1 shall replace one and three-quarters percent (1-3/4 as applied to the Participant s Total Compensation for each of the Participant s first thirty (30) Years of Service; and one-half of one percent (0.5 shall replace one percent (1 as applied to the Participant s Total Compensation for each of the Participant s Years of Service in excess of thirty (30). 
 (d) If a Participant who was an Executive prior to January 1, 2022 (for clarity, this Section 3.3(d) does not apply to any Participant who first became an Executive on or after January 1, 2022) experiences a Qualifying Severance, then an additional Year of Service credit (in the case of a Qualifying Termination Event associated with a Change in Control as defined in the Severance Plan, two years for Senior Vice Presidents and Executive Vice Presidents of EIX or Southern California Edison Company, but three years for the most senior officer of EIX, the most senior officer of Southern California Edison Company, the General Counsel of EIX, and the Chief Financial Officer of EIX) and an additional year of age (in the case of a Qualifying Termination Event associated with a Change in Control as defined in the Severance Plan, two years for Senior Vice Presidents and Executive Vice Presidents of EIX or Southern California Edison Company, but three years for the most senior officer of EIX, the most senior officer of Southern California Edison Company, the General Counsel of EIX, and the Chief Financial Officer of EIX) shall be included for purposes of the benefit calculation under Section 3.3(b), including in applying the benefit formula under the Qualified Plan for grandfathered employees who are not yet age 55 but who have 68 points. The value added by this severance enhancement shall be the difference between (i) the gross benefit calculated as described in Section 3.3(b) but with the additional age and service credits, before any reduction for benefits under other plans pursuant to Section 3.3(a), and (ii) the unenhanced gross benefit calculated under Section 3.3(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.3(d), if a Participant becomes entitled to benefits under the Severance Plan or any similar successor plan and is subsequently rehired as an Executive prior to the date lump sum payments or initial installment or annuity payments commence, the Participant shall not be entitled to any additional Year of Service or age credits under this Section 3.3. 
 (e) Participants who are also eligible for Profit Sharing may receive Executive Profit Sharing Credits. If any Profit Sharing contribution is reduced because a portion of the Participant s Salary is excluded either because of nonqualified Salary deferrals or the limits imposed by Sections 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Code, the amount by which the contribution was reduced will be credited to a notional Executive Profit Sharing Credit account under the Plan as of the date of the Profit Sharing contribution. Amounts in this notional account will earn notional interest at the rates in effect for cash balance interest credits in the Qualified Plan, credited daily and compounded annually. The resulting notional Executive Profit Sharing Credit amount will be taken into account in calculating the benefit described in Section 3.3(a). 

 11 

(f) The lump sum value of the benefit payable under Sections 3.3 as of the Valuation Date will be actuarially determined as the present value of the Participant s single life annuity benefit under Section 3.3 as of that date, using the discount rate and mortality table then in effect for lump sum determination in the Qualified Plan, except that the lump sum value may not be less than the value of the notional Executive Profit Sharing Credit account balance as of that date. 
 (g) A vested Participant who remains employed with an Affiliate until Retirement but is no longer an Officer or designated Executive will retain a Section 3.3 benefit based on the Participant s Total Compensation and service determined as of the last date of the Participant s eligible status and reduced by the amounts specified in Section 3.3(a) determined upon the Participant s Retirement.
 (h) As to a Participant whose Separation from Service (or if earlier, Disability) occurs after December 31, 2016, the following additional rules shall apply in calculating the amount of any benefit payable under the Plan with respect to the Participant s accrued but unused Sick Time Allowance Credits (as that term is used in the Qualified Plan):
 (i) In applying the benefit formula set forth in Section 4.12(b) of the Qualified Plan, the Participant s accrued but unused Sick Time Allowance Credits taken into account for purposes of this Section 3.3 shall be the lesser of (a) the Participant s accrued but unused Sick Time Allowance Credits as of December 31, 2016, or (b) the Participant s accrued but unused Sick Time Allowance Credits as of the Participant s Separation from Service (or if earlier, Disability).
 (ii) The form and timing of payment of the benefit attributable to such accrued but unused Sick Time Allowance Credits shall be deemed to be calculated under Section 4.12(b) of the Qualified Plan as in effect on January 1, 2015 (disregarding, for example, any change in the Qualified Plan that takes effect after that date to provide for such benefit to be paid in a single lump sum).
 
 (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.3, the benefits calculated pursuant to this Section 3.3 are subject to the provisions of Section 3.1.
 
 3.4 Executive Retirement Account Credits 
 This Section 3.4 shall be effective January 1, 2018. (a) ERA Credits for Non-Cash-Balance Participants . For each calendar year (commencing with 2018), ERA Salary Credits will be added by the Administrator to the Non-Cash-Balance Participant s Executive Retirement Account in an amount equal to the sum of (i) twelve percent (12 of the Non-Cash-Balance Participant s ERA Salary Base for the calendar year plus (ii) the product of such Participant s Profit Sharing Modifier Percentage multiplied by such Participant s 401(k) Earnings for that calendar year. Beginning with the 2018 Bonus (which is payable in 2019), ERA Bonus Credits will be added by the Administrator to the Non-Cash-Balance Participant s Executive Retirement Account in an amount equal to twelve percent (12 of the Non-Cash-Balance Participant s Bonus. ERA Credits will be credited (conditionally until vesting and subject to Section 3.4(c)) to the Executive Retirement Account 

 12 

effective as of the time the ERA Salary Base or Bonus to which the ERA Credits relate is actually paid. If a Non-Cash-Balance Participant has his or her employment transferred from an Affiliate to a non-participating affiliate of EIX, then ERA Bonus Credits will be added for the Non-Cash-Balance Participant s Bonus with respect to the Non-Cash-Balance Participant s employment by the Affiliate during the year in which the transfer occurred. As to a Non-Cash Balance Participant who is first employed by an Affiliate on or after January 1, 2021 and who commences participation in the Plan in the calendar year the individual is first employed by an Affiliate, ERA Salary Credits will be added by the Administrator to the Non-Cash-Balance Participant s Executive Retirement Account for the calendar year in which the Participant is first employed by an Affiliate, in an amount equal to the result of the following formula, but only if the result is a positive number: (i) six percent (6 of the Participant s 401(k) Earnings for that calendar year, minus (ii) the maximum matching contribution that could be made to the Participant under the Savings Plan for that calendar year assuming that the Participant maximized the Participant s Deferrals to the Savings Plan for that calendar year and taking into account, without limitation, (x) the limits under Section 402(g) of the Code and (y) the Participant s substantiated elective deferrals for that calendar year to any plan sponsored by an entity that is not a component member of EIX s controlled group of corporations within the meaning of Section 414(b) of the Code. Any ERA Credits pursuant to the preceding sentence will be credited (conditionally until vesting and subject to Section 3.4(c)) to the Participant s Executive Retirement Account effective as of the last day of the calendar year with respect to which such amounts are being credited. 
 ERA Credits for 2018 for Other Participants . For purposes of the 2018 calendar year for Participants who are not Non-Cash-Balance Participants, ERA Credits will be added by the Administrator to the Participant s Executive Retirement Account in an amount equal to twelve percent (12 of the Participant s ERA Salary Base for 2018. In addition, ERA Credits will be added by the Administrator to the Participant s Executive Retirement Account in an amount equal to twelve percent (12 of the Participant s 2018 Bonus (which is payable in 2019). ERA Credits will be credited (conditionally until vesting and subject to Section 3.4(c)) to the Executive Retirement Account effective as of the time the ERA Salary Base or Bonus to which the ERA Credits relate is actually paid. If a Participant has his or her employment transferred from an Affiliate to a non-participating affiliate of EIX, then ERA Bonus Credits will be added for the Participant s Bonus with respect to the Participant s employment by the Affiliate during the year in which the transfer occurred. ERA Credits for True-Up Participants . For True-Up Participants, the amount of ERA Salary Credits for a calendar year after 2018 will be the result of the following formula: twelve percent (12 of the Participant s Salary for the calendar year, minus the sum of (i) the Participant s Cash Balance Pay Credits for the calendar year and (ii) six percent (6 of the Participant s 401(k) Earnings for the calendar year. The amount of ERA Bonus Credits for a calendar (beginning with the 2019 Bonus payable in 2020) will equal twelve percent (12 of the Participant s Bonus for the calendar year, subject to the following reduction: if the equation for a Participant s ERA Salary Credits for a calendar year results in a negative number (the Adjustment ), then the Participant s ERA Salary Credits for that calendar year will be zero and the Adjustment will be applied to the Participant s ERA Bonus Credits for that calendar year, thereby reducing the ERA Bonus Credits; if the Adjustment would reduce the Participant s ERA Bonus Credits for that calendar year below zero, then the Participant s ERA Bonus Credits for 
 13 

that calendar year will be zero and the remainder of the Adjustment (i.e., the amount of the Adjustment remaining when ERA Bonus Credits are reduced to zero) will be disregarded. ERA Credits will be added by the Administrator to the True-Up Participant s Executive Retirement Account by April 30 of the following year. ERA Salary Credits for a calendar year will be credited (conditionally until vesting and subject to Section 3.4(c)) to the True-Up Participant s Executive Retirement Account effective as of December 31 of the calendar year; provided, however, for a calendar year in which a True-Up Participant experiences a Separation from Service or Disability, the True-Up Participant s ERA Salary Credits for that calendar year will be added to his or her Executive Retirement Account within 60 days of, and will be credited effective as of, the Separation from Service or Disability. ERA Bonus Credits for a calendar year will be credited (conditionally until vesting and subject to Section 3.4(c)) to the True-Up Participant s Executive Retirement Account effective as of the date the Bonus to which the ERA Credits relate is actually paid. If a Participant has his or her employment transferred from an Affiliate to a non-participating affiliate of EIX, then ERA Credits will be added to the Participant s Executive Retirement Account with respect to Salary and Bonus attributable to the Participant s employment by the Affiliate during the year in which the transfer occurred. (b) ERA Interest Credits for Non-Cash-Balance Participants . The Administrator will credit interest at the Crediting Rate (conditionally until vesting and subject to Section 3.4(c)) to a Non-Cash-Balance Participant s Executive Retirement Account on a daily basis, compounded annually, until the Valuation Date. No interest will be credited on ERA Credits for any date on or before the date when the ERA Salary Base or Bonus to which the ERA Credit relates is actually paid (for example, if a Participant s 2018 Bonus is paid on February 28, 2019, the related ERA Credits will be credited as of that date and interest will begin being credited on those ERA Credits on a go-forward basis as of March 1, 2019). After the Valuation Date, interest will be credited in accordance with Section 3.7. 
 
 ERA Interest Credits for 2018 Salary and Bonus for Other Participants . With respect to ERA Credits for Salary and Bonus for 2018 for a Participant who is not a Non-Cash Balance Participant, the Administrator will credit interest at the Crediting Rate (conditionally until vesting and subject to Section 3.4(c)) to the Participant s Executive Retirement Account on a daily basis, compounded annually, commencing on the date described in the next sentence and continuing until the Valuation Date. Interest will be credited commencing the day following the date when the ERA Salary Base or Bonus to which the ERA Credit relates is actually paid (for example, if a Participant s 2018 Bonus is paid on February 28, 2019, the related ERA Credits will be credited as of that date and interest will begin being credited on those ERA Credits on a go-forward basis as of March 1, 2019). After the Valuation Date, interest will be credited in accordance with Section 3.7. ERA Interest Credits for True-Up Participants . With respect to ERA Credits for Salary and Bonus for 2019 and subsequent years for True-Up Participants, the Administrator will credit interest (conditionally until vesting and subject to Section 3.4(c)) in the manner described in this paragraph. With respect to ERA Salary Credits for a Plan Year, the Administrator will credit interest as follows: the ERA Salary Credits for the Plan Year (after the Adjustment, if any) will be multiplied by the annual Crediting Rate (converted into a decimal format) and the result will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the Plan Year during which the True-Up Participant served at least one day as an Executive, and the 
 14 

denominator of which is twenty-four (24); the resulting simplified interest will be credited on the Simplified Interest Crediting Date, which shall be December 31 of the Plan Year or, if earlier, the last day of the month in which the Participant s Separation from Service or Disability occurs; commencing the day after the Simplified Interest Crediting Date, interest will be credited at the Crediting Rate on a daily basis, compounded annually, until the Valuation Date. With respect to ERA Bonus Credits for a Plan Year, no interest will be credited for the date as of which the ERA Bonus Credits (after the Adjustment, if any) are credited, but commencing as of the following day, the Administrator will credit interest at the Crediting Rate on a daily basis, compounded annually, until the Valuation Date. After the Valuation Date, all interest will be credited in accordance with Section 3.7. Prospective Changes . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.4(b), the Administrator, or its delegate, may prospectively change the methodology for calculating ERA Interest Credits. (c) In the event a Participant is entitled to the benefit specified in Section 3.1(b)(i), the Participant s Executive Retirement Account shall be disregarded and automatically cancelled.
 (d) In the event a Participant is entitled to the benefit specified in Section 3.1(b)(ii) or Section 3.1(c), the benefit attributable to the Participant s Executive Retirement Account shall be subject to the payment election provisions of Article 4 and, if the Participant s benefit is determined under Section 3.1(b)(ii), the Participant s Executive Retirement Account shall be paid on the same schedule as the Participant s benefit determined under Sections 3.2 and 3.3.
 (e) If a Participant who was an Executive prior to January 1, 2022 (for clarity, this Section 3.4(e) does not apply to any Participant who first became an Executive on or after January 1, 2022) experiences a Qualifying Severance, then ERA Credits will be added by the Administrator to the Participant s Executive Retirement Account in an amount equal to twelve percent (12 times the sum of (i) the Participant s ERA Salary Base Differential plus (ii) the Participant s Target Bonus Amount. In the case of a Qualifying Termination Event associated with a Change in Control as defined in the Severance Plan, twelve percent (12 in the preceding sentence will be replaced by: twenty-four percent (24 if the Participant is a Senior Vice President or Executive Vice President of EIX or Southern California Edison Company; thirty-six percent (36 if the Participant is the most senior officer of EIX, the most senior officer of Southern California Edison Company, the General Counsel of EIX, or the Chief Financial Officer of EIX. Such ERA credits will be credited effective as of the date of the Separation from Service. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.4(e), if a Participant becomes entitled to benefits under the Severance Plan or any similar successor plan and is subsequently rehired as an Executive prior to the date lump sum payments or initial installment or annuity payments commence, any additional ERA credits under this Section 3.4(e) shall be disregarded and automatically cancelled. 
 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.4, the Administrator, or its delegate, may prescribe rules in the form or instructions for any Payment Election for a Plan Year that are different than the rules set forth in this Section 3.4 for purposes of determining Executive Retirement Account credits for the Plan Year . For clarity, no ERA Credits will be 

 15 

credited with respect to a Participant for any Plan Year prior to the Plan Year in which the individual is first a Participant. 
 3.5 Vesting 
 Subject to the provisions of Section 3.4, the right to receive benefits under the Plan (including any amounts credited to a Participant s Executive Retirement Account, if a Participant is entitled to such amounts under Section 3.1) will vest (i) when the Participant has completed five Years of Service with an Affiliate, (ii) upon the Participant s Disability while employed with an Affiliate, (iii) upon the Participant s death while employed with an Affiliate, or (iv) upon the Participant s Separation from Service if the Participant experiences a Qualifying Severance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, credits and benefits under the Plan (together with any earnings or interest credited thereon pursuant to the Plan) shall be subject to recoupment and/or forfeiture to the extent that they are calculated or based upon a Bonus or other incentive-based compensation that is subject to forfeiture and/or recoupment in accordance with applicable law, pursuant to any recoupment, clawback or similar policy maintained by EIX or its Affiliates, or pursuant to the terms of the Bonus award or incentive-based compensation award to which the credits or benefits relate. 3.6 Adjustment for Final Bonus If the final Bonus is determined after benefits under the Plan are paid or commenced, the benefit will be recalculated from inception (as a point of clarity, ERA Credits for the final Bonus will be credited, in accordance with and subject to Section 3.4, as of the date the Bonus is actually paid, but for purposes of Section 3.1(b) the value of those ERA Credits will be calculated as of the Valuation Date using the discount rate in effect for lump sum determination in the Qualified Plan as of the Valuation Date) and a one-time adjustment will be made to true-up payments already made, and future payments, if any, will be adjusted accordingly. Any true-up payment will be made within two and one-half months of the date the final Bonus is determined. 3.7 Valuation Date Notional Account A notional account will be established as the Plan benefit as of the Valuation Date, with an initial value equal to the lump sum value calculated pursuant Article 3. The account will be credited with interest at the Crediting Rate on a daily basis, compounded annually, until the account has been fully paid out (or annuity payments commence, as the case may be) according to the terms of the Plan and the Participant s Payment Election. 
 16 

ARTICLE 4 PAYMENT ELECTIONS 1 
 4.1 Primary Payment Election for Plan Years Prior to 2019 (except as otherwise provided) (a) Each year (through December 31, 2017), a Participant may make a Primary Payment Election specifying the payment schedule for the benefits to be accrued in the following Plan Year (concluding with the 2018 Plan Year) by submitting an election to the Administrator in such time and manner established by the Administrator. By way of example, benefits attributable to Bonus compensation will be treated as accrued during the Plan Year when the relevant services are performed (and not any later year when the Bonus is actually paid), and any benefits attributable to additional Year of Service or age credits triggered by a Participant s Separation from Service under the Severance Plan will be treated as accrued during the Plan Year when the Participant s Separation from Service occurs. 
 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a Primary Payment Election made for one Plan Year shall apply for subsequent Plan Years unless prior to a subsequent Plan Year the Participant submits a new Primary Payment Election for the subsequent Plan Year. If (i) a Primary Payment Election in effect with respect to one Plan Year (the first Plan Year) carries over and applies to the next Plan Year (the second Plan Year) pursuant to the preceding sentence, and (ii) the Participant s Primary Payment Election in effect with respect to the first Plan Year is that payments shall commence upon the later of the Participant s Retirement or the first day of a specific month and year, then the same Primary Payment Election (including the same specified date) will apply to the second Plan Year; provided that if the specified date payout election in effect with respect to the first Plan Year is a date in the first or second Plan Year, the Participant shall be deemed to have made a Primary Payment Election for the second Plan Year that the benefits accrued in the second Plan Year shall commence payment upon the Participant s Retirement. 
 (c) On or before December 31, 2008, Participants may make a special Primary Payment Election in accordance with the transition rule under Section 409A of the Code for Plan benefits previously scheduled to commence payment after the calendar year in which the special Primary Payment Election is made.
 
 (d) The choices available for a Primary Payment Election are as provided in the applicable Primary Payment Election form, but may include the following: (i) Joint and survivor life annuity paid in monthly installments; or (ii) Contingent life annuity paid in monthly installments; or (iii) Monthly installments for 60 to 180 months; or 
 1 For purposes of clarity, the provisions of this Plan regarding Payment Elections for the 2021 Plan Year are effective beginning with Payment Elections made in 2020 for the 2021 Plan Year. 
 17 

(iv) A single lump sum; or (v) Two to fifteen installments paid annually; or (vi) Any combination of the choices listed in (iii), (iv) and (v). Payments under a Primary Payment Election may commence upon (i) the Participant s Retirement, (ii) the later of the Participant s Retirement or the first day of a specific month and year, or (iii) the first day of the month that is a specified number of months and/or years following the Participant s Retirement or the first day of a specified month a specified number of years following the calendar year in which the Participant s Retirement occurs (provided that if the date otherwise determined pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) is later than the later of the Participant s Retirement or the month and year in which the Participant attains age 75, the date pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) shall be the later of the Participant s Retirement or the month and year in which the Participant attains age 75). If the Participant elects under a Primary Payment Election to receive payment pursuant to clause (ii) and the Participant dies prior to the later of Retirement or the specified payment date, payment shall be made pursuant to the Participant s Contingent Payment Election (if any) for the Participant s death (regardless of whether the Participant s death occurs while the Participant is employed by an Affiliate or thereafter). (e) If no Primary Payment Election has been made, the Primary Payment Election shall be deemed to be a joint and survivor annuity paid in monthly installments commencing upon the Participant s Retirement (or, if earlier, the Participant s death or Disability); provided, however, that if a Participant first becomes an Officer or a designated Executive on or after January 1, 2018, the Primary Payment Election shall be deemed (if no Primary Payment Election has been made) to be a lump sum payable upon Retirement (or, if earlier, the Participant s death or Disability). (f) Subject to Section 4.5, lump sum payments or initial installment or annuity payments will be made within 90 days (60 days in the case of a payment triggered by a specified payment date) of the scheduled dates, and interest will be added at the Crediting Rate to the payment amount for the days elapsed between the scheduled payment date and the actual date of payment. If the Participant s delivery of a release would change the amount of his or her Plan benefit, and the period for the Participant to consider, execute, and revoke such release spans two different calendar years, and the 90- or 60-day period, as applicable, specified above for the payment of any benefit contingent on such release also spans those two years, payment of the portion of the benefit contingent upon such release (and earnings thereon) shall be made in the time period otherwise specified above but in the second of those two years. If paid in installments, the installments will be paid as follows: (i) For purposes of calculating installments, the account will be valued as of the Valuation Date and subsequently as of December 31 each year, with installments for the next calendar year adjusted according to procedures established by the Administrator. (ii) For individuals who first commenced participation in the Plan prior to 2021, the installments will be paid in amounts that will amortize the balance with 
 18 

interest credited at the Crediting Rate on a daily basis, compounded annually, over the period of time benefits are to be paid. (iii) For individuals who first commenced participation in the Plan after 2020, annual installment amounts shall be determined by dividing (a) by (b), where (a) equals the account value as of the last valuation under clause (i) above and (b) equals the remaining number of installment payments. The balance will continue to be credited with interest at the Crediting Rate until the last installment payment is made. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, distribution in installments shall be treated as a single payment as of the date of the initial installment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. If paid in monthly installments, the installments may be paid in a single check or in more than one check for any given month, provided that in either such case the total amount of the monthly payment shall not change. If the applicable Payment Election or deemed Payment Election is for payment in the form of an annuity, the annuity value of the Plan benefit will be calculated in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Qualified Plan except that this Plan will govern where its provisions under Section 3.3 (which shall also apply to Section 3.4(d) for purposes of calculating the applicable annuity value of any benefit derived from an Executive Retirement Account) are inconsistent with those of the Qualified Plan. 4.1.1 Payment Election for 2019 and Later Plan Years (a) If a Participant first commenced participation in the Plan prior to 2021, the Participant may elect, as part of a Payment Election for each Plan Year from 2019 through 2021, and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 4.1.1, that payments commence upon: (i) the Participant s Payment Event; (ii) the later of the Participant s Payment Event or January 1 of a specified year that may be no later than the year in which the Participant attains age 75; (iii) January 1 of the year following the Payment Event; or (iv) January 1 of the fifth year following the Payment Event. I f the date otherwise determined pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) above is later than the later of the Participant s Payment Event or the month and year in which the Participant attains age 75, the commencement date pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) shall be the later of the Participant s Payment Event or the month and year in which the Participant attains age 75. If the Payment Event is a Separation from Service prior to Retirement (other than due to death), the commencement date pursuant to clauses (i) through (iv) above shall be determined as if the Payment Event was the later of the Participant s Separation from Service or the first day of the month of the Participant s 55th birthday. If a Participant first commenced participation in the Plan after 2020, the Participant may elect, as part of a Payment Election that applies to all Plan benefits accrued by the Participant in the Plan Year of initial participation and all subsequent Plan Years, and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 4.1.1, that payments commence upon: (i) the later of January 1 of the year following the Participant s Payment Event or the first day of the seventh month following the Participant s Payment Event; or (ii) the later of the first day of the seventh month following the Participant s Payment Event or January 1 of a specified year; provided, however, that if the 
 19 

Payment Event is a Separation from Service prior to Retirement (other than due to death), the commencement date shall be determined as if the Payment Event was the later of the Participant s Separation from Service or the first day of the month of the Participant s 55th birthday. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in this Plan, a Participant s Payment Election for the 2021 Plan Year (or for the first Plan Year that the individual participates in the Plan, if the individual is not a Participant for the 2021 Plan Year) shall also apply to all benefits accrued by the Participant under the Plan in all subsequent Plan Years (the Single Payment Election for 2021 and Later Years ). Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, or its delegate, in the applicable Payment Election form or instructions, the choices available for a Payment Election are as follows: a single lump sum; five, ten or fifteen installments paid annually; a joint and survivor life annuity paid in monthly installments; or Contingent life annuity paid in monthly installments. Notwithstanding any provisions of the preceding paragraphs in this Section 4.1.1(a) to the contrary, benefits accrued with respect to the 2019 Plan Year or any subsequent Plan Year by an individual who first commenced participation in the Plan prior to 2021 shall (except as provided in the next paragraph) be subject to the following payment rules: (i) if a Participant dies or, while employed by an Affiliate, becomes Disabled before payments have commenced, then payments shall be made in a lump sum upon (or within 90 days following) the Participant s death or Disability; (ii) if a Participant dies or, while employed by an Affiliate, becomes Disabled after payments have commenced but before all payments have been completed, then all of the Participant s remaining benefits shall be made in a lump sum upon (or within 90 days following) the Participant s death or Disability; provided, however, that (iii) if a Participant who dies had elected either a joint and survivor annuity or a Contingent life annuity with a survivor benefit, then the survivor benefit shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the Participant s Payment Election. Notwithstanding any provisions of the preceding paragraphs in this Section 4.1.1(a) to the contrary, benefits accrued by an individual who first commenced participation in the Plan after 2020 shall (except as provided in the next paragraph) be subject to the following payment rules: (i) if a Participant dies before payments have commenced, then payments shall be made in a lump sum upon (or within 90 days following) the Participant s death; (ii) if a Participant dies after payments have commenced but before all payments have been completed, then all of the Participant s remaining benefits shall be made in a lump sum upon (or within 90 days following) the Participant s death; provided, however, that (iii) if a Participant who dies had elected either a joint and survivor annuity or a Contingent life annuity with a survivor benefit, then the survivor benefit shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the Participant s Payment Election. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Section 4.1.1 to the contrary, if a Participant who has a Primary Payment Election in effect with respect to the 2018 Plan Year (including a deemed election) does not make a new Payment Election for benefits accrued for the 2019 Plan Year, then Sections 4.1(b) and 4.2(b) (and not the preceding provisions of this Section 4.1.1) shall continue to apply to such Participant and the Primary Payment Election (including a deemed election) for the 2018 Plan Year and the Contingent Payment Election (including a deemed election) for the 2018 Plan Year (such Primary Payment Election and Contingent Payment 
 20 

Election, the 2018 Elections shall apply for the 2019 Plan Year and then for the 2020 Plan Year and then for the Single Payment Election for 2021 and Later Years, unless prior to such subsequent Plan Year (but no later than 2020 for the Single Payment Election for 2021 and Later Years) the Participant submits a new Payment Election pursuant to this Section 4.1.1 for the subsequent Plan Year. For clarity, as to any benefits accrued for a Plan Year as to which a Participant s 2018 Elections apply, such benefits shall be paid in accordance with Sections 4.1(b) and 4.2(b) and such 2018 Elections, and the preceding paragraphs of this Section 4.1.1 (including, without limitation, the death and Disability payment rules of the preceding paragraph) shall not apply. (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.1.1, a Payment Election made for one Plan Year shall apply for subsequent Plan Years unless prior to such subsequent Plan Year (but no later than 2020 for the Single Payment Election for 2021 and Later Years) the Participant submits a new Payment Election for the subsequent Plan Year. If a Payment Election in effect with respect to one Plan Year (the first Plan Year) carries over and applies to the next Plan Year (the second Plan Year) pursuant to this paragraph, and the Participant s Payment Election in effect with respect to the first Plan Year includes a specified date payout election pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 4.1.1(a), that date will apply to the second Plan Year; provided that if the specified date payout election in effect with respect to the first Plan Year is a date in the first or second Plan Year, the Participant shall be deemed to have made a Payment Election for the second Plan Year that the benefits accrued in the second Plan Year shall commence payment upon the Participant s Payment Event. (c) A Payment Election with respect to a Plan Year shall be made in such time and manner established by the Administrator, but in all events (except as provided in the next sentence) prior to the start of the Plan Year with respect to which the election is made. An individual who is first selected as a Participant in this Plan may make a Payment Election within thirty days (or such shorter period as may be prescribed by the Administrator) after the date the individual first becomes a Participant. In each case, if no Payment Election has been made by the Participant, the Participant s Payment Election shall be deemed to be a lump sum payable, for Participants who first commenced participation in the Plan prior to 2021, upon the earliest of the Participant s Payment Event, death, or Disability, and for Participants who first commenced participation in the Plan after 2020, upon the earlier of (i) death or (ii) the later of January 1 of the year following the Participant s Payment Event or the first day of the seventh month following the Participant s Payment Event; provided, however, that if the Payment Event is a Separation from Service prior to the first day of the month of the Participant s 55th birthday, the commencement date shall be the first day of the month of the Participant s 55th birthday. (d) The provisions in Section 4.1(f) also apply to this Section 4.1.1. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.1.1, the Administrator, or its delegate, may prescribe rules in the form or instructions for any Payment Election that are different than the rules set forth in this Section 4.1.1 as to the benefits covered by such Payment Election, including expanding or limiting the forms of payment and payment commencement dates available for the Payment Election and prescribing different payment rules for death and Disability. 
 21 

4.2 Contingent Payment Elections for Plan Years Prior to 2019 (except as otherwise provided) (a) Each year (through December 31, 2017), a Participant may make Contingent Payment Elections for each of the Contingent Events of (1) the Participant s death while employed by an Affiliate, (2) the Participant s Disability while employed by an Affiliate, and (3) Termination of Employment for the benefits to be accrued in the following Plan Year (concluding with the 2018 Plan Year), which election will take effect upon the first Contingent Event that occurs before the Participant s Retirement, by submitting an election to the Administrator in such time and manner established by the Administrator. 
 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a Contingent Payment Election made for one Plan Year shall apply for subsequent Plan Years unless prior to a subsequent Plan Year the Participant submits a new Contingent Payment Election for the subsequent Plan Year. If (i) a Contingent Payment Election in effect with respect to one Plan Year (the first Plan Year) carries over and applies to the next Plan Year (the second Plan Year) pursuant to the preceding sentence, and (ii) the Participant s Contingent Payment Election in effect with respect to the first Plan Year is that payments shall commence upon the later of the Participant s Contingent Event or the first day of a specific month and year, then the same Contingent Payment Election (including the same specified date) will apply to the second Plan Year; provided that if the specified date payout election in effect with respect to the first Plan Year is a date in the first or second Plan Year, the Participant shall be deemed to have made a Contingent Payment Election for the Second Plan Year that the benefits accrued in the second Plan Year shall commence payment upon the Participant s Contingent Event.
 (c) The choices available for the Contingent Payment Elections are those specified in Section 4.1 except that the references to Retirement shall instead be the applicable Contingent Event if the event is death or Disability or the first day of the month of the Participant s 55th birthday (or, if later, Termination of Employment) if the Contingent Event is Termination of Employment. 
 
 If the Participant has made no Contingent Payment Election and a Contingent Event occurs prior to Retirement, the Administrator will pay the benefit as specified in the Participant s Primary Payment Election, except that payments scheduled for payment or commencement of payment upon Retirement, or with a payment date determined by reference to Retirement, will be paid, commence or have payment determined by reference to the first day of the month following the date of the Contingent Event if the Contingent Event is the Participant s death or Disability, but will be the first day of the month of the Participant s 55th birthday (or, if later, Termination of Employment) if the Contingent Event is Termination of Employment. If a Contingent Event occurs prior to Retirement and the Participant has made neither a Primary Payment Election nor a Contingent Payment Election, the Payment Election shall be deemed to be a joint and survivor life annuity payable on the first day of the month following the date of the Contingent Event if the Contingent Event is the Participant s death or Disability, but payable on the first day of the month of the Participant s 55th birthday (or, if later, the first day of the month following the month in which the Participant s final day of employment occurs prior to Termination of Employment) if the Contingent Event is Termination of Employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant first becomes an Officer or a designated 
 22 

Executive in 2018, the Contingent Payment Election shall be deemed to be a lump sum payable upon on the first day of the month following the date of the Contingent Event if the Contingent Event is the Participant s death or Disability, but payable on the first day of the month of the Participant s 55th birthday (or, if later, Termination of Employment) if the Contingent Event is Termination of Employment. 4.3 Changes to Payment Elections 
 Participants may change an existing Payment Election, including a deemed Payment Election, by submitting a new written Payment Election to the Administrator, subject to the following conditions: (1) the new Payment Election shall not be effective unless made at least twelve months before the payment or commencement date scheduled under the prior Payment Election, (2) the new Payment Election must defer a lump sum payment or commencement of installment or life annuity payments for a period of at least five years from the date that the lump sum would have been paid or installment or life annuity payments would have commenced under the prior Payment Election, and (3) the election shall not be effective until twelve months after it is filed with the Administrator. For Payment Election changes submitted before 2021, a Payment Election change will not be effective if at the time such new Payment Election is made, the imposition of the five-year delay would require that the benefits to be paid pursuant to such Payment Election would not begin until Participant s 75 th birthday. Except as otherwise provided by the Administrator, or its delegate, in the form or instructions for a Payment Election change submitted after 2020, any such Payment Election change as to a Payment Event or (in the case of a change to a Contingent Payment Election) death (or, in either case, a date determined with reference to a Payment Event or death) will not be effective unless the new Payment Election defers the applicable payment start date by exactly five years from the start date under the prior Payment Election (for clarity, to the extent a Payment Election provides for payment to commence upon a specified date, rather than a date determined with reference to a Payment Event or death, the new Payment Election may defer the specified date by five or more years). After 2018, the payment schedules available under a new Payment Election are those prescribed by the Administrator, or its delegate, in the form or instructions for the Payment Election change , subject to the conditions specified in this paragraph. After 2018, a Participant will only be given one opportunity to change a Payment Election for benefit accruals with respect to each of the following (i) each Plan Year prior to 2021 and (ii) the Single Payment Election for 2021 and Later Years. Participants who have elected a form of life annuity as their Primary Payment Election or Contingent Payment Election (including any deemed Payment Election) may change such election from one form of life annuity to another form of life annuity otherwise permitted by the Plan (to the extent applicable) by submitting a new written Payment Election to the Administrator, subject to the following conditions: (1) the new Payment Election shall not be effective unless made before the payment or commencement date scheduled under the prior Payment Election, (2) the payment or commencement date under the prior Payment Election is not changed (or the change is made pursuant to the provisions of the preceding paragraph), and (3) the annuities are actuarially equivalent (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(ii). 
 23 

4.4 Small Benefit Exception 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion and as determined by it in writing, pay the benefits in a single lump sum if the sum of all benefits payable to the Participant under this Plan and all Similar Plans is less than or equal to the applicable dollar amount under Section 402(g)(1)(B) of the Code. 4.5 Six-Month Delay in Payment for Specified Employees 
 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that a Participant who is a Specified Employee is entitled to a distribution from the Plan due to the Participant s Separation from Service, the lump sum payment or the commencement of installment or life annuity payments, as the case may be, may not be scheduled to occur or occur before the date that is the earlier of (1) six months following the Participant s Separation from Service for reasons other than death or (2) the Participant s death. 4.6 Conflict of Interest Exception, Etc. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, pay benefits in a single lump sum if permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(iii). In addition, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, accelerate benefits, and pay such benefits in a single lump sum, if and to the extent permitted under any of the other exceptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4) to the general rule in Section 409A of the Code prohibiting accelerated payments, provided that the terms of Section 4.4 of the Plan shall govern whether benefits will be paid in a single lump sum pursuant to the small benefit exception contained in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(v). ARTICLE 5 SURVIVOR BENEFITS 
 5.1 Payment 
 Following the Participant s death, payment of the Participant s benefit will be made to the Participant s Beneficiary or Beneficiaries according to the payment schedule elected or deemed elected according to Article 4, subject to the payment provisions (if applicable) of Section 4.1.1. 5.2 Benefit Computation 
 In addition, if the applicable Payment Election or deemed Payment Election is for a joint and survivor life annuity, the survivor benefit is 50 of the Participant s annuity amount, payable only to the spouse married to the Participant at the earlier of the commencement of Plan benefit payments to the Participant or the Participant s death, but actuarially reduced if that spouse is more than five years younger than the Participant. If the election is for a contingent life annuity, the survivor benefit will be as elected. The survivor benefit associated with a life annuity will be calculated in a manner consistent with the survivor benefit provisions of the Qualified Plan except that this Plan will govern where its provisions under Sections 3.3 and 3.4(d) are inconsistent with those of the Qualified Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding 
 24 

provisions of this Section 5.2, if the Payment Election or deemed Payment Election is for a joint and survivor annuity, or a contingent life annuity, and the Participant dies on or after December 8, 2021 and while employed by an Affiliate, the survivor benefit as to any distribution of Plan benefits triggered by such Separation from Service will equal 100 of the Participant s benefit (i.e., not reduced to 50 or 75 of the Participant s annuity amount), but such benefit shall still be actuarially reduced (as otherwise provided above) for the age of the spouse or contingent annuitant, as applicable. ARTICLE 6 BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION 
 
 The Participant will have the right, at any time, to designate any person or persons or entity as Beneficiary (both primary and contingent) to whom payment under the Plan will be made in the event of the Participant s death; provided that if the Participant has elected (or is deemed to have elected) a Payment Election in the form of a joint and survivor life annuity or a contingent life annuity and designates a new person or entity as Beneficiary after annuity payments have commenced, the annuity payments to such newly designated Beneficiary must be made in the same amounts and at the same times as payments would have been made to the designated Beneficiary immediately preceding the commencement of payments. The Beneficiary designation will be effective when it is submitted to the Administrator during the Participant s lifetime in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator. The submission of a new Beneficiary designation will cancel all prior Beneficiary designations. Any finalized divorce or marriage of a Participant subsequent to the date of a Beneficiary designation will revoke such designation, unless in the case of divorce the previous spouse was not designated as a Beneficiary, and unless in the case of marriage the Participant s new spouse has previously been designated as the sole primary Beneficiary. The spouse of a married Participant must consent in writing to any designation of a Beneficiary other than the spouse. If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if the Beneficiary designation is revoked by marriage, divorce, or otherwise without execution of a new designation, or if every person designated as Beneficiary predeceases the Participant, then the Administrator will direct the distribution of the benefits to the Participant s estate. If a primary Beneficiary dies after the Participant s death but prior to completion of the distribution of benefits under this Plan, and no contingent Beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, any remaining payments will be made to the primary Beneficiary s Beneficiary, if one has been designated, or to the Beneficiary s estate. ARTICLE 7 CONDITIONS RELATED TO BENEFITS 
 7.1 Nonassignability 
 The benefits provided under the Plan may not be alienated, assigned, transferred, pledged or hypothecated by or to any person or entity, at any time or any manner whatsoever. These benefits will be exempt from the claims of creditors of any Participant or other claimants and 
 25 

from all orders, decrees, levies, garnishment or executions against any Participant to the fullest extent allowed by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the benefit payable to a Participant may be assigned in full or in part, pursuant to a domestic relations order of a court of competent jurisdiction. 7.2 Unforeseeable Emergency 
 A Retired Participant, a Participant who has a Disability, or a Participant who is age 55 or older may submit a hardship distribution request to the Administrator in writing setting forth the reasons for the request. The Administrator will have the sole authority to approve or deny such requests. Upon a finding that the Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Administrator may in its discretion, permit the Participant to accelerate distributions of benefits under the Plan in the amount reasonably necessary to alleviate the Unforeseeable Emergency. 7.3 No Right to Assets 
 A Participant s benefits paid under the Plan will be paid from the general funds of the Participant s Employer, and the Participant and any Beneficiary will be no more than unsecured general creditors of that Employer with no special or prior right to any assets of the Employer for payment of any obligations hereunder. Neither the Participant nor the Beneficiary will have a claim to benefits from any other Affiliate. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the definition of Employer to the contrary, and at the sole discretion of EIX, EIX may determine that for purposes of benefits payable under the Plan, EIX shall be deemed to be the Employer obligated to pay such benefits. Such an election by EIX may be made, in EIX s sole discretion, as to all Plan benefits, as to only certain benefits, and/or as to only certain Affiliates or Participants, and will be deemed an assumption of the specified benefit obligations of the applicable Affiliates. Subject to the further provisions hereof, EIX will be solely obligated to pay any such benefits and no Participant (or Beneficiary) will have a claim as to any other Affiliate with respect to such benefits. Upon an election by EIX under this Section 7.3, benefits covered by the election will be paid from the general funds of EIX (and not the Affiliate that would otherwise pay the benefits), provided that EIX may require that as between EIX and the Affiliate that would otherwise pay such benefits, the Affiliate will be responsible to pay EIX for the assumption of such obligations in accordance with funding arrangements determined by EIX at the time of election or any time thereafter. To the extent such Affiliate fails to comply with such funding arrangements or obtains any refund or offset of payments made from the Affiliate to EIX without the consent of EIX, the Affiliate that would otherwise be responsible for payment of benefits to the applicable Participant will remain responsible for such benefits. EIX will effectuate any such election pursuant to this Section 7.3 by providing written notice to the Administrator and the applicable Affiliates regarding the effective date of such election, and the benefits, Affiliates and Participants for which the election is applicable. The funding arrangements established by EIX at the time of its election, or from time to time thereafter, will set forth the method by which the Affiliates will remit funds to EIX in consideration of Plan benefit obligations that are assumed by EIX. Such a method may include, but is not limited to, lump sum payment by an Affiliate to EIX of relevant benefits accrued through the date of EIX s election based on the Projected Benefit Obligation PBO with regular periodic payments to EIX of continuing accruals; regular periodic payments by an Affiliate to EIX of benefits accrued based on the PBO beginning with the date of EIX s election through the date such benefits 
 26 

become due under the Plan; lump sum payment by an Affiliate to EIX at the time benefits become due under the Plan; or intercompany payables and receivables used with funding on a pay-as-you-go basis. 7.4 Protective Provisions 
 The Participant will cooperate with the Administrator by furnishing any and all information requested by the Administrator, in order to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder, taking such physical examinations as the Administrator may deem necessary and signing such consents to insure or taking such other actions as may be requested by the Administrator. If the Participant refuses to cooperate, the Administrator and the Employer will have no further obligation to the Participant under the Plan. 7.5 Constructive Receipt 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, in the event the Administrator determines that amounts deferred under the Plan have failed to comply with Section 409A and must be recognized as income for federal income tax purposes, distribution of the amounts included in a Participant s income will be made to such Participant. The determination of the Administrator under this Section 7.5 will be binding and conclusive. 7.6 Withholding 
 The Participant or the Beneficiary will make appropriate arrangements with the Administrator for satisfaction of any federal, state or local income tax withholding requirements and Social Security or other employee tax requirements applicable to the accrual or payment of benefits under the Plan. If no other arrangements are made, the Administrator may provide, at its discretion, for such withholding and tax payments as may be required. 7.7 Incapacity 
 If any person entitled to payments under this Plan is incapacitated and unable to use such payments in his or her own best interest, EIX may direct that payments (or any portion) be made to that person s legal guardian or conservator, or that person s spouse, as an alternative to payment to the person unable to use the payments. EIX will have no obligation to supervise the use of such payments, and court-appointed guardianship or conservatorship may be required. ARTICLE 8 PLAN ADMINISTRATION 
 8.1 Plan Interpretation 
 The Administrator will administer the Plan and interpret, construe and apply its provisions in accordance with its terms and will provide direction and oversight as necessary to management, staff, or contractors to whom day-to-day Plan operations may be delegated. The Administrator will establish, adopt or revise such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. The Administrator will interpret and construe the Plan to comply with Section 409A of the Code. All decisions of the Administrator will be final 
 27 

and binding. 8.2 Limited Liability 
 Neither the Administrator, nor any of its members or designees, will be liable to any person for any action taken or omitted in connection with the interpretation and administration of this Plan. ARTICLE 9 AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF PLAN 
 9.1 Authority to Amend or Terminate 
 The Administrator will have full power and authority to prospectively modify or terminate this Plan, and the Administrator s interpretations, constructions and actions, including any determination of the Participant s account or benefits, or the amount or recipient of the payment to be made, will be binding and conclusive on all persons for all purposes. Absent the consent of the Participant, however, the Administrator will in no event have any authority to modify this section. However, no such amendment or termination will apply to any person who has then qualified for or is receiving benefits under this Plan. 9.2 Limitations 
 In the event of Plan amendment or termination which has the effect of eliminating or reducing a benefit under the Plan, the benefit payable on account of a retired Participant or Beneficiary will not be impaired, and the benefits of other Participants will not be less than the benefit to which each such Participant would have been entitled if he or she had retired immediately prior to such amendment or termination. ARTICLE 10 CLAIMS AND REVIEW PROCEDURES 
 10.1 Claims Procedure for Claims Other Than Due to Disability (a) Except for claims due to Disability, the Administrator will notify a Participant or his or her Beneficiary (or person submitting a claim on behalf of the Participant or Beneficiary) (a claimant in writing, within 90 days after his or her written application for benefits, of his or her eligibility or noneligibility for benefits under the Plan. If the Administrator determines that a claimant is not eligible for benefits or full benefits, the notice will set forth (1) the specific reasons for the denial, (2) a specific reference to the provisions of the Plan on which the denial is based, (3) a description of any additional information or material necessary for the claimant to perfect his or her claim, and a description of why it is needed, and (4) an explanation of the Plan s claims review procedure and other appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the claimant wishes to have the claim reviewed. If the Administrator determines that there are special circumstances requiring additional time to make a decision, the Administrator will notify the claimant of the special circumstances and the date by which a decision is expected to be made, and may extend the time for up to an additional 90-day period. 

 28 

(b) If a claimant is determined by the Administrator not to be eligible for benefits, or if the claimant believes that he or she is entitled to greater or different benefits, the claimant will have the opportunity to have the claim reviewed by the Administrator by filing a petition for review with the Administrator within 60 days after receipt of the notice issued by the Administrator. Said petition will state the specific reasons which the claimant believes entitle him or her to benefits or to greater or different benefits. Within 60 days after receipt by the Administrator of the petition, the Administrator will afford the claimant (and counsel, if any) an opportunity to present his or her position to the Administrator in writing, and the claimant (or counsel) will have the right to review the pertinent documents. The Administrator will notify the claimant of its decision in writing within the 60-day period, stating specifically the basis of its decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and the specific provisions of the Plan on which the decision is based. If, due to special circumstances (for example, because of the need for a hearing), the 60-day period is not sufficient, the decision may be deferred for up to another 60-day period at the election of the Administrator, but notice of this deferral will be given to the claimant. In the event of the death of the Participant, the same procedures will apply to the Participant s Beneficiaries. 
 
 10.2 Claims Procedure for Claims Due to Disability (a) For purposes of Section 10.1, this Section 10.2 and Section 10.3, a claim shall not be considered to be due to Disability if the existence of the Participant s Disability is determined by reference to whether the Participant is eligible for benefits under his or her Employer s long-term disability plan applicable to the Participant, as determined by the Employer. A claim due to Disability will be approved or denied by the Administrator or its delegate, as it deems appropriate in its discretion, based on its interpretation of the Plan, medical evidence, and the analysis and conclusions of a physician selected by the Administrator or its delegate. Within a reasonable period of time, but not later than 45 days after receipt of a claim due to Disability, the Administrator or its delegate shall notify the claimant of any adverse benefit determination on the claim, unless circumstances beyond the Plan s control require an extension of time for processing the claim. Except as contemplated by this Section 10.2, in no event may the extension period exceed 30 days from the end of the initial 45-day period. If an extension is necessary, the Administrator or its delegate shall provide the claimant with a written notice to this effect prior to the expiration of the initial 45-day period. The notice shall describe the circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Administrator or its delegate expects to render a determination on the claim. If, prior to the end of the first 30-day extension period, the Administrator or its delegate determines that, due to circumstances beyond the control of the Plan, a decision cannot be rendered within that extension period, the period for making the determination may be extended for an additional 30 days, so long as the Administrator or its delegate notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the first 30-day extension period, of the circumstances requiring the extension and the date as of which the Administrator or its delegate expects to render a decision. This notice of extension shall specifically describe the standards on which entitlement to a benefit is based, the unresolved issues that prevent a decision on the claim, and the additional information needed to resolve those issues, and that the claimant has at least 45 days within which to provide the specified information. Furthermore, in the event that a period of time is extended as permitted due to a claimant s failure to submit information necessary to decide a claim, the period for making the benefit determination shall be tolled from the date on which the notification of the extension is 

 29 

sent to the claimant until the date on which the claimant responds to the request for additional information. 
 (b) In the case of an adverse benefit determination, the Administrator or its delegate shall provide to the claimant written or electronic notification setting forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner: (i) the specific reason or reasons for the adverse benefit determination; (ii) reference to the specific Plan provisions on which the adverse benefit determination is based; (iii) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why the material or information is necessary; (iv) a description of the Plan s claim review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of the claimant s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse final benefit determination on review and in accordance with Section 10.2(c) below; (v) either the specific internal rules, guidelines, protocols, standards or other similar criteria of the Plan relied upon in making the adverse determination or a statement that such rules, guidelines, protocols, standards or other similar criteria of the Plan do not exist; (vi) if the determination is based on a medical necessity or experimental treatment or similar exclusion or limit, either an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for the determination, applying the terms of the Plan to the claimant s medical circumstances, or a statement that such explanation shall be provided free of charge upon request; (vii) a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claimant s claim for benefits; and (viii) a discussion of the decision, including an explanation of the basis for disagreeing with or not following: (a) the views presented by the claimant to the Plan of health care professionals treating the claimant and vocational professionals who evaluated the claimant; (b) the views of medical or vocational experts whose advice was obtained on behalf of the Plan in connection with a claimant s adverse benefit determination, without regard to whether the advice was relied upon in making the benefit determination; and (c) a disability determination made by the Social Security Administration regarding the claimant presented by the claimant to the Plan. 
 (c) Any good-faith determination by the Administrator or its delegate will be final and binding on the Plan and the claimant unless appealed in accordance with this Section 10.2(c). Within 180 days after receipt by the claimant of notification of the adverse benefit determination, the claimant or the claimant s duly authorized representative, upon written application to the Administrator, may request that the Plan fully and fairly review the adverse benefit determination (also sometimes referred to herein as an appeal ). Upon request and free of charge, the claimant pursuing an appeal shall have reasonable access to, and be provided copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claimant s claim for benefits. The claimant shall have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information relating to the claim for benefits. The review: (i) shall take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted regardless of whether the information was previously submitted or considered in the initial adverse benefit determination; (ii) shall not afford deference to the initial adverse benefit determination; (iii) shall be conducted, at the direction of the Administrator, by an appropriate fiduciary of the Plan who is neither the individual who made the adverse benefit determination that is the subject of the review, nor the subordinate of such individual; (iv) shall identify medical and vocational experts whose advice was obtained on behalf of the Plan in connection with the initial adverse 

 30 

benefit determination, without regard to whether the advice was relied upon in making the benefit determination; and (v) where based in whole or in part on medical evidence or medical judgment, including determinations with regard to whether a particular treatment, drug, or other item is experimental, investigational, or not medically necessary or appropriate, shall include consultation with a physician, with appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the medical judgment, who was neither consulted in connection with the initial adverse benefit determination, nor the subordinate of any such professional.
 
 The appeal will then be approved or denied by the Administrator or its delegate, as it deems appropriate, based on its interpretation of the Plan in light of the medical evidence. Before an adverse benefit determination on review of a claim due to Disability is issued, the claimant shall be provided, free of charge, with any new or additional evidence considered, relied upon, or generated by the Administrator or its delegate making the benefit determination (or at the direction of the Administrator) in connection with the claim; such evidence will be provided as soon as possible and sufficiently in advance of the date on which the notice of adverse benefit determination on review is required to be provided to give the claimant a reasonable opportunity to respond prior to that date. Also before an adverse benefit determination on review based on a new or additional rationale is issued, the claimant shall be provided, free of charge, the rationale; the rationale must be provided as soon as possible and sufficiently in advance of the date on which the notice of adverse benefit determination on review is required to be provided to give the claimant a reasonable opportunity to respond prior to that date. A final benefit determination will be made by the Administrator or its delegate, and the Administrator or its delegate shall provide the claimant with written or electronic notification of the final benefit determination within a reasonable period of time, but no later than 45 days immediately following receipt of claimant s request for review, unless special circumstances require a further extension of time for processing the claim, which extension may be up to an additional 45 days. If such an extension of time for review is required because of special circumstances, the Administrator or its delegate shall provide the claimant with a written notice of the extension prior to the commencement of the extension. The notice shall describe the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date as of which the final benefit determination shall be made. In the event that a period of time is extended due to a claimant s failure to submit information necessary to decide a claim, the period for making the benefit determination on review shall be tolled from the date on which the notification of the extension is sent to the claimant until the date on which the claimant responds to the request for additional information. In the case of an adverse final benefit determination, the Administrator or its delegate shall provide to the claimant written or electronic notification setting forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner: (i) the specific reason or reasons for the adverse final benefit determination; (ii) reference to the specific Plan provisions on which the adverse final benefit determination is based; (iii) a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claimant s claim for benefits; (iv) a statement of the claimant s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse final benefit determination on review and 
 31 

mandatory arbitration in accordance with Section 10.3 below; (v) either the specific internal rules, guidelines, protocols, standards or other similar criteria of the Plan relied upon in making the adverse determination or a statement that such rules, guidelines, protocols, standards or other similar criteria of the Plan do not exist; (vi) if the determination is based on a medical necessity or experimental treatment or similar exclusion or limit, an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for the determination, applying the terms of the Plan to the claimant s medical circumstances, or a statement that such explanation shall be provided free of charge upon request; (vii) a discussion of the decision, including an explanation of the basis for disagreeing with or not following: (a) the views presented by the claimant to the Plan of health care professionals treating the claimant and vocational professionals who evaluated the claimant; (b) the views of medical or vocational experts whose advice was obtained on behalf of the Plan in connection with a claimant s adverse benefit determination, without regard to whether the advice was relied upon in making the benefit determination; and (c) a disability determination made by the Social Security Administration regarding the claimant presented by the claimant to the Plan; and (viii) the following statement: You and your plan may have other voluntary alternative dispute resolution options, such as mediation. One way to find out what may be available is to contact your local U.S. Department of Labor Office and your State insurance regulatory agency. As described above, there shall be only one level of review of an adverse benefit determination, followed by mandatory arbitration under Section 10.3, before a claimant may bring a civil action pursuant to Section 502 of ERISA. 10.3 Dispute Arbitration (a) Effective as to any claims filed on or after June 19, 2014, final and binding arbitration under this Section 10.3 shall be the sole remedy available to a claimant after he or she has exhausted the claim and review procedures set forth in Section 10.1. Furthermore, exhaustion by the claimant of the claim and review procedures set forth in Section 10.1 is a mandatory prerequisite for binding arbitration under this Section 10.3. Any arbitration or civil action brought prior to the exhaustion of the claim and review procedures set forth in Section 10.1 shall be remanded to the Administrator to permit the claim and review procedures to be exhausted. 
 (b) After a claimant has exhausted the claim and review procedures set forth in Section 10.1, if the claimant is determined by the Administrator not to be eligible for benefits, or if the claimant believes that he or she is entitled to greater or different benefits, the claimant may submit his or her claim to final and binding arbitration under this Section 10.3.
 
 Any arbitration under this Section 10.3 will be held in Los Angeles County, California, in accordance with the then-current JAMS Arbitration Rules and Procedures for Employment Disputes JAMS Rules and under the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitration shall be before a single neutral arbitrator licensed to practice law and experienced in employee benefits law as well as the laws governing nonqualified deferred compensation plans, selected by mutual agreement of the parties. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be selected by striking in accordance with the then-current JAMS Rules from a list of arbitrators supplied by JAMS. Any and all claims and/or defenses that would otherwise be available in a court of law will be fully available to the parties. The arbitrator selected pursuant to this paragraph (the Arbitrator may order such discovery as is necessary for a full and fair 
 32 

exploration of the issues and dispute, consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration. The Arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law to resolve the dispute. To the fullest extent provided by federal law, the decision rendered by the Administrator pursuant to the claim and review procedures set forth in Section 10.1 shall be upheld by the Arbitrator unless the Arbitrator determines that the Administrator abused its discretion. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a Change in Control occurs, then a claim review decision rendered by the Administrator within the three years following the Change in Control shall, if it is challenged by the claimant in accordance with this Section 10.3, be subject to de novo review by the Arbitrator. Subject to the applicable standard of review in the preceding two sentences, the Arbitrator may grant any award or relief available under applicable law that the Arbitrator deems just and equitable. At the conclusion of the arbitration, the Arbitrator shall issue a written decision that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions upon which the Arbitrator s award or decision is based. Any award or relief granted by the Arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties hereto, and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The Administrator will pay the Arbitrator s fee and arbitration forum fees, to the extent required by law. Otherwise, each party shall be solely responsible for paying his/her/their/its own costs/fees for the arbitration, including but not limited to attorneys fees. However, the Arbitrator in his or her discretion may allow reasonable attorney s fees and costs of action to either party to the same extent as would be permissible if the claim(s) were filed in a court of law in lieu of arbitration. (c) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this Section 10.3, if the claim is due to Disability, the following rules apply: (1) arbitration under this Section 10.3 shall be the mandatory second level of appeal following the exhaustion by the claimant of the claim and review procedures set forth in Section 10.2, and such exhaustion is a mandatory prerequisite for arbitration under this Section 10.3 any arbitration or civil action brought with respect to a claim due to Disability prior to the exhaustion of the claim and review procedures set forth in Section 10.2 shall be remanded to the Administrator to permit the claim and review procedures to be exhausted; (2) arbitration of a claim due to Disability under this Section 10.3 shall not be binding, and the claimant shall not be precluded from challenging the decision of the Arbitrator in a civil action brought pursuant to Section 502(a) of ERISA; and (3) except as specifically set forth in this Section 10.3(c), if the claim is due to Disability, the arbitration shall be conducted as set forth in Section 10.3(b).
 (d) Effective as to any claims filed on or after January 1, 2024, t he Officer, Executive, Participant, or Beneficiary must bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class, collective or representative basis and must waive the right to commence, be a party to, or be an actual or putative class member of any class, collective or representative action arising out of or relating to the Plan, including, but not limited to, any claims related to the Plan class action waiver ). However, if this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then any claim on a class, collective or representative basis shall be filed and adjudicated in a court of competent jurisdiction, and not in arbitration. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this Section 10.3 is intended to make mandatory individual arbitration apply, as described above, to the maximum extent permissible under ERISA; if any feature of this arbitration requirement is impermissible under ERISA, arbitration as described above shall remain required with the minimum change necessary to allow the arbitration requirement to be permissible under ERISA. This Section 10.3(d) shall only apply 

 33 

with respect to an Officer, Executive or Participant hired (including those rehired) by an Employer on or after January 1, 2024 and to any Beneficiary thereof. 
 
 ARTICLE 11 MISCELLANEOUS 
 11.1 Participation in Other Plans 
 Participation in this Plan will not limit a Participant s ability to continue to participate in any other employee benefit program of an Employer, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the applicable employee benefit program. 11.2 Relationship to Qualified Plan 
 This Plan will to the fullest extent possible under currently applicable law be administered in accordance with, and where practicable according to the terms of the Qualified Plan and/or Savings Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Plan shall control benefits payable under this Plan whenever the terms of the Qualified Plan and/or Savings Plan differ from this Plan. 11.3 Forfeiture 
 The payments to be made pursuant to the Plan require the Participant, for so long as the Participant remains in the active employ of the Employer, to devote substantially all of his or her time, skill, diligence and attention to the business of the Employer and not to actively engage, either directly or indirectly, in any business or other activity adverse to the best interests of the business of the Employer. In addition, the Participant will remain available during Retirement for consultation in any matter related to the affairs of the Employer. Any breach of these conditions by a Participant will result in complete forfeiture by the Participant of any further benefits under the Plan. If the Participant fails to observe any of the above conditions, or if he or she is discharged by the Employer for malfeasance or willful neglect of duty, then in any of said events, the Participant s benefits under this Plan will terminate and will not be paid, and EIX and the Employer will have no further liability therefor. 11.4 Successors 
 The rights and obligations of each Employer under the Plan will inure to the benefit of, and will be binding upon, the successors and assigns of the Employer. 11.5 Trust 
 The Employers will be responsible for the payment of all benefits under the Plan. At their discretion, the Employers may establish one or more grantor trusts for the purpose of providing for payment of benefits under the Plan. The trust or trusts may be irrevocable, but an Employer s share of the assets thereof will be subject to the claims of the Employer s creditors. Benefits paid to the Participant from any such trust will be considered paid by the Employer for purposes of meeting the obligations of the Employer under the Plan. 
 34 

11.6 Employment Not Guaranteed 
 Nothing contained in the Plan nor any action taken hereunder will be construed as a contract of employment or as giving any Participant any right to continue in employment with the Employer or any other Affiliate. 11.7 Gender, Singular and Plural 
 All pronouns and variations thereof will be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine, or neuter, as the identity of the person or persons may require. As the context may require, the singular may be read as the plural and the plural as the singular. 11.8 Captions 
 The captions of the articles and sections of the Plan are for convenience only and will not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of its provisions. 11.9 Validity 
 If any provision of the Plan is held invalid, void or unenforceable, the same will not affect, in any respect whatsoever, the validity of any other provisions of the Plan. 11.10 Waiver of Breach 
 The waiver by EIX or the Administrator of any breach of any provision of the Plan by the Participant will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by the Participant. 11.11 Applicable Law 
 The Plan will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of California except where the laws of California are preempted by ERISA. 11.12 Notice 
 Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Administrator under the Plan will be sufficient if in writing and hand-delivered, or sent by first class mail to the principal office of EIX, directed to the attention of the Administrator. The notice will be deemed given as of the date of delivery, or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark. 11.13 ERISA Plan 
 The Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan maintained primarily to provide deferred compensation benefits for a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of Sections 201, 301 and 401 of ERISA and therefore to be exempt from Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA. EIX is the named fiduciary. 
 35 

11.14 Statutes and Regulations 
 Any reference to a statute or regulation herein shall include any successor to such statute or regulation. IN WITNESS WHEREOF , EIX has amended and restated this Plan on the 21st day of August, 2024. EDISON INTERNATIONAL /s/ Natalie Schilling Natalie Schilling Senior Vice President, Human Resources
