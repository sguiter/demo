Going
Concern 

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate
on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable
and accounts payable and capital expenditures. 

During
the past two years, we devoted a substantial amount of capital to build out our platform and as a result our working capital deficit
and accumulated deficit have increased significantly. In addition, we have incurred significant debt from both unrelated and related
parties to assist in supporting our operations. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had in cash. During the last two years we built our platform and grew our operations by acquiring
companies to support what we have just recently consolidated into HUMBL.com. The acquisitions increased our debt and our common shares
issued as we spent very little cash in these acquisitions. The impact of COVID-19, supply chain issues, challenges in the cryptocurrency
market and recent bank failures have had a minimal impact on the Company s operations. 

We
had a working capital deficit of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The majority
of our current liabilities is in the form of long-term debt and notes payable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses. The decrease
in working capital is the direct result of reductions of notes payable, accrued interest and accrued expenses as well as the change in
the contingent consideration. A majority of the Company s operating expenses in the past two years was the result of non-cash charges
such as impairment of intangible assets including goodwill, settlement and stock-based compensation. The actual monthly cash burn of
the Company is approximately per month at this time and as our core products come online, this is likely to decrease upon our
technology being completed. The Company in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 received net proceeds of approximately 
from various debt and warrant financings. However, as a result of the operating losses and working capital deficit, management has determined
that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

In
January 2023 and June 2023, we recognized a gain on disposal of when we settled all claims with the former owners of Tickeri
and Monster and sold them back their companies. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of the change in the net loss and the non-cash
charges impacting our net loss from 2023 to 2024, such as the gain on the sale of HUMBL Financial assets, and decreases in our stock-based
compensation. Additionally, our changes in assets and liabilities increased by approximately . 

We
had no activities from investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Cash
provided by financing activities was and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In
2024, the Company raised from the proceeds from convertible notes, from related party notes payable and 
from notes payable as well as repayments of convertible notes payable of and raised from the sale of warrants. In 2023,
we raised from the sale of stock, from proceeds of convertible notes payable and from related party notes
payable, from the sale of Series C Preferred Stock and from a contribution of capital by our CEO and from notes
payable. We also repaid of notes payable. 

We
expect that the consolidation of our platform into HUMBL.com will bring about revenue producing operations to improve the liquidity of
the Company moving forward. However, going forward, the effect of our industry on the capital markets may limit our ability to raise
additional capital on the terms acceptable to us at the time we need it, if at all. The additional post-COVID challenges related to remote
work and travel restrictions that we as a smaller company have faced in striving to meet our disclosure obligations in a timely manner
while taking the steps to protect the health and safety of our employees have impacted, and may continue to further impact, our ability
to raise additional capital. 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over
a reasonable period. The consolidated financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome
of the uncertainties. 

Impact
of Cryptocurrency Bankruptcies 

In
November 2022, both FTX Trading and BlockFi filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. These bankruptcies have impacted several
companies either directly or indirectly. Customers of the HUMBL Wallet use our platform to hold their cryptocurrency. Assets related
to user cryptocurrencies safeguarding obligation and the user cryptocurrencies safeguarding obligation represent the Company s
obligation to safeguard customers crypto assets in digital wallets on the Company s platform. The Company safeguards these
assets for customers and is obligated to safeguard them from loss, theft, or other misuse. The Company recognizes the users cryptocurrencies
liabilities and corresponding assets related to the users cryptocurrencies, on initial recognition and at each reporting date, at fair
value of the crypto assets. Any loss, theft, or misuse would impact the measurement of users crypto assets. We removed the HUMBL Pay
app from the Apple App Store and Google Play store on January 31, 2023 and have migrated all customers from HUMBL Pay to the HUMBL Wallet.
HUMBL Wallet users maintain their own private digital wallets where the cryptocurrency is held and HUMBL has no access to those wallets.
In addition, Wyre informed us they will no longer accept any cryptocurrency in our platform effective July 31, 2023. Any funds that remain
as of that date will be considered unclaimed funds, and we expect nominal SAB 121 amounts to be reflected in the future. 

We
do not, nor have we ever used either of these exchanges to conduct business. We have not been impacted by these bankruptcies. And we
continue to monitor the industry and protect our customers assets.

30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company has at times maintained cash balances in excess of the FDIC insured limit at
a single bank. 

In
2022, the Company established a service to their HUMBL Pay app users. The service enables HUMBL Pay app users the ability through a Company
maintained digital asset wallet with Wyre Wyre to purchase digital assets (cryptocurrency). As it can take 5 to 8 business
days to physically settle funds in the Wyre wallet, there may be delays in digital assets being received by customers and the delivery
of BLOCKS in a BitGo wallet BitGo ). BitGo is a third-party custodian service that provides the custody for the customers 
BLOCKS. 

The
BitGo account is not the Company s account; however, it represents the pool of all BLOCKS held by and allocated to HUMBL Pay users
accounts. The users may choose to transfer the purchased BLOCKS to their individual wallets outside of HUMBL. 

The
services related to Wyre and BitGo are no longer being offered as we have shut down our HUMBL Pay app. We currently hold digital assets. 

Fixed
assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets
with infinite lives, such as digital currency are valued at costs and reviewed for indicators of impairment at least annually, or more
depending on circumstances. 

The
Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers to be important which could trigger an impairment review include the following: 

1.
Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; 

2.
Significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; and 

3.
Significant negative industry or economic trends. 

When
the Company determines that the carrying value of intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above
indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows, the Company
records an impairment charge. The Company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate
determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model. Significant management judgment is
required in determining whether an indicator of impairment exists and in projecting cash flows. 

The
Company uses the output method and apply the practical expedient to recognize advertising revenue in the amount to which they have a
right to invoice. For contracts with target advertising commitments with rebates, estimated payout is accounted for as a variable consideration
to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. 

HUMBL
Tickets 

The
Company recognizes revenues from HUMBL Tickets primarily from service fees. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods
or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we receive in exchange for those goods or services.
For service fees and payment processing fees, revenue is recognized when the ticket is sold. 

We
evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon our evaluation of whether we obtain control
of the specified goods or services by considering if we are primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise, have inventory risk,
and have the latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers, among other factors. 

For
the payment processing service, we determined that we are the principal in providing the service as we are responsible for fulfilling
the promise to process the payment and we have discretion and latitude in establishing the price of our service. Based on our assessment,
we record revenue on a net basis related to our ticketing service and on a gross basis related to our payment processing service. As
a result, costs incurred for processing the transactions are included in cost of net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Revenue
is presented net of indirect taxes, value-added taxes, creator royalties and reserves for customer refunds, payment chargebacks and estimated
uncollectible amounts. If an event is cancelled by a creator, then any obligations to provide refunds to event attendees are the responsibility
of that creator. 

If
a creator is unwilling or unable to fulfill their refund obligations, we may, at our discretion, provide attendee refunds. Revenue is
also presented net of the amortization of creator signing fees when applicable. The benefit we receive by securing exclusive ticketing
and payment processing rights with certain creators from creator signing fees is inseparable from the customer relationship with the
creator and accordingly these fees are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. 

HUMBL
Marketplace 

The
Company recognizes revenue when they transfer control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which is expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected, which
are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. 

Net
transaction revenues 

The
net transaction revenues will primarily include final value fees, feature fees, including fees to promote listings, and listing fees
from sellers in our Marketplace. The net transaction revenues will also include store subscription and other fees often from large enterprise
sellers. The net transaction revenues are reduced by incentives provided to customers. 

The
Company has identified one performance obligation to sellers on the Marketplace platform, which is to connect buyers and sellers on the
secure and trusted Marketplace platforms. Final value fees are recognized when an item is sold on a Marketplace platform, satisfying
this performance obligation. There may be additional services available to Marketplace sellers, mainly to promote or feature listings,
that are not distinct within the context of the contract. 

Accordingly,
fees for these additional services are recognized when the single performance obligation is satisfied. Promoted listing fees are recognized
when the item is sold and feature and listing fees are recognized when an item is sold, or when the contract expires. 

Further,
to drive traffic to the platform, the Company will provide incentives to buyers and sellers in various forms including discounts on fees,
discounts on items sold, coupons and rewards. Evaluating whether a promotion or incentive is a payment to a customer may require significant
judgment. Promotions and incentives which are consideration payable to a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the later
of when revenue is recognized or when the incentive is paid or promised to be paid. Promotions and incentives to most buyers on our Marketplace
platforms, to whom there is no performance obligation, are recognized as sales and marketing expense. In addition, there may be credits
provided to customers when certain fees are refunded. Credits are accounted for as variable consideration at contract inception when
estimating the amount of revenue to be recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied to the extent that it is probable that a
significant reversal of revenue will not occur and updated as additional information becomes available. 

HUMBL
Blockchain Services 

The
Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers into product revenues and services revenues. 

Product
revenue related contracts with customers begin upon contract inception when a purchase order for a specific customer order of a product
to be delivered in the near term. These purchase orders are short-term in nature. Product revenue is recognized at a point in time upon
shipment or upon customer receipt of the product, depending on shipping terms. The Company determined that this method best represents
the transfer of goods as transfer of control typically occurs upon shipment or upon customer receipt of the product. 

Service
revenues primarily consist of revenues derived from maintenance support and the use of the Company s service platforms and application
programming interface APIs on a subscription basis. The Company generates this revenue from fees for maintenance and
support, monthly active user fees, SaaS fees, and hosting and storage fees. In most cases, the subscription or transaction arrangement
is a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same
pattern of transfer (i.e., distinct days of service). The Company applies a time-based measure of progress to the total transaction price,
which results in ratable recognition over the term of the contract. The Company determined that this method best represents the transfer
of services as the customer obtains equal benefit from the service throughout the service period. 

The
Company accounts for individual goods and services separately if they are distinct performance obligations, which often requires significant
judgment based upon knowledge of the products and/or services, the solution provided and the structure of the sales contract. In SaaS
agreements, the Company provides a service to the customer that combines the software functionality, maintenance and hosting into a single
performance obligation. In product-related contracts, a purchase order may cover different products, each constituting a separate performance
obligation.

with 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of development costs related to the increase of a service provider
for the recent patent received. 

Professional
Fees 

Professional
fees which consist of contracted individuals and companies, legal, audit and accounting costs for the three months ended September 30,
2024 were 282,002 compared to 740,247 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in professional fees related to the
professional fees incurred in regulatory filings including OTC compliance and reporting as well as increases in consultant costs in 2023
versus 2024. We expect that these costs will stabilize during 2024. 

Settlement 

The
Company incurred 210,000 in settlement expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 806,400 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023 related to agreements with consultants, advisors, and directors for services rendered. We expect to settle additional
amounts through the end of our fiscal year end. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company incurred 1,227,120 in stock-based compensation expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,853,653
for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to agreements with consultants, advisors, and directors for services rendered.
We expect our stock-based compensation expenses to decline in the next 12 months due to the vesting terms of such grants. The awards
provided were valued in accordance with ASC 718 at fair value. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 288,205 compared with 452,424 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses of 164,219 is related to the following approximate reductions
in salaries and wages, advertising, business development expenses, insurance, rent, and security. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

In
the three months ended September 30, 2024 we incurred 385,244 in other expenses, compared to 1,251,891 in other expenses in the three
months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 866,647 in other expenses. The main contributing factors of this increase from 2023 to
2024 mostly related to interest expense, and the loss on the conversion of convertible debt. We expect to incur additional other income
(expense) in the next 12 months related to our debt. 

41 

Net
Loss from Continuing Operations 

Net
loss from operations from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,330,970) as compared to a net loss
of 5,843,053) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 3,512,083 decrease in the net loss was due to the changes noted herein. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate
on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable
and accounts payable and capital expenditures. 

During
the past two years, we devoted a substantial amount of capital to build out our platform and as a result our working capital deficit
and accumulated deficit have increased significantly. In addition, we have incurred significant debt from both unrelated and related
parties to assist in supporting our operations. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 274,173 in cash. During the last two years we built our platform and grew our operations by acquiring
companies to support what we have just recently consolidated into HUMBL.com. The acquisitions increased our debt and our common shares
issued as we spent very little cash in these acquisitions. The impact of COVID-19, supply chain issues, challenges in the cryptocurrency
market and recent bank failures have had a minimal impact on the Company s operations. 

We
had a working capital deficit of 1,929,470 and 4,690,800 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The majority
of our current liabilities is in the form of long-term debt and notes payable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses. The decrease
in working capital is the direct result of reductions of notes payable, accrued interest and accrued expenses as well as the change in
the contingent consideration. A majority of the Company s operating expenses in the past two years was the result of non-cash charges
such as impairment of intangible assets including goodwill, settlement and stock-based compensation. The actual monthly cash burn of
the Company is approximately 204,000 per month at this time and as our core products come online, this is likely to decrease upon our
technology being completed. The Company in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 received net proceeds of approximately 1,745,000
from various debt and warrant financings. However, as a result of the operating losses and working capital deficit, management has determined
that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

In
January 2023 and June 2023, we recognized a gain on disposal of 13,685,645 when we settled all claims with the former owners of Tickeri
and Monster and sold them back their companies. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 1,833,961 and 2,959,691 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The 1,164,322 decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of the change in the net loss and the non-cash
charges impacting our net loss from 2023 to 2024, such as the gain on the sale of HUMBL Financial assets, and decreases in our stock-based
compensation. Additionally, our changes in assets and liabilities increased by approximately 54,000. 

We
had no activities from investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Cash
provided by financing activities was 1,744,880 and 2,621,748 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In
2024, the Company raised 1,025,488 from the proceeds from convertible notes, 395,500 from related party notes payable and 530,000
from notes payable as well as repayments of convertible notes payable of 317,108 and raised 111,000 from the sale of warrants. In 2023,
we raised 360,050 from the sale of stock, 1,525,000 from proceeds of convertible notes payable and 1,050,000 from related party notes
payable, 100,000 from the sale of Series C Preferred Stock and 50,000 from a contribution of capital by our CEO and 50,000 from notes
payable. We also repaid 503,441 of notes payable. 

We
expect that the consolidation of our platform into HUMBL.com as well as our arrangement with the AFL will bring about revenue producing
operations to improve the liquidity of the Company moving forward. However, going forward, the effect of our industry on the capital
markets may limit our ability to raise additional capital on the terms acceptable to us at the time we need it, if at all. The additional
post-COVID challenges related to remote work and travel restrictions that we as a smaller company have faced in striving to meet our
disclosure obligations in a timely manner while taking the steps to protect the health and safety of our employees have impacted, and
may continue to further impact, our ability to raise additional capital. 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over
a reasonable period. The consolidated financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome
of the uncertainties. 

42 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include,
but are not limited to, management s estimate of provisions required for permanent and temporary differences related to income
taxes, liabilities to accrue, estimates of the fair value of goodwill and determination of the fair value of stock awards. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Inventory 

Inventory
is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using the first-in first-out method. The carrying value
of inventory is evaluated periodically for excess quantities and obsolescence. Management evaluates quantities on hand and physical condition
as these characteristics may be impacted by anticipated customer demand for current products. The allowance is adjusted based on such
evaluation, with a corresponding provision included in cost of sales. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

ASC
825 Financial Instruments requires the Company to disclose estimated fair values for its financial instruments. Fair value estimates,
methods, and assumptions are set forth below for the Company s financial instruments: The carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable,
prepaid and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and amounts payable to related parties, approximate fair
value because of the short-term maturity of those instruments. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company accounts for a contract with a customer that is within the scope of ASC 606 only when the five steps of revenue recognition under
ASC 606 are met. 

We
account for revenues based on the verticals in which they were earned, the three principal verticals being (1) HUMBL Wallet, (2) HUMBL
Marketplace, and (3) HBS Commercial division. See Revenue Recognition in Note 2 of our Financial Statements. 

43 

The
Company has a core revenue focus on: 

1. 
 HUMBL
 Wallet 

2. 
 HUMBL.com
 Web Platform 

3. 
 HBS
 Commercial Division - Powered by HUMBL 

The
Company plans to drive its revenues through the following channels: 

HUMBL
Wallet 

The
 Company will drive consumer acquisition primarily through the digital wallet. Consumers can be monetized inside a digital wallet
 through the delivery of search advertising, social media advertising, loyalty advertising, credit card payment transactions, ticketing
 sales, certificates of authenticity and more. 

HUMBL
Web Platform 

The
 Company has developed one of the first digital wallet and web platforms that are connected together. This means that any verified
 customers using the HUMBL.com web platform, are also connected to a digital wallet for consumer and merchant transactions. 

The
 HUMBL.com platform can be used to drive search advertising, social media advertising, loyalty advertising, credit card payment transactions,
 ticketing sales, certificates of authenticity, authentic merchandise purchases and more. 

HBS
Commercial Services Powered by HUMBL 

HUMBL
 also packages its digital wallet and web platform for white-labeling by clients. 

Government
 HUMBL has secured approval to build a digital wallet for the County of Santa Cruz, CA. This digital wallet will be built
 in a modular way, that can be replicated for other cities, counties, states and national government transactions and record keeping
 in areas such as licensing, renewals and certificates. Once built, HUMBL will offer these digital wallets for government in exchange
 for flat fee, a percentage of transactions, or a mix of both. 

Stadiums,
 Arenas and Leagues HUMBL has secured approval to serve as the Official Technology Platform of the Arena Football
 League (AFL), which is currently comprised of 16 teams through the 2028 season. HUMBL will deliver digital wallet and web platform
 services, with the goal of maximizing ticket revenues, merchandise sales and advertising programs across league digital properties.
 HUMBL will be paid a percentage on every ticket sold by the league, with annual escalators through the end of the 2028 season. HUMBL
 will seek to replicate this model across other teams, sports leagues, stadiums, arenas and festivals.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based
on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d)
and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

44 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, our management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. The design
of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On
May 19, 2022, we were named as a defendant in a putative shareholder derivative class action lawsuit filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of California styled Matt Pasquinelli and Bryan Paysen v. HUMBL, LLC, Brian Foote, Jeffrey Hinshaw
and George Sharp, Case No. 22CV0723 AJB BLM . The complaint alleges federal securities law violations by the Company, including false
or misleading statements regarding our business and operations, that the HUMBL Pay App did not have the functionality that it promised
to investors and that several international business partnerships had a low chance of contributing material revenues to our bottom line,
and sales of unregistered securities through our BLOCK Exchange Traded Index products, which plaintiffs allege caused a decline in the
market value of our shares of common stock. Plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages. On July 7, 2023, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of California granted our Motion to Transfer Venue and transferred the case to the District Court of
Delaware. On October 30, 2023, we filed a Motion to Dismiss the lawsuit with the District Court of Delaware which the parties have fully
briefed and which motion is presently pending for resolution before the court. We intend to vigorously defend the actions of the defendants
and contest what we believe are baseless claims.

July 14, 2022, we were named as ae defendant in a putative shareholder derivative class action lawsuit filed in the Delaware Chancery
Court styled Mike Armstrong, derivatively on behalf of HUMBL, Inc. v. Brian Foote, Jeffrey Hinshaw, George Sharp, Michele Rivera,
and William B. Hoagland (Case No. 2022-0620). This case alleges the same claims as the Pasquinelli litigation described above and
also seeks unspecified monetary damages. The case is currently stayed by agreement of the parties. We intend to vigorously defend the
actions of the defendants and contest what we believe are baseless claims.

March 11, 2024, Pacific Lion filed a lawsuit against the Company in Pinellas County, Florida alleging breaches of the contracts entered
into in connection with certain loans made by Pacific Lion to the Company and certain related claims. On March 13, 2023, Pacific Lion
also filed a lawsuit against the Company in Orange County, California alleging breach of the SPA and the other contracts entered in connection
with Pacific Lion s purchase of Series C Preferred Stock from the Company and certain related claims. 

On
