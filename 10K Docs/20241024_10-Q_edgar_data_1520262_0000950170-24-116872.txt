 per share, of Mural for every ten ordinary shares, par value per share, of the Company held by such shareholder as of the close of business on November 6, 2023, the record date for the Distribution. The historical results of the oncology business have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company s accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and as of December 31, 2023. In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a separation agreement with Mural, dated as of November 13, 2023 (the Separation Agreement ), that, among other things, sets forth the Company s agreements with Mural regarding the principal actions taken or to be taken in connection with the Separation, including the Distribution. The Separation Agreement identified those assets to be transferred to, liabilities to be assumed by, and contracts to be assigned to Mural, including the operating lease for the office and laboratory space at 852 Winter Street in Waltham, Massachusetts, and it provided for when and how such transfers, assumptions and assignments were to occur. The purpose of the Separation Agreement was to provide Mural and the Company with those assets necessary to operate their respective businesses and to retain or assume the respective liabilities related to those assets. Each of Mural and the Company agreed to releases with respect to pre-Distribution claims, and cross-indemnities with respect to post-Distribution claims, that were principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities allocated to Mural under the Separation Agreement, and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities allocated to the Company under the Separation Agreement. The Company and Mural are also each subject to certain confidentiality restrictions and information sharing obligations.

The Company determined that the Separation and the Distribution qualified as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which required significant judgment by management. In making such determination, the Company applied U.S. federal tax law to relevant facts and circumstances and obtained: (i) a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service; (ii) a tax opinion; and (iii) other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the Separation and Distribution were to ultimately fail to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company and/or its shareholders could be subject to significant liabilities, which could have material adverse impacts on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting

 . The tax matters agreement governs the Company s and Mural s respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes (including taxes arising in the ordinary course of business and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes), tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings, and assistance and cooperation in respect of tax matters. In connection with the Separation, the Company also entered into an employee matters agreement with Mural, dated as of November 13, 2023 (as amended, the Employee Matters Agreement ). The Employee Matters Agreement governs the Company s, Mural s and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates rights, responsibilities and obligations after the Separation with respect to employment, benefits and compensation matters relating to employees and former employees (and their respective dependents and beneficiaries) who are or were associated with the Company, including those who became employees of Mural in connection with the Separation; the allocation of assets and liabilities generally relating to employees, employment or service-related matters and employee benefit plans; other human resources, employment and employee benefits matters; and the treatment of equity-based awards granted by the Company prior to the Separation.

At September 30, 2024, the Company reviewed its investment portfolio to assess whether the unrealized losses on its available-for-sale investments were temporary. Investments with unrealized losses consisted of corporate debt securities and debt securities issued and backed by U.S. agencies and the U.S. government. At September 30, 2024 , of the Company s investment securities were in an unrealized loss position and had an aggregate estimated fair value of million. The Company s corporate debt securities investments have a minimum rating of A2 (Moody s)/A (Standard and Poor s). The primary reason for the unrealized losses in the Company s investment portfolio is that its investments are fixed-rate securities acquired in a rising interest rate environment. In making the determination whether the decline in fair value of these securities was temporary, the Company evaluated whether it intended to sell the security and whether it was more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the security before recovering its amortized cost basis. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these investments until recovery, which may be at maturity.

 million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and income tax provisions of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The income tax provisions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to taxes on income earned in Ireland. The income tax provisions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to U.S. federal and state taxes on income earned in the U.S. As of September 30, 2023, the Company maintained a valuation allowance against its Irish deferred tax assets and did not record an income tax provision in connection with the utilization of its net operating losses to offset the income earned in Ireland during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s effective tax rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was , which exceeds the Irish statutory tax rate of , primarily due to non-deductible expenses and income that was taxable at rates higher than the Irish statutory tax rate. The income tax provision recorded as of September 30, 2024 took into account the estimated impact of the global minimum tax rate component, known as Pillar Two, of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s two-pillar plan on global tax reform, which became effective in Ireland as of January 1, 2024 for multinational companies with consolidated annual revenue of at least million.

In September 2023, Acorda filed a notice of appeal of the NY Southern District Court decision to the Federal Circuit Court, and the Company filed a motion to transfer the appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In January 2024, the Federal Circuit Court denied without prejudice the Company s motion to transfer the appeal and instructed the parties to brief the jurisdictional question as part of the merits appeal.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page 5 in this Form 10-Q, and Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the audited financial statements and notes thereto accompanying our Annual Report. 
 Executive Summary 
 Net income from continuing operations was 92.8 million and 226.4 million or 0.57 and 1.36 per ordinary share basic and 0.56 and 1.33 per ordinary share diluted, for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of 91.6 million and 358.6 million or 0.55 and 2.16 per ordinary share basic and 0.53 and 2.10 per ordinary share diluted, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The increase in net income from continuing operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in product sales, net, of 41.2 million and a decrease of 18.4 million in operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease of 44.0 million in manufacturing and royalty revenue and an increase of 16.3 million in the income tax provision. The decrease in net income from continuing operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease of 256.1 million in manufacturing and royalty revenue and an increase of 42.9 million in the income tax provision, partially offset by a decrease of 56.7 million in operating expenses and an increase of 12.2 million in other income, net. The decreases in manufacturing and royalty revenues were primarily due to the receipt in June 2023 of back royalties and interest in respect of 2022 U.S. sales of the long-acting INVEGA products, following the successful outcome of the arbitration proceedings related to such products. 
 These items are discussed in greater detail later in the Results of Operations section in this Part I, Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-Q.

 ALKS 2680 
 ALKS 2680 is a novel, investigational, oral, selective orexin 2 receptor OX2R agonist in development as a once-daily treatment for narcolepsy type 1, narcolepsy type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia. Orexin, a neuropeptide produced in the lateral hypothalamus, is considered to be the master regulator of wakefulness due to its activation of multiple, downstream wake-promoting pathways that project widely throughout the brain. Targeting the orexin system may address excessive daytime sleepiness across hypersomnolence disorders, whether or not deficient orexin signaling is the underlying cause of disease. Once-daily oral administration of ALKS 2680 was previously evaluated in a phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and patients with narcolepsy type 1, narcolepsy type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia and is currently being evaluated in two phase 2 studies. Vibrance-1 in patients with narcolepsy type 1 and Vibrance-2 in patients with narcolepsy type 2. We expect to initiate Vibrance-3, a phase 2 study in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia in 2025.

VIVITROL product sales, gross, increased by 12 and 8 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to increases of 9 and 5 , respectively, in the number of units sold and a 3.2 increase in the selling price that went into effect in January 2024. ARISTADA and ARISTADA INITIO product sales, gross, increased by 4 and 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in ARISTADA and ARISTADA INITIO during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was due to an increase of 2 in the number of units sold and a 3.0 increase in the selling price that went into effect in January 2024. The increase in ARISTADA and ARISTADA INITIO during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the January 2024 increase in the selling price. LYBALVI product sales, gross, increased by 59 and 57 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to increases of 50 and 51 , respectively, in the number of units sold and increases in the selling price of 3.8 and 2.0 that went into effect in January 2024 and July 2024, respectively.

Our agreements with Janssen related to the long-acting INVEGA products provide for tiered royalty payments, which consist of a patent royalty and a know-how royalty, both of which are determined on a country-by-country basis. The patent royalty, which equals 1.5 of net sales, is payable in each country until the expiration of the last of the patents with valid claims applicable to the product in such country. The know-how royalty is a tiered royalty of 3.5 on calendar year net sales up to 250 million; 5.5 on calendar year net sales of between 250 million and 500 million; and 7.5 on calendar year net sales exceeding 500 million. The know-how royalty rate resets to 3.5 at the beginning of each calendar year and is payable until 15 years from the first commercial sale of a product in each individual country, subject to expiry of the agreement. For more information about the license agreement with Janssen in respect of the long-acting INVEGA products, see the Collaborative Arrangements Janssen section in Part I, Item 1 Business in our Annual Report. 
 
 In November 2021, we received notice from Janssen of partial termination of our license agreement under which we provided Janssen with rights to, and know-how, training and technical assistance in respect of, our NanoCrystal technology, which was used to develop the long-acting INVEGA products. The partial termination became effective in February 2022, at which time Janssen ceased paying royalties related to sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA, INVEGA TRINZA and INVEGA HAFYERA. Accordingly, we ceased recognizing royalty revenue related to sales of these products in February 2022. In April 2022, we commenced binding arbitration proceedings related to, among other things, Janssen s partial termination of this license agreement and Janssen s royalty and other obligations under the agreement. In May 2023, the Tribunal issued the Final Award, which concluded the arbitration proceedings. The Final Award provided that we were due back royalties and late-payment interest related to 2022 U.S. net sales of the long-acting INVEGA products, and are entitled to 2023 and future royalty revenues from Janssen related to net sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA through August 20, 2024, INVEGA TRINZA through the second quarter of 2030 (but no later than May 2030 when the license agreement expires) and INVEGA HAFYERA through May 2030 (when the license agreement expires). 
 
 The decrease in royalty revenues related to the long-acting INVEGA products during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the expiration of our royalty on net sales in the U.S. of INVEGA SUSTENNA on August 20, 2024. The decrease in royalty revenues related to the long-acting INVEGA products during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to the expiration of the INVEGA SUSTENNA royalty and receipt in June 2023 of back royalties of 195.4 million, inclusive of 8.1 million in late-payment interest, related to 2022 U.S. sales of the long-acting INVEGA products following the successful outcome of the arbitration proceedings described above. The decreases were partially offset by increases in royalty revenue related to worldwide net sales of the long-acting INVEGA products. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Janssen s worldwide net sales of the long-acting INVEGA products were 1,049.0 million and 3,159.0 million, respectively, as compared to 1,029.0 million and 3,104.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 We expect royalty revenues from net sales of the long-acting INVEGA products to decrease in the near-term, as the royalty revenues related to net sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA ended on August 20, 2024. In addition, each of INVEGA SUSTENNA and INVEGA TRINZA is currently subject to Paragraph IV litigation in response to companies seeking to market generic versions of such product. Increased competition from new products or generic versions of any one or more of the long-acting INVEGA products may lead to reduced unit sales of the long-acting INVEGA products, including those not yet genericized, and increased pricing pressure. For a discussion of the legal proceedings related to INVEGA TRINZA, see Note 17, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, and for information about risks relating to Paragraph IV legal proceedings, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report, and specifically the section entitled We or our licensees may face claims against IP rights covering our products and competition from generic drug manufacturers. 
 30 

The decrease in VUMERITY revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was due to a 1.0 million decrease in manufacturing revenue and a 0.9 million decrease in royalty revenue. The decrease in manufacturing revenue was primarily due to a reduction in the sales price, which was primarily due to the removal of depreciation expense from the manufacturing cost base as the assets used to manufacture VUMERITY were classified as held for sale and transferred to Novo in connection with the sale of the Athlone Facility. The decrease in royalty revenue was due to a decrease in the end-market sales of VUMERITY. The increase in VUMERITY revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due to an increase in royalty revenue of 5.3 million, due to an increase in end-market sales of VUMERITY, partially offset by a decrease in manufacturing revenue of 2.1 million, primarily due to the reduction in sales price previously discussed.

The increases in the cost of goods manufactured and sold during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily related to increases in the cost of goods sold for certain of our proprietary products due to increases in the number of units sold as discussed above, and increases in costs related to out-of-specification batches and investigation costs. These increases were partially offset by decreases in the cost of goods manufactured for certain legacy products that we manufacture, due to a decrease in volume of such products. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 For each of our R D programs, we incur both external and internal expenses. External R D expenses include fees for clinical and preclinical activities performed by contract research organizations, consulting fees, and costs related to laboratory services, the purchase of drug product materials and third-party manufacturing development activities. Internal R D expenses include employee-related expenses, occupancy costs, depreciation and general overhead. We track external R D expenses for each of our development programs; however, internal R D expenses are not tracked by individual program as they can benefit multiple development programs or our products or technologies in general. 
 The following table sets forth our external R D expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 relating to our then-current development programs and our internal R D expenses, listed by the nature of such expenses:

These amounts are not necessarily predictive of future R D expenses. In an effort to allocate our spending most effectively, we continually evaluate our products under development based on the performance of such products in preclinical and/or clinical trials, our expectations regarding the likelihood of their regulatory approval and our view of their future potential commercial viability, among other factors. 
 The increases in expenses related to ALKS 2680 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily due to increases in spend related to the advancement of the development program for the product, including completion of our phase 1b proof-of-concept study and initiation of our first two phase 2 clinical studies for the product. The increases in expenses related to LYBALVI during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily due to increased spend on the pediatric studies related to the product, partially offset by decreased spend following the completion of the long-term safety and tolerability studies for the product. The decreases in other external R D expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily due to disciplined prioritization of R D spend and activities associated with our research programs. The decreases in employee-related expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily due to a decrease in labor and benefits expense related to a 2 decrease in R D-related headcount.

The decreases in selling and marketing expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily due to decreases of 11.2 million and 21.6 million, respectively, in marketing expense and decreases of 1.7 million and 2.9 million, respectively, in employee-related expenses. The decreases in marketing expense primarily related to disciplined expense prioritization and the decreases in employee-related expenses were primarily due to decreases in salaries and benefits related to an 8 reduction in sales and marketing headcount. 
 
 The increase in general and administrative expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase of 2.0 million related to share-based compensation expense and an increase of 1.5 million related to the branded prescription drug fee. The increase in general and administrative expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase of 4.4 million in employee-related expenses due to increases in certain payroll-related taxes and in share-based compensation expense related to the vesting of certain performance-based restricted stock unit awards in February 2024, as described in Note 14, Share-based Compensation in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. These increases were partially offset by a 7.9 million decrease in professional service fees, primarily related to a decrease in legal expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 The increase in other income (expense), net, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Athlone Facility of approximately 1.5 million, following the completion of the sale in May 2024.

Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 We generated 248.7 million and 294.1 million of cash from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements, such as capital expenditures and principal and interest payments on our long-term debt, for at least the 12 months following the date from which our financial statements were issued. Subject to market conditions, interest rates and other factors, we may pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future, including debt and equity offerings, corporate collaborations, bank borrowings, arrangements relating to assets or other financing methods or structures. In addition, the 2026 Term Loans have an incremental facility capacity in an amount of 175.0 million, plus additional potential amounts, provided that we meet certain conditions, including a specified leverage ratio. 
 
 33 

Our investment objectives are, first, to preserve capital and provide sufficient liquidity to satisfy operating requirements and, second, to generate investment income. We mitigate credit risk in our cash reserves by maintaining a well-diversified portfolio that limits the amount of investment exposure as to institution, maturity, sector and investment type. Our available-for-sale investments consist primarily of short and long-term U.S. government and agency debt securities and corporate debt securities. 
 
 We classify available-for-sale investments in an unrealized loss position that do not mature within 12 months as long-term investments. We have the intent and ability to hold these investments until recovery, which may be at maturity, and it is more-likely-than-not that we would not be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost. 
 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources in the next 12 months. 
 
 In February 2024, we announced approval by our board of directors of the Repurchase Program, as described in Note 13, Shareholders Equity in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million of our ordinary shares under the Repurchase Program at a total cost of 115.3 million, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining amount authorized under the Repurchase Program was 200.0 million. 
 
 Information about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The discussion of our cash flows that follows does not include the impact of any adjustments to remove discontinued operations and is stated on a total company consolidated basis. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Operating Activities 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for non-cash operating items such as depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in our results of operations. 
 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 248.7 million and primarily consisted of net income of 220.6 million, adjusted for non-cash items including share-based compensation of 75.9 million, depreciation and amortization of 21.7 million, deferred income taxes of 32.3 million and gain on the sale of the Athlone Facility of 1.5 million, partially offset by changes in working capital of 105.1 million. 
 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 294.1 million and primarily consisted of net income of 243.0 million, adjusted for non-cash items including share-based compensation of 75.1 million and depreciation and amortization of 56.4 million, partially offset by changes in working capital of 34.3 million and deferred income taxes of 47.4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net income included receipt of 195.4 million from Janssen, inclusive of 8.1 million in late-payment interest, related to 2022 U.S. net sales of the long-acting INVEGA products following the successful outcome of the arbitration proceedings in respect of such products. 
 
 34 

Investing Activities 
 
 Cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to 172.1 million in net purchases of investments and 23.7 million in the purchase of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by proceeds related to the sale of the Athlone Facility of approximately 97.9 million, which included a payment of approximately 91.0 million for the facility and certain related assets. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to 105.4 million in net sales of investments, offset by the purchase of 31.0 million of property, plant and equipment. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to 200.0 million (exclusive of any fees, commissions or other related expenses) used to repurchase our ordinary shares under the Repurchase Program and 29.3 million of employee taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by 19.4 million of cash that we received upon exercises of employee stock options. Cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to 26.1 million of employee taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by 15.1 million of cash that we received upon exercises of employee stock options. 
 
 Debt 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the principal balance of our borrowings consisted of 289.5 million outstanding under our 2026 Term Loans. See Note 12, Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for further discussion of our 2026 Term Loans. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or using different assumptions. 
 
 See the Critical Accounting Estimates section in Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report for a discussion of our critical accounting estimates. 
 
 New Accounting Standards 
 
 See the New Accounting Pronouncements section in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for discussion of certain recent accounting standards applicable to us. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risks related to our investment portfolio, and the ways we manage such risks, are summarized in Part II, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report. We regularly review our marketable securities holdings and shift our investment holdings to those that best meet our investment objectives, which are to preserve capital, provide sufficient liquidity to satisfy operating requirements and generate investment income. Apart from such adjustments to our investment portfolio, there have been no material changes to our market risks since December 31, 2023, and we do not anticipate any near-term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in our management s objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures. 
 We are exposed to non-U.S. currency exchange risk related to manufacturing and royalty revenues that we receive on certain of our products, partially offset by certain operating costs arising from expenses and payables in connection with our Irish operations that are settled predominantly in Euro. These non-U.S. currency exchange rate risks are summarized in Part II, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report. 
 35 

There has been no material change in our assessment of our sensitivity to non-U.S. currency exchange rate risk since December 31, 2023. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and interim principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and interim principal financial officer each concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and interim principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 b) Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The specific timing and amounts of repurchases under the Repurchase Program will depend on a variety of factors, including but not limited to ongoing assessments of our needs, alternative investment opportunities, the market price of our ordinary shares and general market conditions.
