 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 For the Three and Nine Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 of the outstanding equity of Bressner Technology GmbH, a limited liability company registered under the laws of Germany and located near Munich, Germany Bressner ). Bressner designs and manufactures standard and customized servers, panel PCs, and PCIe accelerator systems. It also operates as a systems integrator with standard and custom all in one hardware systems and components. In addition, Bressner serves as a channel to market for OSS ruggedized datacenter level compute and storage products to the European and Middle Eastern markets. The Company completed and fulfilled all remaining orders associated with its long-term media and entertainment customer during the year ended December 31, 2023, and does not anticipate further business from this customer in the future. This resulted from an acceleration in the customer s investment in cloud technology and a drive towards less intelligent compute capability at the edge to reduce the costs of their componentry. This customer s transition to cloud solutions had a negative impact on the Company s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. With the Company's shift in focus to the development and sale of AI Transportables, we have significantly increased our efforts to penetrate the military and defense sectors. With the hiring of Michael Knowles and Robert Kalebaugh in mid-2023, each of whom has extensive experience in contracting in the defense industry, as our new president and chief executive officer, and vice president of sales, respectively, we further increased our emphasis and focus on the pursuit of revenue opportunities with major defense contractors and the military. We have also added relevant defense market experience to our board of directors through the appointment of Mr. Knowles, Vice Admiral Dumont and Mitch Herbets as directors. The negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the geopolitical instability caused in part by the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, have contributed to economic uncertainty. Component shortages and increased lead times on materials sourced from Taiwan, coupled with rising political tensions in Taiwan, resulted in supply chain delays and shortages that negatively impacted the Bressner business during the most recent quarter. With the recent decrease in interest rates, economists now are anticipating a soft landing for both the U.S. and in Germany. Additionally, it is possible that U.S. policy changes and

as a result of our increased emphasis and focus on the pursuit of revenue opportunities with major defense contractors and the military. The Company recently reviewed its existing pipeline and has made adjustments to reflect the procurement habits and timing of the military and defense sector in an effort to avoid similar inventory valuation charges in the future. These global issues and concerns are impacting our business as well as some of our customers, who are continuing to experience downturns or uncertainty in their own business operations and revenue, and as a result, these customers may need to decrease or delay their technology spending, request pricing concessions or payment extensions, or seek to renegotiate their contracts. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company experienced delays in orders due to certain customers funding or program delays. If such decreases in orders or postponements continue in the future, or we experience cancellations of orders, our operating results will be further impacted, and our revenues may decline in future periods. These global issues and events may also have the effect of heightening many risks associated with our customers and supply chain. We may take further actions that alter our operations from time to time, or which we determine are in our best interests. In addition, we may decide to postpone or abandon planned investments in our business in response to changes in our business, which may impact our ability to attract and retain customers and our rate of innovation, either of which could harm our business. As a result of these global issues, as well as other factors discussed in these notes, it has been difficult to accurately forecast our revenues or financial results. In addition, while the potential impact and duration of these issues on the economy and our business may be difficult to assess or predict, these world events have resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, and may reduce our ability to access additional capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity in the future. Our results of operations could be materially below our forecasts as well, which could adversely affect our results of operations, disappoint analysts and investors, or cause our stock price to decline. Management s plans with respect to the above are to continue their efforts towards responding to the changing economic landscape, to continue to control costs, conserve cash, strengthen margins through the introduction of new product lines focusing on AI compute capabilities for military and industrial applications, autonomous truck driving and improve company-wide execution through increased investments in product marketing.

, which was charged to operating expenses in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Due to the Ukraine war, the continuing conflicts between Israel and Hamas, inflationary pressures, other macroeconomic factors and the loss of our previous media and entertainment customer, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy, financial markets and our ongoing operations. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or assumptions or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of this Quarterly Report. These estimates and assumptions may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. As a result, actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions.

Cash alternatives represent cash balances in savings accounts and U.S. Treasury Bills that are temporarily on-hand that are immediately available for investments in accordance with the Company s investment policy. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities and its investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any issuer. The policy requires investments in fixed income instruments denominated and payable in U.S. dollars only and requires investments to be investment grade, with a primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.

The amendment did not increase the total number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan and did not require stockholder approval. On May 19, 2021, the Company s stockholders approved the Company s proposal to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan from shares to shares of common stock of the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 2017 Plan. The amendment took effect upon receipt of stockholder approval. On March 15, 2024, the Company s board of directors unanimously approved, and on May 15, 2024, the Company s stockholders approved, an amendment to the 2017 Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance thereunder from to shares.

If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested awards, the Company may be required to accelerate, increase, or cancel any remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense or calculate and record additional expense. Future stock-based compensation expense and unearned stock-based compensation will increase to the extent that the Company grants additional common stock options or other stock-based awards. Restricted Stock Units RSUs may be granted at the discretion of the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors under the 2017 Plan in connection with the hiring and retention of personnel and are subject to certain conditions. RSUs generally vest quarterly or semi-annually over a period of one to and are typically forfeited if employment is terminated before the RSUs vest. The compensation expense related to the RSUs is calculated as the fair value of the common stock on the grant date and is amortized to expense over the vesting period and is adjusted for estimated forfeitures.

This discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements based upon current beliefs, plans and expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors or in other parts of this Quarterly Report. In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the information set forth under the heading Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024.

 Overview 
 
 The Company designs, manufactures, and markets specialized high-performance compute, high speed switch fabrics and storage hardware and software, which are designed to target edge Artificial Intelligence ("AI") Transportable deployments. Edge computing is a form of computing that is done on site, near a particular data source or the user, rather than in the cloud, minimizing the need for data to be processed in a remote datacenter. This growing trend increases computing performance and security, as the data does not have to travel to a distant datacenter location. Edge computing is most recognizable in applications such as sensor processing, sensor fusion, autonomy and AI/machine learning ("ML"). To meet the demands at the edge, we offer specialized modules and systems that consist of computers, switch fabrics and storage products that incorporate the latest state-of-the art components with embedded proprietary software. Such modules and systems allow us to offer high-end solutions to target markets to be integrated into, platforms, vehicles and applications. 
 
 The global increase in load on the cloud infrastructure and increase in AI applications are the primary factors driving the growth of the edge computing market. We market our products to manufacturers of automated equipment used for medical, industrial, and military applications. Our customer applications often require connection to a wide array of data sources and sensors, ultra-fast processing power, and the ability to quickly access and store large and ever-growing data sets at their physical location (rather than in the cloud). This equipment requires datacenter class performance optimized for deployment at the edge in challenging environments. Many of these edge applications have unique requirements, including special and compact form factors ruggedized for harsh conditions, which cannot be accommodated by traditional controlled air-conditioned datacenters. 
 
 We believe that we are uniquely positioned as a specialized provider to address the needs of this market, providing custom servers, data acquisition platforms, compute accelerators, solid-state storage arrays, system I/O expansion systems, as well as edge optimized industrial and panel PCs, tablets, and handheld compute devices. Our systems also offer industry leading capabilities that occupy less physical space and require less power consumption. We deliver this high-end technology to our customers through the sale of equipment and embedded software. 
 
 One Stop Systems, Inc. was originally incorporated as a California corporation in 1999, after initially being formed as a California limited liability company in 1998. On December 14, 2017, the Company was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in connection with its initial public offering. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary in Germany, OSS GmbH. Then, in July 2016, the Company acquired Magma and its operations that complemented OSS' manufacture of custom high-performance compute servers. 
 
 On August 31, 2018, the Company acquired Concept Development, Inc. ("CDI"), which was located in Irvine, California. CDI specialized in the design and manufacture of custom high-performance computing systems for airborne in-flight entertainment, flight safety equipment, and networking systems. CDI s business was fully integrated into the core operations of OSS as of June 1, 2020. 
 
 On October 31, 2018, OSS GmbH acquired 100 of the outstanding equity of Bressner Technology GmbH, a Germany limited liability company located near Munich, Germany ("Bressner"). Bressner designs and manufactures standard and customized servers, panel PCs, and PCIe expansion systems. Bressner also provides

 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 
 The Company recognizes revenue under accounting standard ASC 606. Revenue is primarily generated from the sale of computer hardware and engineering services, and, to a minimal extent, revenue is also generated from the sale of software and sales of software maintenance and support contracts. The Company s performance obligations are satisfied over time as work is performed or at a point in time. The majority of the Company s revenue is recognized at a point in time when products ship and control is deemed to be transferred to the customer. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. 
 27 

Cost of revenue 
 Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs of materials, costs paid to third-party contract manufacturers (which may include the costs of components), and personnel costs associated with manufacturing and support operations. Personnel costs consist of wages, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation expenses. The cost of revenue also includes freight, allocated overhead costs and inventory write-offs and changes to our inventory and warranty reserves. Allocated overhead costs consist of certain facilities and utility costs. We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars with product revenue increases. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of general and administrative, sales and marketing and research and development expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense are the most significant components of each category of operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities and utility costs. 
 General and Administrative - General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses for administrative functions including finance, legal, human resources, and fees for third-party professional services, as well as allocated overhead. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in growing the business. 
 
 Impairment of goodwill - Impairment of goodwill consists of the amount of write down of value attributable to acquisitions of the amount paid that was in excess of the book value of the assets acquired. 
 Marketing and Selling Marketing and selling expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, travel, and entertainment expenses as well as allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, tradeshows, events, corporate communications, and brand-building activities. We expect marketing and selling expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales force, increase marketing resources, and further develop sales channels. 
 Research and Development - Research and development expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, prototype expenses, depreciation associated with assets acquired for research and development, third-party engineering, and contractor support costs, as well as allocated overhead. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in new and existing products. 
 Other Income (Expense), net 
 Other income consists of miscellaneous income and income received from activities outside of our core business. Other expense includes expenses from activities outside of our core business. 
 
 Employee Retention Credit is a one-time U.S. government benefit enacted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") to provide certain relief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes a provision for an Employee Retention Credit ERC ). The ERC was designed to encourage businesses to keep employees on the payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes

Revenue 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our total revenue decreased 47,066, or 0.3 , as compared to the same period in 2023. OSS saw an increase in revenue of 960,131, or 17.5 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The primary contributor to this increase were initial shipments on a government contract for a mobile application. Bressner experienced a decrease of 1,007,197, or 12.2 , as compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of economic constraints in the marketplace. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total revenue decreased 8,187,376, or 17.2 , as compared to the same period in 2023. OSS saw a decrease in revenue of 4,892,645, or 21.8 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The primary contributor to this reduction is a reduction of approximately 4.8 million in sales to a former media and entertainment customer with which we no longer have as a customer. This relationship was terminated in the second quarter of the prior year. Bressner experienced a decrease of 3,294,731, or 13.0 , as compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of a slowdown in the economy in Germany. 
 
 Cost of revenue and gross (loss) profit 
 
 Cost of revenue increased 5,322,023, or 52.70 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. OSS saw an increase in cost of revenue of 6,053,855, or 162.9 , as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase in cost of revenue is mainly attributable to an additional allowance for inventory obsolescence of 6,099,259. Bressner s cost of revenue decreased 731,832, or 11.5 , as compared to the same period in 2023, due to reduced overall sales due to a difficult economy. 
 
 The overall gross margin percentage was negative 12.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and on an adjusted basis 32.0 after backing out the impact of the adjustment for the write down of inventory of 6,099,259. OSS gross margin percentage for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was negative 51.2 , a reduction of 83.6 percentage points as compared to the prior year period in 2023 of 32.4 , due to an additional inventory allowance charge of 6,099,259 for obsolescence. Excluding this obsolescence charge to cost of revenue, the gross margin would have been 43.2 as compared to that of the prior year period in 2023 of 32.4 . Bressner contributed gross margin at a rate of 22.0 , as compared to the same period in 2023 of 22.6 , a decrease of 0.6 percentage points, due to product mix as compared to the same 2024 period and an additional inventory reserve of 122,530. 
 
 Cost of revenue decreased 6,143, or 0.02 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. OSS saw an increase in cost of revenue of 2,475,235, or 16.4 , as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase in cost of revenue is mainly attributable to a significant increase in the reserve for obsolete inventory for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 of 5,841,644 as compared to the prior year. Bressner s cost of revenue decreased 2,481,378, or 13.0 , as compared to the same period in 2023, due to reduced overall sales due to a difficult economy and a reduction of additional sales attributable to project based related business. 
 
 The overall gross margin percentage was 13.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or 28.9 , after backing out the impact of the adjustment for the write down of inventory of 6,099,259. OSS gross margin percentage for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was negative 0.2 , a reduction of 32.9 percentage points as compared to the prior year period in 2023 of 32.7 , due to the additional charge for obsolescence. Excluding the obsolescence charge to cost of revenue, the gross margin on an adjusted basis would have been 34.6 as compared to that of the prior year period in 2023 of 32.7 . Bressner contributed gross margin at a rate of 24.4 , as compared to the same period in 2023 of 24.4 , consistent with the prior year. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 
 General and administrative expense 
 
 General and administrative expense increased 121,372, or 6.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. OSS experienced an increase of 167,361, or 11.5 . The increase in general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to increased salaries and stock compensation expense. Bressner had a decrease of 45,989, or 9.6 , as a result of an organization realignment. Overall, total general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenue to 15 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 14.1 during the same period in 2023. 
 31 

General and administrative expense decreased 734,894, or 10.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. OSS experienced a decrease of 546,065, or 9.3 . The decrease in general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to the elimination of costs associated with our organizational restructuring and outside professional services in 2023. Bressner had a decrease of 188,829, or 13.3 , as a result of an organization realignment. Overall, total general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenue to 16.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 15.3 during the same period in 2023. 
 
 Impairment of goodwill 
 
 During September 2023, the Company took an additional write-down of 2,930,788 as a result of the overall financial performance of OSS as compared to plan, the transition of and focus on our product strategy on AI Transportables and the defense industry deferment of certain orders. Total goodwill impairment loss for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 was 5,630,788. There was no such impairment charge in 2024. 
 
 Marketing and selling expense 
 
 Marketing and selling expense increased 295,719, or 17.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. OSS had an increase of 149,132, or 11.5 , due to an increase in tradeshows and personnel. Bressner had an increase of 146,587, or 35.1 , primarily resulting from the addition of new marketing and program management personnel and sales collateral material. Overall, total marketing and selling expense increased as a percentage of revenue to 14.7 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 12.5 during the same period in 2023. 
 
 Marketing and selling expense increased 1,200,314, or 24.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. OSS had an increase of 657,733, or 17.6 , due to an increase in tradeshows and personnel. Bressner had an increase of 542,581, or 43.6 , primarily resulting from the addition of new marketing and program management personnel and sales collateral material. Overall, total marketing and selling expense increased as a percentage of revenue to 15.6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 10.4 during the same period in 2023. 
 
 Research and development expense 
 
 Research and development expense decreased 103,479, or 9.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. OSS saw a decrease of 125,511, or 13.7 . The decrease was largely driven by engineering resources being deployed on chargeable projects, which costs are reclassified as a component of costs of sales. Bressner experienced an increase of 22,032, or 16.3 , due to additional personnel and overhead costs. Overall, total research and development expense as a percentage of revenue decreased as a percentage of revenue to 6.9 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7.7 during the same period in 2023. 
 
 Research and development expense decreased 356,978, or 11.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. OSS saw a decrease of 444,078, or 15.7 . The decrease was largely driven by engineering resources being deployed on chargeable projects, which costs are reclassified as a component of costs of sales. Bressner experienced an increase of 87,100, or 23.4 , due to additional personnel and overhead costs. Overall, total research and development expense as a percentage of revenue increased as a percentage of revenue to 7.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6.7 during the same period in 2023. 
 
 Interest income 
 
 Interest income decreased 53,824 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is attributable to lower investment balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. 
 
 Interest income decreased 8,531 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is attributable to lower investment balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. 
 
 32 

Interest expense 
 
 Interest expense decreased 15,003 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023 due to declining borrowing balances. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 17,202 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023 due to declining borrowing balances. 
 
 Employee Retention Credit 
 
 For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023, the Company received a government provided ERC for the retention of employees during the COVID-19 pandemic during the years of 2020 and 2021, in the amount of 488,348 less commissions of 69,862 and 2,004,382 less commission of 287,655, respectively. 
 
 Other income (expense), net 
 
 Other income (expense), for the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulted in net other expense of 14,402 as compared to net other income of 13,035, in the same period in 2023, for a net decrease in other income of 27,437 attributable to changes in foreign currency gain and losses. 
 
 Other income (expense), for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted in net other income of 14,707 as compared to net other income of 24,649, in the same period in 2023, for a net increase in other income of 9,942 attributable to gains on foreign currency transactions. 
 
 Provision for income taxes 
 
 We have recorded an income tax provision of 167,086 and 226,967, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and 569,382 and 885,332, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, differed from the statutory rate mainly due to permanent non-deductible goodwill amortization for Bressner, change in valuation allowance, deductions related to expenses of OSS stock options, research and development credits, and changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions, as well as projecting foreign and state tax liabilities for the year. The tax provision is predominately attributable to profit on operations in Germany. 
 
 Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, research and development costs are no longer fully deductible and are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes effective January 1, 2022. The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance and may have an impact on payment of tax liabilities. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 29.4 , as compared to 28.5 in the prior period in 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been provided by public and private offerings of our securities and revenues generated from our business operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had total cash and cash equivalents of 9,402,608, with short-term investments of 3,180,213, and total working capital of 26,676,256. Cash and cash equivalents held by Bressner totaled US 3,196,163 on September 30, 2024. Bressner s debt covenants do not permit the use of those funds by its parent company. 
 
 During the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, we had a loss from operations of 10,250,905, with cash provided by operating activities of 2,143,545. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we had a loss from operations of 7,923,135, with cash used by operating activities of 439,679. 
 
 Our sources of liquidity and cash flows are used to fund ongoing operations, fund research and development projects for new products technologies and provide ongoing support services for our customers. Over the next year, we anticipate that we will use our liquidity and cash flows from our operations to fund our business. We cannot provide assurances that additional financing will be available to us at any required time and on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 
 33 

As of September 30, 2024, economists are suggesting that the economy is beginning to improve and will result in a soft landing. We intend to continue to monitor the effects of inflation, global supply chain shortages and the economic conditions, and, if appropriate, we may alter our plans to address such concerns as they may arise. 
 
 Management s plans are to focus on acquiring new customer orders to replace lost revenue attributable to our previous media customer, to continue our efforts towards responding to the changing economic landscape, including significant inflation, both domestically and internationally, foreign currency exchange rates, a potential recession in the U.S. and/or Germany, the high Federal Reserve and European Central Bank interest rates, supply chain constraints and international conflicts, by continuing to control hiring and operating costs, conserve cash, and continual focus on improving margin. 
 
 Management expects these actions and continued diligence towards limiting cost growth and expense containment will provide long-term sustainability. Management is also committed to conserving cash and securing debt and/or equity financing, as required, for liquidity to meet our cash requirements through at least the next twelve months. 
 
 In April 2022, the Company obtained a domestic revolving line of credit of 2,000,000 from its bank, which was renewed in September 2024 and will expire in September 2026 at the current prime rate. To access this line of credit, the Company must maintain a minimum cash balance of 2,500,000 with the bank and maintain a maximum debt to tangible net worth of ratio of 1.00 to 1.00. The line of credit is also collateralized by the assets of the Company. No balance was outstanding on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Although the Company has not drawn down on the line of credit to date, it may choose to do so in the future. 
 
 Additionally, in August 2023, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-274073) with the SEC, which became effective on August 25, 2023, and allows us to offer and sell up to an aggregate of 100,000,000 of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants to purchase our common stock, preferred stock or debt securities, subscription rights to purchase our common stock, preferred stock or debt securities and/or units consisting of some or all of these securities, in any combination, together or separately, in one or more offerings, in amounts, at prices and on the terms that we will determine at the time of the offering and which will be set forth in a prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus. In the event that we need additional financing, we may choose to consummate an offering of our securities under the registration statement on S-3 in order to raise capital. 
 
 As a result of management s commitment to controlling costs, conserving cash, and our potential sources of liquidity, as well as management s most recent cash flow forecasts, management believes that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our anticipated working capital requirements for our ongoing operations and obligations for at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that management s efforts will be effective or the forecasted cash flows will be achieved. Furthermore, we will continue to evaluate our capital expenditure needs based upon various factors, including but not limited to, our sales from operations, growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts, the timing of new product introductions, and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services. 
 
 If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may borrow up to 2,000,000 from our revolving line of credit with our bank (subject to satisfaction of certain borrowing conditions), may have to sell additional equity or debt securities, or may obtain expanded credit facilities to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, diversify our geographical reach, and grow the Company. In the event such financing is needed in the future, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us, or, if available, that it will be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected. However, if cash flows from operations become insufficient to continue operations at the current level, and if no additional financing were obtained, then management would consider restructuring the Company in a way to preserve its business while maintaining expenses within operating cash flows.

Operating Activities 
 
 During the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, we generated 2,143,545 in cash from operating activities, an increase of 1,918,076 when compared to the cash provided by operating activities of 225,469 during the same period in 2023. 
 
 The change in cash provided by operating activities during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, is primarily a result of three components comprised of (i) an increase in net loss of 4,060,935 to 10,499,551 in the current year period, from a net loss of 6,438,616 in the prior year period; (ii) net favorable adjustments in the current period for non-cash items of 471,748, which were comprised of 8,187,318 of favorable non-cash items, offset by 7,715,570 of negative non-cash items that did not affect operating cash flow; and (iii) cash provided by changes in working capital items of 5,507,263. 
 
 Cash provided by changes in working capital for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, was 3,296,266 as compared to the prior year period uses in working capital of 2,210,997. The net change in cash provided by changes in working capital items during the comparative periods was 5,507,263. 
 
 Our ability to generate cash from operations in future periods will depend in large part on our profitability, the rate and timing of collections of our accounts receivable, our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital, including accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated cash of 4,293,263 from investing activities, as compared to 298,401 provided by investing activities during the prior year period in 2023, a net increase of 3,994,862. This change is attributable to an increase in the number of short-term investments redeemed in the current period as compared to the prior period. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Given the current economic, financial, and geopolitical instability, the Company believes it is imperative to maintain opportunities for additional financial resources to ensure financial stability during trying economic times. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company used 1,144,189 in cash for debt service payments on Bressner borrowings and payment of tax on the net exercise of vested RSUs, while generating 237,748 from the exercise of options. During the same period in 2023, the Company generated 135,403 from comparable items, for a difference of 1,279,592 in the current period as compared to the prior period. 
 Known Trends or Uncertainties 
 
 Although we have not seen any significant reduction in revenues to date due to consolidations, we have seen some consolidation in our industry. These consolidations have not had a negative effect on our total sales; however, should consolidations and downsizing in the industry continue to occur, those events could adversely impact our revenues and earnings going forward. 
 
 We are continuing to experience delays in funding for customer projects, delays in delivery schedules based upon customer requirements and an extended sales cycle. Additionally, certain of our customers are experiencing downturns or uncertainty in their own business operations and revenue, including one customer that declared 
 35 

bankruptcy in 2023, and as a result there is an increased risk that these customers may need to decrease or delay their technology spending, request pricing concessions or payment extensions, or seek to renegotiate their contracts. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company experienced delays and postponements of purchases and orders due to certain customers funding or program delays. We have also experienced cancellations of orders due to disruptions in our customers businesses or changes in their business plans. Such delays, postponements and cancellations could negatively impact the Company s results of operations for the year ending December 31, 2024. If such decreases in orders, postponements or cancellations continue in the future, our operating results will be further impacted, and our revenues may decline in future periods. 
 
 With the Company's shifted focus to the development and sale of AI Transportables, we have significantly increased our efforts to penetrate the military and defense sectors, which typically have protracted sales cycles, significant contracting requirements, and multi-year deliverables. With the hiring of a new president and chief executive officer and new vice president of sales in mid-2023, as well as a new chief financial officer effective as of November 11, 2024, each of whom has extensive experience in contracting in the defense industry, we have further increased our emphasis and focus on the pursuit of revenue opportunities with major defense contractors and the military. We have recently reviewed our existing pipeline and have made adjustments to reflect the procurement habits and timing of the military and defense sector. We have also added relevant defense market experience to our board of directors through the appointment of Mr. Knowles, Vice Admiral Dumont and Mitch Herbets as directors. We believe that these changes will allow us to further penetrate the defense sector and enhance our business strategies with respect to this target market. 
 
 The world continues to be affected by the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East and economic uncertainty, amongst other things. Component shortages and increased lead times on materials sourced from Taiwan, coupled with rising political tensions in Taiwan, resulted in supply chain delays and shortages that negatively impacted the Bressner business during the most recent quarter, and could continue to negatively impact our business in the near term. Additionally, it is possible that U.S. policy changes and uncertainty about such changes, including changes and uncertainty as a result of the upcoming U.S. presidential election, could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations. These factors, amongst other things, could result in further economic uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets in the near term, and could negatively affect our operations. 
 
 We believe that the need for improved productivity in the research and development activities directed toward developing new products and/or software will continue to result in increasing adoption of high-performance computers and interconnect technologies such as those we produce. New product and/or software developments in the specialized compute-business segment could result in increased revenues and earnings if they are accepted by our markets; however, there can be no assurances that new products and/or software will result in significant improvements to revenues or earnings. For competitive reasons, we do not disclose all our new product development activities. 
 
 Additionally, the potential for growth in new markets is uncertain. We will continue to explore these opportunities until such time as we either generate sales or determine that resources would be more efficiently used elsewhere. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 We have recently experienced some and, continue to feel, the effects due to inflation in both the U.S. and Europe. Although the Company attempts to pass on increases in raw material, labor, energy and fuel-related costs to our customers, the Company s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the Company s products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered. These increasing costs are being aggressively managed by the Company and actions are being taken to minimize the impact to the 
 36 

Company, particularly in the purchase of inventories to minimize price increases. Inflation affects the Company s manufacturing costs, distribution costs and operating expenses. 
 
 Off balance sheet arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. 
 We do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not consolidated in the financial statements. Additionally, we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any special purpose entities. 
 Stockholder transactions 
 See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding our stockholder transactions for the relevant periods. 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates 
 In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management must make a variety of decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. These decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In making these decisions, management applies its judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and our historical experience. 
 Our accounting policies and estimates that are most critical to the presentation of our results of operations and financial condition, and which require the greatest use of judgments and estimates by management, are designated as our critical accounting policies. See further discussion of our critical accounting policies under Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 On November 27, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to reportable segment disclosures." This amendment enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. The purpose of the amendments is to enable investors to better understand an entity s overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. The adoption of this amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We do not anticipate any material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Interest rate risk 
 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk is primarily associated with borrowing on revolving lines of credit denominated in both U.S. dollars and Euros. We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities for our variable rate borrowings. Both the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have increased interest rates from historic levels over the last two years. Although the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September 2024, the current rate remains higher than historical rates and there can be no assurances that further cuts will be made in the near term. 

Concentration of credit risk 
 
 At times, deposits held with financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and Securities Investor Protection Corporation SIPC ), both of which provide basic deposit coverage with limits up to 250,000 per owner. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 2,785,706 of cash in our accounts that exceeded the insurance limits. The Company has not experienced any losses 
 37 

in these accounts and believes that the financial institutions at which such amounts are held are stable; however, no assurances can be provided. In Germany, the deposit insurance is 100,000 per bank, per customer. Bressner has funds on deposit in both Euro and U.S. dollar denominations of 2,457,160 (US 2,737,991) with banks in excess of the insurance limits. 
 
 We provide credit to our customers in the normal course of business. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary. 
 
 Foreign currency risk 
 
 We operate in the United States and Germany. Our primary reporting currency is the United States dollar. Foreign sales of products and services are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We also conduct business outside the United States through Bressner, our foreign subsidiary in Germany, where business is largely transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies, particularly the Euro, which is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Accordingly, we are subject to exposure from changes in the exchange rates of local currencies. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 OSS GmbH operates as an extension of OSS domestic operations and acquired Bressner in October 2018. The functional currency of OSS GmbH is the Euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured in the functional currency at the average exchange rate in effect during the period. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Consequently, changes in the exchange rates of the currencies may impact the translation of the foreign subsidiaries statements of operations into U.S. dollars, which may in turn affect our consolidated statement of operations. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
 
 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 We employ derivatives on a periodic basis to manage certain market risks through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Our derivatives are designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). We hedge a portion of the exchange risk involved in anticipation of highly probable foreign currency-denominated transactions. In anticipation of these transactions, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to provide currency at a fixed rate. The Company is currently not a party to any of these types of transactions. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We believe that the use of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, is helpful for an investor to assess the performance of the Company. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, acquisition expenses, impairment of long-lived assets, financing costs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation expense and expenses related to discontinued operations. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company s non-cash operating expenses, we believe that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash and non-recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between our core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing us with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own core business operating results over different periods of time. 
 38 

Our adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. Our adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not consider adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.

Adjusted EPS 
 Adjusted EPS excludes the impact of certain items, and therefore, has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that exclusion of certain selected items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying results and trends and allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry. We use this measure along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. The Company defines non-GAAP income (loss) as income or (loss) before amortization, stock-based compensation, expenses related to discontinued operations, impairment of long-lived assets and non-recurring acquisition costs. Adjusted EPS expresses adjusted income (loss) on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
 
 Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted EPS financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.

Free Cash Flow 
 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure for reporting cash flow, is defined as cash provided by or used in operating activities, less capital expenditures for property and equipment, which includes capitalized software development costs for the implementation of the Company s ERP system. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on cash available for investments and acquisitions after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long-term value creation. We believe that trends in our free cash flow can be valuable indicators of our operating performance and liquidity. 
 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 We expect to continue to incur expenditures similar to the free cash flow adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these expenditures reflect all of our obligations which require cash. The following table reconciles cash provided by or used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow:

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Not Applicable. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls 
 The design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals. The inherent limitations in any control system include the realities that judgments related to decision-making can be faulty, and that reduced effectiveness in controls can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Due to the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error may occur and may not be detected. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management is required to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on our management s evaluation (based upon 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company modified and improved the process and procedures surrounding the authorization for the purchasing of inventory through creation of a weekly Sales Operational Planning meeting ("S OP") to rationalize future purchases of inventory consistent with our revenue pipeline. In addition, we have increased the scrutiny, and improved the process and procedures to include more input from multiple departments with respect to the identification of obsolete and slow-moving inventory to improve our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The foregoing matters, which were identified in connection with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
