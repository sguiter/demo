A summary of our financial results is as follows: Net sales decreased by 8.1 over the prior year third quarter to 127.1 million, and net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 decreased by 3.9 over the first nine months of the prior year to 385.4 million; Net loss of 28.5 million in fiscal 2024 third quarter compared to the prior year third quarter net loss of 10.5 million, and net loss in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 of 40.1 million compared to a net loss in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 of 16.4 million; and Adjusted EBITDA decreased to 6.8) million in fiscal 2024 third quarter compared to the prior year third quarter Adjusted EBITDA of 1.6) million, and adjusted EBITDA in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 of 5.7 million compared to 12.3 million over the first nine months of fiscal 2023. See the Reconciliation of Net Loss to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA section for a reconciliation of our net loss to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA, both of which are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. See also the information under the heading Adjusted EBITDA in the section How We Assess the Performance of Our Business for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Our management s discussion and analysis includes market sales metrics for our stores, website and catalog sales. Market areas are determined by a third-party that divides the United States and Puerto Rico into 280 unique geographical areas. Our store market sales metrics include sales from our stores, website and catalog. Our non-store market sales metrics include sales from our website and catalog. Economic Conditions The macroeconomic environment is experiencing inflation, recessionary concerns and general uncertainty regarding the future economic environment and therefore we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these economic conditions on our operational and financial performance. Given the uncertainty, we cannot reasonably estimate store traffic patterns and the prolonged impact on overall consumer demand. How We Assess the Performance of Our Business In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and operating measures that affect our operating results. Net Sales Net sales reflect our sale of merchandise plus shipping and handling revenue collected from our customers, less returns and discounts. Direct-to-consumer sales are recognized upon shipment of the product and store sales are recognized at the point of sale.

Gross Profit Gross profit is equal to our net sales less cost of goods sold. Gross profit as a percentage of our net sales is referred to as gross margin. Cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise; inventory shrinkage; inventory adjustments due to obsolescence, including excess and slow-moving inventory and lower of cost and net realizable reserves; inbound freight; and freight from our distribution centers to our retail stores. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are raw material costs. Depreciation and amortization are excluded from gross profit. We expect gross profit to increase to the extent that we successfully grow our net sales. Our gross profit may not be comparable to other retailers, as we do not include distribution network and store occupancy expenses in calculating gross profit, but instead we include them in selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs not included in cost of goods sold. These expenses include all payroll and payroll-related expenses and occupancy expenses related to our stores and to our operations at our headquarters, including utilities, depreciation and amortization and distribution network expenses. They also include marketing expense, which primarily includes digital and television advertising, catalog production, mailing and print advertising costs, as well as all logistics costs associated with shipping product to our customers, consulting and software expenses and professional services fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is usually higher in lower-volume quarters and lower in higher-volume quarters because a portion of the costs are relatively fixed. Adjusted EBITDA We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of operating performance, as it provides a clearer picture of operating results by excluding the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest and depreciation costs and eliminating expenses that are not reflective of underlying business performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense and provision for income taxes adjusted for the impact of certain items, including non-cash, restructuring expenses and other items we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation, amortization and other items. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as one of the key financial metrics in determining bonus compensation for our employees. This non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Results of Operations The following table summarizes our unaudited consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales.

 Three Months Ended October 27, 2024 , Compared to Three Months Ended October 29, 2023 Net Sales Net sales decreased 11.2 million, or 8.1 , to 127.1 million in the three months ended October 27, 2024 compared to 138.2 million in the three months ended October 29, 2023. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by lower web conversion and a decline in store traffic. Store market net sales decreased 7.9 million, or 9.3 , to 88.7 million in the three months ended October 27, 2024 compared to 96.6 million in the three months ended October 29, 2023. Non-store market net sales decreased by 3.7 million, or 9.8 , to 37.1 million in the three months ended October 27, 2024 compared to 40.8 million in the three months ended October 29, 2023. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased 3.0 million, or 4.3 , to 66.4 million in the three months ended October 27, 2024 compared to 69.4 million in the three months ended October 29, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased to 52.3 of net sales in the three months ended October 27, 2024, compared to 50.2 of net sales in the three months ended October 29, 2023. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by our sourcing initiatives. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1.0 million, or 1.2 , to 82.9 million in the three months ended October 27, 2024 compared to 81.8 million in the three months ended October 29, 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 65.2 in the three months ended October 27, 2024, compared to 59.2 in the three months ended October 29, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was mainly driven by increased advertising spend, partially offset by optimization in our outbound shipping network. Income Taxes Income tax expense was 4.7 million in the three months ended October 27, 2024, compared to income tax benefit of 3.1 million in the three months ended October 29, 2023. The provision for third quarter of fiscal 2024 reflected the establishment of a valuation allowance of 10.1 million established against the net amount of deferred tax assets as well as pre-tax loss in the current year. Net Loss Attributable to Controlling Interest Net loss attributable to controlling interest was 28.5 million, in the three months ended October 27, 2024 compared to net loss of 10.5 million in the three months ended October 29, 2023. In addition to the factors addressed above, 6.2 million in restructuring expense contributed to the net loss in the current period.

The decrease was driven by slower store traffic compared to the prior year. Non-store market net sales decreased by 6.0 million, or 5.1 , to 112.8 million in the nine months ended October 27, 2024 compared to 118.8 million in the nine months ended October 29, 2023 . Gross Profit Gross profit decreased 4.5 million, or 2.2 , to 202.0 million in the nine months ended October 27, 2024 compared to 206.5 million in the nine months ended October 29, 2023 . As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased to 52.4 of net sales in the nine months ended October 27, 2024, compared to 51.5 of net sales in the nine months ended October 29, 2023 . The increase in gross margin rate was primarily driven by our sourcing initiatives. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.8 million, or 2.1 , to 229.7 million in the nine months ended October 27, 2024 compared to 224.9 million in the nine months ended October 29, 2023 . Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 59.6 in the nine months ended October 27, 2024, compared to 56.1 in the nine months ended October 29, 2023 . The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses included a 2.4 million non-recurring estimated sales tax expense. Excluding this non-recurring expense, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2.4 million to 227.3 million, representing 59.0 of net sales. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales, excluding the aforementioned non-recurring estimated sales tax expense accrual, was primarily due to higher fixed costs from foundational strategic investments. Income Taxes Income tax expense was 1.6 million in the nine months ended October 27, 2024, compared to income tax benefit of 4.8 million in the nine months ended October 29, 2023. The provision for third quarter of fiscal 2024 reflected the establishment of a valuation allowance of 10.1 million established against the net amount of deferred tax assets as well as pre-tax loss in the current year. Net Loss Attributable to Controlling Interest Net loss attributable to controlling interest was 40.2 million in the nine months ended October 27, 2024 compared to net loss of 16.3 million in the nine months ended October 29, 2023 . In addition to the factors addressed above, 7.7 million in restructuring expense contributed to the net loss in the current period.

As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted EBITDA decreased to 1.5 of net sales in the nine months ended October 27, 2024 compared to 3.1 of net sales in the nine months ended October 29, 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our business relies on cash from operating activities and a credit facility as our primary sources of liquidity. Our primary cash needs have been for inventory, marketing and advertising, payroll, store leases, and capital expenditures associated with infrastructure and information technology. The most significant components of our working capital are cash, inventory, accounts payable and other current liabilities. At October 27, 2024, our net working capital was 60.6 million, including 9.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. We expect to spend approximately 23.0 million in fiscal 2024 on capital expenditures, inclusive of software hosting implementation costs, primarily due to investments in logistics optimization, including investments in the fulfillment network and information technology. Due to the seasonality of our business, a significant amount of cash from operating activities is generated during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We also use cash in our investing activities for capital expenditures throughout all four quarters of our fiscal year. We believe that our cash flow from operating activities and the availability of cash under our credit facility will be sufficient to cover working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Cash Flow Analysis A summary of operating, investing and financing activities is shown in the following table. Nine Months Ended October 27, 2024 October 29, 2023 (in thousands) Net cash used in operating activities (58,125) (31,006) Net cash used in investing activities (5,666) (39,825) Net cash provided by financing activities 40,969 33,460 Decrease in cash and cash equivalents (22,822) (37,371)

 Table of Contents 

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities Operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items that include depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities. For the nine months ended October 27, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 58.1 million, which primarily consisted of cash used in operating assets and liabilities of 47.3 million and a 40.1 million net loss for the nine months ended October 27, 2024 partially offset by depreciation of 24.7 million. The cash used in operating assets and liabilities of 47.3 million was primarily due to a 105.7 million increase in inventory, partially offset by a 53.2 million increase in trade accounts payable. The increase in inventory and trade accounts payable was primarily related to three main drivers. The first was an increase in in-transit inventory as we moved from purchasing through an agent to buying directly from factories. Another third was due to higher inventory receipts on core year-round products to mitigate low in-stock post Black Friday week. Lastly, fall winter orders arrived on time but suffered delayed sales with the unusually warmer weather. For the nine months ended October 29, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 31.0 million, which primarily consisted of cash used in operating assets and liabilities of 36.6 million and a 16.4 million net loss for the nine months ended October 29, 2023 partially offset by depreciation of 23.4 million. The cash used in operating assets and liabilities of 36.6 million was primarily due to a 19.0 million increase in inventory and 10.2 million decrease in trade accounts payable. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth related to investments in infrastructure and information technology. For the nine months ended October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 5.7 million and 39.8 million, respectively. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Financing activities consist primarily of borrowings and payments related to our revolving line of credit as well as payments on finance lease obligations. For the nine months ended October 27, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 41.0 million and 33.5 million, respectively. Contractual Obligations There have been no significant changes to our contractual obligations as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are not a party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate our accounting policies, estimates, and judgments on an on-going basis. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions and such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements. As of the date of this filing, there were no significant changes to any of the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our 2023 Form 10-K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 14 Recent Accounting Pronouncements, of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item 1, of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.

Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no significant changes in the market risks described in our 2023 Form 10-K. See Note 3 Debt and Credit Agreement, of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item 1, of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for disclosure on our interest rate related to borrowings under our credit agreement. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Section 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), requires management of an issuer subject to the Exchange Act to evaluate, with the participation of the issuer s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, the effectiveness of the issuer s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective over certain financial reporting areas due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. Management has performed additional analysis and other procedures to ensure that our condensed financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the condensed consolidated financial statements for the period covered by and included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Material Weakness As disclosed in the section titled Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures in Item 9A of the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we previously identified control deficiencies in the implementation of our internal control over financial reporting that constituted a material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting related to control deficiencies in effective risk assessment related to the mapping of general ledger accounts to the consolidated financial statements resulting in manual controls in the financial reporting process that were not designed to sufficiently mitigate the risk of incorrect presentation of certain general ledger accounts in the consolidated financial statements. Remediation Plans Management has simplified the process related to the mapping of general ledger accounts to the consolidated financial statements and performed a thorough risk assessment of the updated process to identify all risk points and design and implemented new process-level controls to mitigate the risk of incorrect presentation of general ledger accounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the material weakness cannot be considered fully remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We are taking the appropriate actions to remediate the material weakness relating to our internal control over financial reporting, as described above. Except as otherwise described herein, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We are not presently party to any legal proceedings the resolution of which we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. We establish reserves for specific legal matters when we determine that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable.
