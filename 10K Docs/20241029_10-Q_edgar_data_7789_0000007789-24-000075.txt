 The Corporation reviews the AFS investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to monitor its credit exposure. A determination as to whether a security s decline in fair value is the result of credit risk takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by security. Some factors the Corporation may consider in this impairment analysis include the extent to which the security has been in an unrealized loss position, the change in security rating, financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, as well as the security and industry specific economic conditions. 
 Based on the Corporation s evaluation, management does not believe any unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 represent credit deterioration as these unrealized losses are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and the current market conditions. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation does not intend to sell, nor does it believe that it will be required to sell, the securities in an unrealized loss position before recovery of their amortized cost basis. 
 FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stocks: The Corporation is required to maintain Federal Reserve Bank stock and FHLB stock as a member bank of both the Federal Reserve System and the FHLB, and in amounts as required by these institutions. These equity securities are restricted in that they can only be sold back to the respective institutions or another member institution at par. Therefore, they are less liquid than other marketable equity securities and their fair value is equal to amortized cost. The Corporation had FHLB stock of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Corporation had Federal Reserve Bank stock of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Accrued interest receivable on FHLB stock totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Accrued interest receivable on Federal Reserve Bank Stock totaled approximately at September 30, 2024 and there was at December 31, 2023. Accrued interest receivable on both FHLB stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock is included in interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets.

 Factors that are important to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration, systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments, effective loan review on an ongoing basis, early identification of potential problems, and appropriate policies for ACLL, nonaccrual loans, and charge offs. 
 For commercial loans, management has determined the pass credit quality indicator to include credits exhibiting acceptable financial statements, cash flow, and leverage. If any risk exists, it is mitigated by the loan structure, collateral, monitoring, or control. For consumer loans, performing loans include credits performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. 
 Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Special mention credits have potential weaknesses that warrant specific attention from management. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit. Accruing loan modifications could be pass or special mention, depending on the risk rating on the loan. Substandard loans are considered inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged. These loans generally have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which may jeopardize liquidation of the debt, and are characterized by the distinct possibility the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Management has determined commercial loan relationships in nonaccrual status, and commercial and consumer loan relationships with their terms restructured in a loan modification, meet the criteria to be individually evaluated. Commercial loans classified as special mention, substandard, and nonaccrual are reviewed at a minimum on a quarterly basis, while pass credits, which are performing rated credits, are generally reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if the loan renewal is less than one year or if otherwise warranted.

 The nature and extent of the impairment of modified loans, including those which have experienced a subsequent payment default, are considered in the determination of an appropriate level of the ACLL. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 The ACLL is comprised of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments. The level of the ACLL represents management s estimate of an amount appropriate to provide for expected lifetime credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The expected lifetime credit losses are the product of multiplying the Corporation's estimates of probability of default, loss given default, and the individual loan level exposure at default on an undiscounted basis. A main factor in the determination of the ACLL is the economic forecast. The forecast the Corporation used for September 30, 2024 was the Moody's baseline scenario from August 2024, which was reviewed against the September 2024 baseline scenario with no material updates made, over a two year reasonable and supportable period with straight-line reversion to the historical losses over the second year of the period. The allowance for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb expected lifetime losses related to unfunded credit facilities (including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit). See Note 11 for additional information on the change in the allowance for unfunded commitments.

 Mortgage Servicing Rights 
 The Corporation sells residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and typically retains the right to service the loans sold. MSRs are not traded in active markets. As a result, a cash flow model is used to determine fair value. Key assumptions and estimates, including projected prepayment speeds, assumed servicing costs, ancillary income, costs to service delinquent loans, costs of foreclosure, and discount rates with option-adjusted spreads, are used in measuring the fair value of the MSRs asset. These assumptions are considered significant unobservable inputs. See Note 11 for a discussion of the recourse provisions on sold residential mortgage loans.

 Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase 
 The Corporation enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities. Under these arrangements, the Corporation may transfer legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Corporation to repurchase the assets. The obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a liability on the Corporation s consolidated balance sheets, while the securities underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities asset accounts (i.e., there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities). 
 The Corporation utilizes repurchase agreements to facilitate the needs of its customers. The fair value of securities pledged to secure repurchase agreements may decline. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation had pledged securities valued at of the gross outstanding balance of repurchase agreements to manage this risk.

 Lending-related Commitments 
 As a financial services provider, the Corporation routinely enters into commitments to extend credit. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by the Corporation, with each customer s creditworthiness evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. The Corporation s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Corporation upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Since a significant portion of commitments to extend credit are subject to specific restrictive loan covenants or may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. An allowance for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient 
 36 

Table of Contents 

Provision for unfunded commitments ) Balance at end of period 
 Lending-related commitments include commitments to extend credit, commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to customers at predetermined interest rates, as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contracts. Interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale and forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans are considered derivative instruments, and the fair value of these commitments is recorded in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation s derivative and hedging activity is further described in Note 9. Commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being drawn on when the underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and the third party, while standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party. 
 Other Commitments 
 The Corporation invests in qualified affordable housing projects, historic projects, new market projects, and opportunity zone funds for the purpose of community reinvestment and obtaining tax credits and other tax benefits. Return on the Corporation's investment in these projects and funds comes in the form of the tax credits and tax losses that pass through to the Corporation, and deferral or elimination of capital gain recognition for tax purposes. The aggregate carrying value of these investments at September 30, 2024 was million, compared to million at December 31, 2023, included in tax credit and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Under the proportional amortization method, the Corporation amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits. The Corporation recognized additional income tax expense attributable to the amortization of investments in qualified affordable housing projects of million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The Corporation's remaining investment in qualified affordable housing projects accounted for under the proportional amortization method totaled million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. 
 The Corporation s unfunded equity contributions relating to investments in qualified affordable housing and historic projects are recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation s remaining unfunded equity contributions totaled million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, the Corporation also invests in a private SBA loan fund, recorded in equity securities on the consolidated balance sheets, which has a remaining unfunded equity contribution of million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Corporation did record any impairment related to qualified affordable housing investments. 
 The Corporation has principal investment commitments to provide capital-based financing to private companies through either direct investment in specific companies or through investment funds and partnerships. The timing of future cash requirements to fund such principal investment commitments is generally dependent on the investment cycle, whereby privately held companies are funded by private equity investors and ultimately sold, merged, or taken public through an initial offering, which can vary based on overall market conditions, as well as the nature and type of industry in which the companies operate. The Corporation also invests in loan pools that support CRA loans. The timing of future cash requirements to fund these pools is dependent upon loan demand, which can vary over time. The aggregate carrying value of these investments was million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023, included in tax credit and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets.

billion at the time of sale, consisting primarily of loans sold to GSEs. As of September 30, 2024, billion of those loans originated since remain outstanding. 
 The balance in the mortgage repurchase reserve at the balance sheet date reflects the estimated amount of potential loss the Corporation could incur from repurchasing a loan, as well as loss reimbursements, indemnifications, and other settlement resolutions. The mortgage repurchase reserve, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, was approximately ,000 at September 30, 2024 and approximately ,000 at December 31, 2023. 
 The Corporation may also sell residential mortgage loans with limited recourse (limited in that the recourse period ends prior to the loan s maturity, usually after certain time and/or loan paydown criteria have been met), whereby repurchase could be required if the loan had defined delinquency issues during the limited recourse periods. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were million and million, respectively, of residential mortgage loans sold with such recourse risk. There have been limited instances and immaterial historical losses on repurchases for recourse under the limited recourse criteria. 
 The Corporation has a subordinate position to the FHLB in the credit risk on residential mortgage loans it sold to the FHLB Mortgage Partnership Finance Traditional program in exchange for a monthly credit enhancement fee. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were million and million, respectively, of such residential mortgage loans with credit risk recourse, upon which there have been historical losses to the Corporation.

 reportable segments are Corporate and Commercial Specialty; Community, Consumer, and Business; and Risk Management and Shared Services. The financial information of the Corporation s segments has been compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in the Corporation s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, with certain exceptions. The more significant of these exceptions are described herein. 
 The reportable segment results are presented based on the Corporation's internal management accounting process. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to U.S. GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in previously reported segment financial data. Additionally, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. 
 To determine financial performance of each segment, the Corporation allocates FTP assignments, the provision for credit losses, certain noninterest expenses, income taxes, and equity to each segment. Allocation methodologies are subject to periodic adjustment as the internal management accounting system is revised, the interest rate environment evolves, and business or product lines within the segments change. Also, because the development and application of these methodologies is a dynamic process, the financial results presented may be periodically reviewed. 
 The Corporation allocates net interest income using an internal FTP methodology that charges users of funds (assets, primarily loans) and credits providers of funds (liabilities, primarily deposits) based on the maturity, prepayment and/or re-pricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities. The net effect of this allocation is offset in the Risk Management and Shared Services segment to ensure consolidated totals reflect the Corporation's net interest income. The net FTP allocation is reflected as net intersegment interest income (expense) in the accompanying tables. 
 The provision for credit losses is allocated to segments based on the expected long-term annual net charge off rates attributable to the credit risk of loans managed by the segment during the period. In contrast, the level of the consolidated provision for credit losses is determined based on an ACLL model using the methodologies described in the Corporation s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The net effect of the credit provision is recorded in Risk Management and Shared Services. Indirect expenses incurred by certain centralized support areas are allocated to segments based on actual usage (for example, volume measurements) and other criteria. Certain types of administrative expense and bank-wide expense accruals (including, when applicable, amortization of CDIs and other intangible assets associated with acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, and asset gains on disposed business units) are generally not allocated to segments. Income taxes are allocated to segments based on the Corporation s estimated effective tax rate, with certain segments adjusted for any tax-exempt income or non-deductible expenses. Equity is allocated to the segments based on regulatory capital requirements and in proportion to an assessment of the inherent risks associated with the business of the segment (including interest, credit and operating risk). 
 A brief description of each business segment is presented below. A more in-depth discussion of these segments can be found in the Segment Reporting note in the Corporation s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The Corporate and Commercial Specialty segment serves a wide range of customers including larger businesses, developers, not-for-profits, municipalities, and financial institutions by providing lending and deposit solutions as well as the support to deliver, fund, and manage such banking solutions. In addition, this segment provides a variety of investment, fiduciary, and retirement planning products and services to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. The Community, Consumer, and Business segment serves individuals, as well as small and mid-sized businesses, by providing lending and deposit solutions. The Risk Management and Shared Services segment includes key shared operational functions and also includes residual revenue and expenses, representing the difference between actual amounts incurred and the amounts allocated to operating segments, including interest rate risk residuals (FTP mismatches) and credit risk and provision residuals (long-term credit charge mismatches).

ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report contains statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such as statements other than historical facts contained or incorporated by reference into this report. These forward-looking statements include statements with respect to the Corporation s financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words believes, expects, or anticipates, references to estimates or similar expressions. Future filings by the Corporation with the SEC, and future statements other than historical facts contained in written material, press releases and oral statements issued by, or on behalf of the Corporation may also constitute forward-looking statements. 
 All forward-looking statements contained in this report or which may be contained in future statements made for or on behalf of the Corporation are based upon information available at the time the statement is made and the Corporation assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by federal securities law. Forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and the Corporation s actual results may differ materially from the expected results discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause actual results to differ from the results discussed in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risk factors in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and as may be described from time to time in the Corporation s subsequent SEC filings. 
 Overview 
 The following discussion and analysis is presented to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the Corporation s financial condition and results of operations. It is intended to complement the unaudited consolidated financial statements, footnotes, and supplemental financial data appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction therewith. Management continually evaluates strategic acquisition opportunities and various other strategic alternatives that could involve the sale or acquisition of branches or other assets, or the consolidation or creation of subsidiaries. Within the tables presented, certain columns and rows may not sum due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. 
 
 Performance Summary 
 Average loans of 29.5 billion increased 135 million from the first nine months of 2023, driven primarily by increases in auto finance and commercial lending, partially offset by a decrease in residential mortgage lending resulting from the Corporation's balance sheet repositioning. 
 Average deposits of 33.1 billion increased 2.0 billion, or 6 , from the first nine months of 2023, driven primarily by increases in time deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, savings deposits, and network transaction deposits, partially offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and money market deposits. 
 Net interest income of 777 million decreased 9 million, or 1 , from the first nine months of 2023, and net interest margin was 2.77 , compared to 2.86 for the first nine months of 2023. The decreases in net interest income and net interest margin were driven by the growth of interest bearing liabilities outpacing the growth of earning assets, paired with a smaller rate spread. 
 Provision for credit losses was 68 million, compared to a provision of 62 million for the first nine months of 2023, driven by nominal credit movement coupled with general macroeconomic trends. 
 Noninterest income of 197 million increased 3 million, or 2 , from the first nine months of 2023, driven by higher wealth management fees, an increase in bank and corporate owned life insurance, and an increase in investment securities gains (losses), net, the latter resulting from the sale of the Corporation's remaining Visa B shares in the first quarter of 2024. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking, net, as a result of net valuation adjustments of the MSRs asset. 
 Noninterest expense of 594 million increased 20 million, or 3 , from the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by increases in personnel, technology, and FDIC assessment expense, the latter due to the special assessment, partially offset by decreases in other expense and occupancy expense.

Table of Contents 

 Notable Contributions to the Change in Net Interest Income 
 Fully tax-equivalent net interest income and net interest income were 12 million, or 2 , and 9 million, or 1 , lower than the first nine months of 2023, respectively. The elevated interest rate environment has resulted in the yield on earning assets increasing by 49 bp and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increasing 60 bp from the first nine months of 2023. See sections Interest Rate Risk and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of interest rate risk and market risk. 
 Average loans increased 135 million from the first nine months of 2023, and average investments and other short-term investments increased 381 million, or 5 , from the first nine months of 2023. 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 1.6 billion, or 6 , compared to the first nine months of 2023. Average interest-bearing deposits increased 3.0 billion, or 13 , from the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by increases in time deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, savings deposits, and network transaction deposits, partially offset by a decrease in money market deposits. Average total short and long-term funding decreased 1.4 billion, or 31 , from the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in FHLB advances of 1.9 billion, or 50 , partially offset by an increase in other short-term funding related to the utilization of the BTFP. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased 1.0 billion, or 15 , versus the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses is predominantly a function of the Corporation s reserving methodology and judgments as to other qualitative and quantitative factors used to determine the appropriate level of the ACLL, which focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, changes in levels of individually evaluated and other nonaccrual loans, historical losses and delinquencies in each portfolio category, the risk inherent in specific loans, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions and economic forecasts, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other factors which could affect potential credit losses. The forecast the Corporation used for September 30, 2024 was the Moody's baseline scenario from August 2024, which was reviewed against the September 2024 baseline scenario with no material updates made, over a two year reasonable and supportable period with straight-line reversion to historical losses over the second year of the period. See additional discussion under the sections titled Loans, Credit Risk, Nonperforming Assets, and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans.

 Notable Contributions to the Change in Noninterest Expense 
 Personnel expense increased 14 million from the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by merit increases year-over-year. 
 FDIC expense increased 4 million from the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by adjustments to the FDIC's special assessment applied to the Bank. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 The Corporation records income tax expense during interim periods based on the best estimate of the full year's effective tax rate as adjusted for discrete items, if any, taken into account in the relevant interim period. Each quarter, the Corporation updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate and the effect of any change in the estimated rate is recorded on a cumulative basis. The Corporation recognized income tax expense of 27 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income tax expense of 70 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Corporation's effective tax rate from continuing operations was 8.79 and 20.43 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decreases in income tax expense and lower effective tax rate during the first nine months of 2024 were primarily due to a strategic reallocation of the investment portfolio and adoption of a legal entity rationalization plan that resulted in the recognition of deferred tax benefits of approximately 33 million. 
 Income tax expense recorded on the consolidated statements of income involves the interpretation and application of certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax laws and regulations. The Corporation is subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Examination by taxing authorities may impact the amount of tax expense and/or the reserve for uncertainty in income taxes if their interpretations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations.

 The Corporation has long-term guidelines relative to the proportion of Commercial and Business, CRE, and Consumer loan commitments within the overall loan portfolio, with each targeted to represent 30 to 40 of the overall loan portfolio. The targeted long-term guidelines were unchanged during 2023 and the first nine months of 2024. Furthermore, certain sub-asset classes within the respective portfolios are further defined and dollar limitations are placed on these sub-portfolios. These guidelines and limits are reviewed quarterly and approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Corporation s Board of Directors. These guidelines and limits are designed to create balance and diversification within the loan portfolios.

 Credit Risk 
 An active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made. Credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures, comprehensive loan administration, and periodic review of borrowers outstanding loans and commitments. Borrower relationships are formally reviewed and graded on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems. Further analysis by customer, industry, and geographic location are performed to monitor trends, financial performance, and concentrations. See Note 6 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on managing overall credit quality. 
 The loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers, industry groups, and market areas primarily within the Corporation's lending footprint. Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At September 30, 2024, no significant concentrations existed in the Corporation s portfolio in excess of 10 of total loan exposure. 
 Commercial and business lending: The commercial and business lending classification primarily includes commercial loans to large corporations, middle market companies, small businesses, and asset-based and equipment financing.

Table of Contents 

 The credit risk related to commercial and business lending is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower s operations or on the value of underlying collateral, if any. 
 Commercial real estate - investor: CRE-investor is comprised of loans secured by various non-owner occupied or investor income producing property types. 
 Table 8 Largest Commercial Real Estate Investor Property Type Exposures Sep 30, 2024 of Total Loan Exposure of Total Commercial Real Estate - Investor Loan Exposure Multi-Family 5 35 Industrial 3 26 Office 3 19 
 The remaining CRE-investor portfolio is spread over various other property types, none of which exceed 2 of total loan exposure. 
 Credit risk is managed in a similar manner to commercial and business lending by employing sound underwriting guidelines, lending primarily to borrowers in local markets and businesses, periodically evaluating the underlying collateral, and formally reviewing the borrower s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis. 
 Real estate construction: Real estate construction loans are primarily short-term or interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial income properties, multi-family projects, or residential development, both single family and condominium. Real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are generally well known to the Corporation and have prior successful project experience. The credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas but is also influenced by general economic conditions. The Corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to developers, reviewing the merits of individual projects, controlling loan structure, and monitoring project progress and construction advances.

 The remaining real estate construction portfolio is spread over various other property types, none of which exceed 2 of total loan exposure. 
 The Corporation s current lending standards for CRE and real estate construction lending are determined by property type and specifically address many criteria, including: maximum loan amounts, maximum LTV, requirements for pre-leasing and/or presales, minimum borrower equity, and maximum loan-to-cost. Currently, the maximum standard for LTV is 80 , with lower limits established for certain higher risk types, such as raw land that has a 50 LTV maximum. The Corporation s LTV guidelines are in compliance with regulatory supervisory limits. In most cases, for real estate construction loans, the loan amounts include interest reserves, which are built into the loans and sized to fund loan payments through construction and lease up and/or sell out. 
 Residential mortgages: Residential mortgage loans are primarily first lien home mortgages with a maximum loan-to-collateral value without credit enhancement (e.g. private mortgage insurance) of 80 . The residential mortgage portfolio is focused primarily in the Corporation's three-state branch footprint, with approximately 88 of the outstanding loan balances in the Corporation's branch footprint at September 30, 2024. The rates on adjustable rate mortgages adjust based upon the movement in the underlying index which is then added to a margin and rounded to the nearest 0.125 . That result is then subjected to any periodic caps to produce the borrower's interest rate for the coming term. Most of the adjustable rate mortgages have an initial fixed rate term of 3, 5, 7 or 10 years. 
 The Corporation generally retains certain fixed-rate residential real estate mortgages in its loan portfolio, including retail and private banking jumbo mortgages and CRA-related mortgages. As part of management s historical practice of originating and servicing residential mortgage loans, generally the Corporation s 30 year, agency conforming, fixed-rate residential real estate mortgage loans have been sold in the secondary market with servicing rights retained. Subject to management s analysis of the current interest rate environment, among other market factors, the Corporation may choose to retain mortgage loan production on its balance sheet.

 The Corporation s underwriting and risk-based pricing guidelines for residential mortgage loans include minimum borrower FICO score and maximum LTV of the property securing the loan. Residential mortgage products generally are underwritten using FHLMC and FNMA secondary marketing guidelines. 
 Home equity: Home equity consists of both home equity lines of credit and closed-end home equity loans. The Corporation s credit risk monitoring guidelines for home equity are based on an ongoing review of loan delinquency status, as well as a quarterly review of FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Corporation does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTV ratios after origination; however, the Corporation monitors the local housing markets by reviewing the various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring process. For junior lien home equity loans, the Corporation is unable to track the performance of the first lien loan if it does not own or service the first lien loan. However, the Corporation obtains a refreshed FICO score on a quarterly basis and monitors this as part of its assessment of the home equity portfolio. 
 The Corporation s underwriting and risk-based pricing guidelines for home equity lines of credit and loans consist of a combination of both borrower FICO score and the original cumulative LTV against the property securing the loan. Currently, the Corporation's policy sets the maximum acceptable LTV at 90 . The Corporation's current home equity line of credit offering is priced based on floating rate indices and generally allows 10 years of interest-only payments followed by a 20-year amortization of the outstanding balance. The loans in the Corporation's portfolio generally have an original term of 20 years with principal and interest payments required. 
 Indirect Auto: The Corporation currently purchases retail auto sales contracts via a network of approved auto dealerships across 16 states throughout the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwestern United States. The auto dealerships finance the sale of automobiles as the initial lender and then assign the contracts to the Corporation pursuant to dealer agreements. The Corporation s underwriting and pricing guidelines are based on a dual risk grade derived from a combination of FICO auto score and proprietary internal custom score. Minimum grade and FICO score standards ensure the credit risk is appropriately managed to the Corporation s risk appetite. Further, the grade influences loan-specific parameters such as vehicle age, term, LTV, loan amount, mileage, payment and debt service thresholds, and pricing. Maximum loan terms offered are 84 months on select grades with vehicle age, mileage, and other limitations in place to qualify. The program is designed to capture primarily prime and super prime contracts, with approximately 60 of originations typically secured by used vehicles. 
 Other consumer: Other consumer consists of student loans, short-term personal installment loans, and credit cards. Credit risk for student loans, short-term personal installment loans, and credit cards is influenced by general economic conditions, the characteristics of individual borrowers, and the nature of the loan collateral. Risks of loss are generally on smaller average balances per loan spread over many borrowers. Once charged off, there is usually less opportunity for recovery of these smaller consumer loans. Credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers, monitoring payment histories, and taking appropriate collateral and guarantee positions.

 Nonperforming Assets 
 Management is committed to a proactive nonaccrual and problem loan identification philosophy. This philosophy is implemented through the ongoing monitoring and review of all pools of risk in the loan portfolio to ensure that problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized. Table 10 provides detailed information regarding NPAs, which include nonaccrual loans, OREO, and repossessed assets, and also includes information on accruing loans past due and restructured loans:

 Nonaccrual loans: Nonaccrual loans are considered to be one indicator of potential future loan losses. See Note 6 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional nonaccrual loan disclosures. See also sections Credit Risk and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. 
 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more: Loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing interest are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured (the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest) and are in the process of collection. 
 Restructured loans: Loans are considered restructured loans if concessions have been granted to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty. See also Note 6 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional restructured loans disclosures. 
 OREO: Management actively seeks to ensure OREO properties held are monitored to minimize the Corporation s risk of loss. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 Credit risks within the loan portfolio are inherently different for each loan type. Credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards, a thorough review of potential borrowers, and ongoing review of loan payment performance. Active asset quality administration, including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems, aids in the management of credit risk and the minimization of loan losses. Credit risk management for each loan type is discussed in the section entitled Credit Risk. See Note 6 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on the ACLL. 
 To assess the appropriateness of the ACLL, the Corporation focuses on the evaluation of many factors, including but not limited to: evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans, management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio, credit report refreshes, consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience on each portfolio category, trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, the risk characteristics of the various classifications of loan segments, changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions and economic forecasts, the fair value of underlying collateral, funding assumptions on lines, and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. The forecast the Corporation used for September 30, 2024 was the Moody's baseline scenario from August 2024, which was reviewed against the September 2024 baseline scenario with no material updates made, over a two year reasonable and supportable period with straight-line reversion to historical losses over the second year of the period. Assessing these factors involves significant judgment. Because each of the criteria used is subject to change, the ACLL is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future credit losses on loans in any particular segment. Therefore, management considers the ACLL a critical accounting estimate, see section Critical Accounting Estimates for additional information on the ACLL. See section Nonperforming Assets for a detailed discussion on asset quality. See also Note 6 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional ACLL disclosures. Table 5 provides information on loan growth and period end loan composition, Table 10 provides additional information regarding NPAs, and Table 11 and Table 12 provide additional information regarding activity in the ACLL. 
 The loan segmentation used in calculating the ACLL at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was generally comparable. The methodology to calculate the ACLL consists of the following components: a valuation allowance estimate is established for 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 commercial and consumer loans determined by the Corporation to be individually evaluated, using discounted cash flows, estimated fair value of underlying collateral, and/or other data available. Loans are segmented for criticized loan pools by loan type as well as for non-criticized loan pools by loan type, primarily based on risk rating rates after considering loan type, historical loss and delinquency experience, credit quality, and industry classifications. Loans that have been criticized are considered to have a higher risk of default than non-criticized loans, as circumstances were present to support the lower loan grade, warranting higher loss factors. Additionally, management allocates ACLL to absorb losses that may not be provided for by the other components due to qualitative factors evaluated by management, such as limitations within the credit risk grading process, known current economic or business conditions that may not yet show in trends, industry or other concentrations with current issues that impose higher inherent risks than are reflected in the loss factors, and other relevant considerations. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio.

 Notable Contributions to the Change in the Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 Total loans increased 775 million, or 3 , from December 31, 2023, and decreased 202 million, or 1 , from September 30, 2023. The increase from December 31, 2023 was primarily due to growth in commercial and industrial lending and auto finance, partially offset by a decrease in real estate construction lending. The decrease from September 30, 2023 was driven by decreases in residential mortgage lending resulting from the Corporation's balance sheet repositioning and CRE - investor lending, partially offset by growth in auto finance and commercial and industrial lending. See also Note 6 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on loans. 
 Total nonaccrual loans decreased 21 million, or 14 , from December 31, 2023, and decreased 40 million, or 24 , from September 30, 2023. The decreases from both December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 were driven by decreases in nonaccrual loans within commercial and industrial lending, partially offset by increases within CRE - investor lending and CRE - owner occupied lending. See Note 6 Loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements and Table 10 for additional disclosures on the changes in asset quality. 
 YTD net charge offs increased 23 million from September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increases within commercial and industrial lending and CRE - investor lending. See Table 11 and Table 12 for additional information on the activity in the ACLL. 
 Management believes the level of ACLL to be appropriate at September 30, 2024.

 Total deposits, which are the Corporation's largest source of funds, increased 108 million from December 31, 2023, and increased 1.4 billion, or 4 , from September 30, 2023. The increase from September 30, 2023 was largely driven by increases in interest-bearing demand, other time deposits and brokered CDs, partially offset by decreases in money market and noninterest-bearing demand deposits. 
 Estimated uninsured and uncollateralized deposits, excluding intercompany deposits, were 22.3 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to 22.7 at December 31, 2023 and 22.6 at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity 
 The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that the Corporation has the ability to generate sufficient cash or cash equivalents in a timely and cost effective manner to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to meet its other commitments as they become due. The Corporation s liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Corporation s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs in the ordinary course of business, as well as to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Corporation engages in various activities to manage its liquidity risk, including diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed. 
 The Corporation performs dynamic scenario analysis in accordance with industry best practices. Measures have been established to ensure the Corporation has sufficient high quality short-term liquidity to meet cash flow requirements under stressed scenarios. In addition, the Corporation also reviews static measures such as deposit funding as a percentage of total assets and liquid asset levels. Strong capital ratios, credit quality, and core earnings are also essential to maintaining cost effective access to wholesale funding markets. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation was in compliance with its internal liquidity objectives and had sufficient asset-based liquidity to meet its obligations even under a stressed scenario. 
 The Corporation maintains diverse and readily available liquidity sources, including: 
 Lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB, which require eligible loan and investment collateral to be pledged. Based on the amount of collateral pledged, the FHLB established a collateral value from which the Bank may draw advances, and issue letters of credit in favor of public fund depositors, against the collateral. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had 6.2 billion available for future funding. The Federal Reserve Bank also establishes a collateral value of assets to support borrowings from the discount window. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had 3.0 billion available for discount window borrowings. 
 A 200 million Parent Company commercial paper program, of which there was none outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 64 

Table of Contents 

 Dividends and service fees from subsidiaries, as well as the proceeds from issuance of capital, which are also funding sources for the Parent Company. 
 Acquisition related equity issuances by the Parent Company; the Corporation has filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which the Parent Company may, from time to time, offer shares of the Corporation s common stock in connection with acquisitions of businesses, assets, or securities of other companies. 
 Other issuances by the Parent Company; the Corporation maintains on file with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement, under which the Parent Company may offer the following securities, either separately or in units: debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, and warrants. 
 Bank issuances; the Bank may also issue institutional CDs, network transaction deposits, and brokered CDs. 
 Global Bank Note Program issuances; the Bank has implemented a program pursuant to which it may from time to time offer up to 2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating and financing activities was 373 million and 843 million, respectively, while net cash used in investing activities was 1.2 billion, for a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of 43 million since year-end 2023. At September 30, 2024, assets of 42.2 billion increased 1.2 billion, or 3 , from year-end 2023, primarily due to loan growth and increases in AFS securities. On the funding side, deposits of 33.6 billion increased 108 million from year-end 2023, short-term funding increased 590 million, or 181 , and other long-term funding increased 303 million, or 56 , the latter primarily driven by the Corporation's issuance of senior notes in August 2024. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating and financing activities was 378 million and 1.9 billion, respectively, while net cash used in investing activities was 2.2 billion, for a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of 91 million since year-end 2022. At September 30, 2023, assets of 41.6 billion increased 2.2 billion, or 6 , from year-end 2022, primarily due to loan growth and increases in AFS securities. On the funding side, deposits of 32.1 billion increased 2.5 billion, or 8 , from year-end 2022, FHLB advances decreased 587 million, or 14 , while other long-term funding increased 281 million, or 113 , the latter due to the issuance of subordinated debt.

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk and interest rate risk are managed centrally. Market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed-income securities, equity securities, other earning assets, and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors. Interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates. As a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products, the Corporation is exposed to both market risk and interest rate risk. In addition to market risk, interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods. The Corporation uses financial modeling simulation techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk. 
 Policies established by the Corporation s ALCO and approved by the Board of Directors are intended to limit these risks. The Board has delegated day-to-day responsibility for managing market and interest rate risk to ALCO. The primary objectives of market risk management are to minimize any adverse effect that changes in market risk factors may have on net interest income and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets recorded at fair value. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the Board of Directors. These limits and guidelines reflect the Corporation's risk appetite for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. 
 The major sources of the Corporation's non-trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and re-pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models which are employed by management to understand interest rate sensitive EAR and MVE at risk. The Corporation s interest rate risk profile is such that, generally, a higher yield curve adds to income while a lower yield curve has a negative impact on earnings. The Corporation's EAR profile is asset sensitive at September 30, 2024. 
 For further discussion of the Corporation's interest rate risk and corresponding key assumptions, see the Interest Rate Risk section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Corporation s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in EAR due to gradual moves in benchmark interest rates from a baseline scenario over 12 months. We evaluate the sensitivity using: 1) a dynamic forecast incorporating expected growth in the balance sheet, and 2) a static forecast where the current balance sheet is held constant. 
 While a gradual shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under a probable scenario, an instantaneous shift in interest rates would have a more significant impact. No EAR breaches occurred during the first nine months of 2024. 
 Table 15 Estimated Change in Rate Sensitive Earnings at Risk Over 12 Months Sep 30, 2024 Dec 31, 2023 Dynamic Forecast Static Forecast Dynamic Forecast Static Forecast Gradual Rate Change 100 bp increase in interest rates 1.6 1.5 1.9 2.2 200 bp increase in interest rates 2.9 2.7 3.8 4.3 100 bp decrease in interest rates (1.0) (0.7) (1.3) (1.5) 200 bp decrease in interest rates (2.0) (1.4) (2.6) (3.1) 
 At September 30, 2024, the MVE profile indicates a decrease in net balance sheet value due to instantaneous upward changes in rates and an increase in net balance sheet value due to instantaneous downward changes in rates. 
 Table 16 Market Value of Equity Sensitivity Sep 30, 2024 Dec 31, 2023 Instantaneous Rate Change 100 bp increase in interest rates (9.8) (10.1) 200 bp increase in interest rates (20.1) (20.1) 100 bp decrease in interest rates 8.7 9.7 200 bp decrease in interest rates 16.4 18.5

 Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changes in product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The MVE measure in the 200 bp increase in interest rates scenario is outside of the policy limit, which has been reported to the Corporation's Board. 
 The above EAR and MVE measures do not include all actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.

 Capital 
 Management actively reviews capital strategies for the Corporation and each of its subsidiaries in light of perceived business risks, future growth opportunities, industry standards, and compliance with regulatory requirements. The assessment of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors, including asset quality, liquidity, stability of earnings, changing competitive forces, economic conditions in markets served, and strength of management. At September 30, 2024, the capital ratios of the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries were in excess of regulatory minimum requirements. The Corporation s capital ratios are summarized in the following table. 
 Compliance with regulatory minimum capital requirements is a tool used in assessing the Corporation's capital adequacy, but not determinative of how the Corporation would fare under extreme stress. Factors that may affect the adequacy of the Corporation's capital include the inherent limitations of fair value estimates and the assumptions thereof, the inherent limitations of the regulatory risk-weights assigned to various asset types, the inherent limitations of accounting classifications of certain investments and the effect on their measurement, external macroeconomic conditions and their effects on capital and the Corporation's ability to raise capital or refinance capital commitments, and the extent of steps taken by state or federal government authorities in periods of extreme stress. 
 For additional information regarding the potential for additional regulation and supervision, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Sequential Quarter Results 
 The Corporation reported net income of 88 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income of 116 million for the second quarter of 2024, the decrease primarily due to an income tax benefit recorded during the second quarter of 2024. Net income available to common equity was 85 million for the third quarter of 2024, or 0.56 for both basic and diluted earnings per common share. Comparatively, net income available to common equity for the second quarter of 2024 was 113 million, or 0.75 for basic earnings per common share and 0.74 for diluted earnings per common share (see Table 1). 
 Fully tax-equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 266 million, 6 million, or 2 , higher than the second quarter of 2024. The net interest margin in the third quarter of 2024 was up 3 bp to 2.78 . Average earning assets increased 193 million, or 1 , to 38.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Average loans increased 55 million, primarily driven by growth within the auto finance portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in commercial lending. On the funding side, average total interest-bearing deposits increased 751 million, or 3 , driven primarily by increases in time deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a decrease in money market deposits. Average FHLB advances decreased 682 million, or 28 , largely due to the increase in average deposits (see Table 2). 
 The provision for credit losses was 21 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 23 million for the second quarter of 2024 (see Table 11). See discussion under sections: Provision for Credit Losses, Nonperforming Assets, and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. 
 Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 67 million, up 2 million, or 3 from the second quarter of 2024, largely driven by an increase in fee based revenue (see Table 3). 
 Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 201 million, up 5 million, or 2 , from the second quarter of 2024, driven primarily by an increase in other expense (see Table 4). 
 For the third quarter of 2024, the Corporation recognized income tax expense of 20 million, compared to an income tax benefit of 13 million for the second quarter of 2024. See section Income Taxes for a more detailed discussion. 
 
 Comparable Quarter Results 
 The Corporation reported net income of 88 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income of 83 million for the third quarter of 2023. Net income available to common equity was 85 million for the third quarter of 2024, or 0.56 for both basic and diluted earnings per common share. Comparatively, net income available to common equity for the third quarter of 2023 was 80 million, or 0.53 for both basic and diluted earnings per share (see Table 1). 
 Fully tax-equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 266 million, 7 million, or 3 , higher than the third quarter of 2023. The net interest margin between the comparable quarters was up 7 bp, to 2.78 in the third quarter of 2024. The increases in net interest income and net interest margin were due to a mix shift in earning assets resulting in earning asset income growing by more than the growth of interest-bearing liability costs. Average earning assets increased 115 million to 38.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Average loans decreased 251 million, or 1 , primarily driven by a decrease in residential mortgage lending, partially offset by an increase in auto finance lending. On the funding side, average interest-bearing deposits increased 2.0 billion, or 8 , from the third quarter of 2023, due to increases in nearly all deposit categories, partially offset by a decrease in money market deposits. Average short and long-term funding decreased 1.1 billion, or 26 , primarily driven by lower FHLB advances (see Table 2). 
 The provision for credit losses was 21 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a provision of 22 million for the third quarter of 2023 (see Table 11). See discussion under sections: Provision for Credit Losses, Nonperforming Assets, and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. 
 Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 67 million, up approximately 642,000, or 1 , compared to the third quarter of 2023 (see Table 3). 
 Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 201 million, up 4 million, or 2 , from the third quarter of 2023, driven primarily by an increase in personnel expense (see Table 4). 
 The Corporation recognized income tax expense of 20 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to income tax expense of 19 million for the third quarter of 2023. See section Income Taxes for a more detailed discussion.

 Notable Changes in Segment Financial Data 
 The Corporate and Commercial Specialty segment consists of lending and deposit solutions to larger businesses, developers, not-for-profits, municipalities, and financial institutions, and the support to deliver, fund, and manage such banking solutions. In addition, this segment provides a variety of investment, fiduciary, and retirement planning products and services to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. 
 Total revenue increased 15 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased 43 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to higher loan volumes and interest rates driving net interest income higher. 
 Noninterest expense increased 11 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher personnel costs. 
 Average loans increased 163 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased 353 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by growth in commercial and business lending and residential mortgage lending. 
 Average deposits decreased 151 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023, and decreased 234 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by decreases in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and money market deposits, partially offset by an increase in interest-bearing demand deposits. 
 The Community, Consumer, and Business segment consists of lending and deposit solutions to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. 
 Total revenue increased 26 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to receiving net FTP credit for providing funding for the Corporation and higher interest rates. 
 Average loans decreased 412 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023, and decreased 249 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by a decrease in residential mortgage lending resulting from the Corporation's balance sheet repositioning, partially offset by an increase in auto finance lending. 
 Average deposits increased 370 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased 199 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by increases in time deposits and savings deposits, partially offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and money market deposits. 
 The Risk Management and Shared Services segment includes key shared Corporate functions, Parent Company activity, intersegment eliminations, and residual revenues and expenses. 
 Total revenue decreased 75 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increased interest expense. 
 Average earning assets increased 356 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased 416 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by higher balances of AFS investment securities in the portfolio. 
 Average deposits increased 1.1 billion from the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased 2.1 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increases in brokered CDs and network deposits, partially offset by a decrease in money market deposits. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The determination of the ACLL is particularly susceptible to significant change. A discussion of these estimates can be found in the Critical Accounting Estimates section in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Corporation s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no changes in the Corporation's application of critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023.
