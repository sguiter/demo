reportable segments: Systems Support and Interiors. Systems Support consists of the Company s operations that provide integrated solutions, including design; development; and support of proprietary components, subsystems and systems, as well as production of complex assemblies using external designs. Capabilities include hydraulic, mechanical and electromechanical actuation, power, and control; a complete suite of aerospace gearbox solutions, including engine accessory gearboxes and helicopter transmissions; active and passive heat exchange technology; fuel pumps, fuel metering units, and Full Authority Digital Electronic Control fuel systems; and hydromechanical and electromechanical primary and secondary flight controls. As disclosed in Note 3, in December 2023 the Company entered into a definitive agreement with AAR Corp. AAR ), to sell Systems Support's maintenance, repair, and overhaul operations located in Wellington, Kansas; Grand Prairie, Texas; San Antonio, Texas; Hot Springs, Arkansas; and Chonburi, Thailand Product Support ). As a result of this agreement, the Company has classified the Product Support results of operations for all periods presented as discontinued operations, and these operations are no longer reported as part of the Systems Support reportable segment. Interiors consists of the Company s operations that have historically supplied commercial, business, and regional manufacturers with large metallic structures and continues to supply aircraft interior systems, including air ducting and thermal acoustic insulations systems. Subsequent to the divestitures disclosed in Note 3, the remaining operations of Interiors are those that supply commercial and regional manufacturers with aircraft interior systems. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Triumph and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated from the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ), which requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments in this ASU must be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. The Company has not determined the impact ASU 2023-07 may have on the Company s financial statement disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09"), which improves income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The ASU indicates that all entities will apply its guidance prospectively with an

to of delivery. The Company generally is not subject to collecting sales tax and has made an accounting policy election to exclude from the transaction price any sales and other similar taxes collected from customers. As a result, any such collections are accounted for on a net basis.

Warrants for every shares of common stock held as of December 12, 2022 (the "Record Date"). The Company issued approximately million Warrants on December 19, 2022, to holders of record of common stock as of the close of business on the Record Date. Each Warrant represented the right to purchase initially share of common stock, at an exercise price of per Warrant, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. Payment for shares of common stock on exercise of Warrants could have been made in (i) cash or (ii) under certain circumstances, certain of the Company's outstanding notes (the "Designated Notes"). The common stock warrants were accounted for as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40 and included within accrued liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company measured the Warrants at fair value as of the issuance date using a Monte Carlo pricing model, a Level 3 fair value measurement (as described below), due to the level of market activity. Inherent in the option pricing simulation are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life and risk-free interest rate. The Company estimated the volatility of the Warrants based on implied and historical volatility of the Company s common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the Warrants. The expected life of the Warrants was based on the Company s ability to redeem the Warrants, subject to a 20 calendar-day notice period, as well as the automatic acceleration of the Expiration Date following the Price Condition Date. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, due to increased trading volume, the Company began remeasuring outstanding Warrants using the Warrants trading price, a Level 1 fair value measurement (as described below). The Warrants were remeasured at each balance sheet date. Warrants remeasurement adjustments were recognized in warrant remeasurement gain, net on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. At distribution, the fair value of the Warrants was . Approximately million Warrants were exercised in the year ended March 31, 2024, resulting in total cash proceeds, net of transaction costs, of approximately and of warrants remeasurement gain was recognized in the six months ended September 30, 2023 . On July 6, 2023 , the Company redeemed all of the approximately million remaining outstanding Warrants for a total redemption price of approximately pursuant to its June 16, 2023, notice of redemption.

subject to adjustments related to the closing balance sheet and certain transaction expenses. This transaction closed on March 1, 2024, and the Company recognized a gain of approximately , net of transaction costs and certain other purchase price adjustments. In July 2024, the Company finalized certain purchase price adjustments principally related to the transferred working capital of the divested operations and recognized a gain of approximately in the six months ended September 30, 2024. The gain is included within discontinued operations on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations. Product Support companies provided aftermarket maintenance, repair, and overhaul solutions for commercial, regional and military aircraft. As a result of this transaction, effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we classified our results of operations for all periods presented to reflect Product Support as discontinued operations. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we will continue to guarantee the performance of certain of the divested legal entities pursuant to pre-existing performance guarantee agreements covering existing contracts with specific customers that are expected to be fully satisfied within the next twelve months. There is no limitation to the maximum potential future liabilities under these guarantee agreements; however, we are fully indemnified by the buyer, AAR, against such losses that may arise from their failure to perform under the related contracts. The Company has also indemnified the buyer for a period of from the date of the transaction on product liability or warranty claims related to Product Support products and operations prior to the transaction date to the extent such claims exceed an aggregate amount of . Other than these guarantees, a short-term transition services agreement, commercial purchases and sales which are not significant and are entered into in the ordinary course of business, and other customary short-term transitional activities, the Company will have no further continuing involvement with Product Support.

 and in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively . The accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows do not present cash flows from discontinued operations separately from cash flows from continuing operations. Capital expenditures and other operating and investing noncash items of the discontinued operations for the six months ended September 30, 2023 were immaterial. Fiscal 2023 Divestitures In January 2022, the Company s Board of Directors committed to a plan to sell its manufacturing operations located in Stuart, Florida. In February 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with the buyer of these manufacturing operations. This transaction closed in July 2022. The Company recognized a gain of approximately , net of transaction costs in fiscal year 2023. In the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company paid to the buyer of the Stuart manufacturing operations and recognized a loss of approximately due to the resolution of claims by the buyer related to the accounts payable representation and warranty under the purchase agreement and the finalization of certain purchase price adjustments related to the transferred working capital of the divested operations. Additionally, in the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized a loss on sale of approximately related to an adjustment that would have reduced the fiscal 2023 gain on sale. Other claims for indemnification with the Buyer of the Stuart facility (refer to Note 12) remain outstanding. The operating results of the Stuart, Florida, manufacturing operations are included within the Interiors reportable segment through the date of divestiture.

Contract Assets and Liabilities Contract assets primarily represent revenues recognized for performance obligations that have been satisfied or partially satisfied but for which amounts have not been billed. This typically occurs when revenue is recognized over time but the Company's contractual right to bill the customer and receive payment is conditional upon the satisfaction of additional performance obligations in the contract, such as final delivery of the product. Contract assets are typically derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Company pools contract assets that share underlying risk characteristics and records an allowance for expected credit losses based on a combination of prior experience, current economic conditions and management s expectations of future economic conditions, and specific collectibility matters when they arise. Contract assets are presented net of this reserve on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, credit loss expense and write-offs related to contract assets were immaterial. Contract liabilities are recorded when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of the Company satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations to be satisfied over a period of time. Contract liabilities other than those pertaining to forward loss reserves are derecognized when or as revenue is recognized. Contract modifications can also impact contract asset and liability balances. When contracts are modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements, the Company considers whether the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. When contract modifications include additional performance obligations that are distinct and at relative stand-alone selling price, they are accounted for as a new contract and performance obligation and are recognized prospectively. Contract modifications that are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration with the original good or service provided are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. For such contracts, the effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and the Company's measure of progress for the performance obligations is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. When contract modifications do not include additional performance obligations but the remaining goods and services are distinct from those already provided, the Company treats the modification as the termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract, and the total remaining transaction price is allocated to the remaining performance obligations using the relative stand-alone selling price as of the date of the modification and is recognized prospectively.

As of September 30, 2024 , the maximum amount available under the Securitization Facility was .

At September 30, 2024, there were in borrowings and in letters of credit outstanding under the Securitization Facility, primarily to support insurance policies. In October 2024, the Company drew in borrowings under the Securitization Facility. The Securitization Facility expires in December 2025. The agreements governing the Securitization Facility contain restrictions and covenants, including limitations on the making of certain restricted payments; creation of certain liens; and certain corporate acts such as mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all the Company's assets. Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2028 On March 14, 2023, the Company issued principal amount of Senior Secured First Lien Notes due March 15, 2028, pursuant to an indenture among the Company, the Guarantor Subsidiaries, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the 2028 First Lien Notes ).

 principal amount of Senior Notes due (the "2025 Notes". In the year ended March 31, 2024 , approximately in principal amount of the 2025 Notes were used to pay the exercise price for approximately million Warrants. In August 2023, the Company executed a 10b5-1 repurchase plan agreement with a third-party (the "Agent") granting the Agent the authority to repurchase on the open market up to in principal amount of the 2025 Notes, subject to specific conditions, including daily volume and market prices.

(1) For the six months ended September 30, 2024, approximately shares associated with outstanding restricted stock unit awards were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the resulting incremental shares would have been anti-dilutive due to the loss from continuing operations in the period. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, approximately shares, associated with outstanding restricted stock unit awards were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the resulting incremental shares would have been anti-dilutive due to the loss from continuing operations in each period.

 and , respectively, most of which would impact the effective rate, if recognized. The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced in the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a valuation allowance against principally all of its net deferred tax assets given insufficient positive evidence to support the realization of the Company s deferred tax assets. The Company intends to continue maintaining a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets until there is sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of this allowance. A reduction in the valuation allowance could result in a significant decrease in income tax expense in the period that the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the reduction in its valuation allowance is unknown at this time and will be subject to the earnings level the Company achieves during fiscal 2025 and future periods. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was as compared with for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective income tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2024, was as compared with for the six months ended September 30, 2023. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local income tax examinations for fiscal years ended before March 31, 2014, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years ended before March 31, 2014. The Company believes appropriate provisions for all outstanding issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years.

reportable segments: Systems Support and Interiors. The Company s reportable segments are aligned with how the business is managed, and the Company's views of the markets it serves. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (the "CODM") evaluates performance and allocates resources based upon review of segment information. The CODM utilizes earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and pension Adjusted EBITDAP as a primary measure of segment profitability to evaluate performance of its segments and allocate resources. Financial information for Systems Support differs from information reported in prior periods as this reportable segment no longer includes the results of operations of Product Support which have been reclassified for all periods as discontinued operations. Segment Adjusted EBITDAP is total segment revenue reduced by operating expenses (less depreciation and amortization) identifiable with that segment. Corporate includes general corporate administrative costs and any other costs not identifiable with one of the Company s segments. The Company does not accumulate net sales information by product or service or groups of similar products and services, and therefore the Company does not disclose net sales by product or service because to do so would be impracticable.

 . The decision also indicated that TAS would be responsible for reimbursing Northrop for remediation costs at two of the facilities incurred subsequent to September 2023. Such incremental remediation costs for the period from September 2023 to June 30, 2024 are estimated to be approximately , and estimated incremental remediation costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024, are immaterial. Accordingly, TAS has accrued a total of approximately following the decision, of which was recognized in the six months ended September 30, 2024, and is presented within legal contingencies loss on the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations. The Company estimates that total future remediation costs reimbursable to Northrop could be up to approximately , and result in annual cash expenditures not likely to exceed to per year. In addition, TAS is a party to the environmental remediation regulatory order at one of the properties. Therefore, in accordance with ASC 410-30, Environmental obligations, the Company has accrued approximately as management's best estimate of the total future remediation costs at this property. TAS intends to continue to vigorously defend itself in this matter and has filed a motion to seek to set aside the adverse decision from the arbitration panel. Commercial Disputes and Litigation Throughout the course of the Company s programs, disputes with suppliers or customers have arisen and could arise in the future regarding unique contractual requirements, quality, costs or impacts to production schedules. If the Company is unable to successfully and equitably resolve such claims and assertions, its business, financial condition, results of operations, customer relationships and related transactions could be materially adversely affected. In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in disputes, claims and lawsuits with employees, suppliers and customers, as well as governmental and regulatory inquiries, that it deems to be immaterial. Some may involve claims or potential claims of substantial damages, fines, penalties or injunctive relief. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of any pending or future commercial dispute, litigation or proceeding and no assurances can be given, the Company does not believe that any pending matter will have a material effect, individually or in the aggregate, on its financial position or results of operations. Divestitures, Disposals, Guarantees, and Indemnifications As disclosed in Note 3, we have engaged in a number of divestitures. In connection with divestitures and related transactions, the Company from time to time has indemnified and has been indemnified by third parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with, among other things, business activities prior to the completion of the respective transactions. The term of these indemnifications, which typically pertain to environmental, tax and product liabilities, is generally indefinite. As of September 30, 2024, no indemnification assets or liabilities have been recorded. As it relates to certain divestitures, disputes have arisen or may continue to arise between the Company and the acquirer subsequent to the completion and closing of the divestiture transaction. Such disputes have included or may include amounts payable to or from the buyer for closing working capital adjustments to the purchase price as well as claims regarding alleged violations of contractual terms, representations, and warranties of the sale agreements, among other matters. The outcome of such disputes typically involve negotiations between the Company and the acquirer, but could also lead to litigation between the parties, including as disclosed further below, and the ultimate claims made by the parties against each other could be material. The Company has received notification of claims which allege certain bases for indemnification and damages relating to certain divestitures. The relevant agreements generally contain limits on certain damages that may be payable under the relevant agreements. For example, the divestiture agreement relating to the sale of the Red Oak facility specified that representations and warranties insurance would be the sole and exclusive remedy for breach of representations and warranties except in the case of fraud. By way of further example, the divestiture agreement relating to the sale of the Stuart facility contains an general cap on breaches of representations (other than certain specified representations) and a cap on breaches of certain specified representations related to contracts and product warranties, in each case absent certain circumstances, including fraud or breaches of fundamental or tax representations. As disclosed in Note 3, on June 16, 2023, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the buyer of the Stuart facility resolving a working capital dispute with the buyer resulting in an amount of payable to the Company and resolving claims by the buyer related to the accounts payable representation and warranty under the purchase agreement resulting in an amount of payable to the buyer, with such amount applicable to the general 

 23 

Triumph Group, Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

 to the buyer. The purchaser of the Stuart facility also commenced litigation against the Company on December 12, 2023, seeking additional indemnification for damages claimed to be approximately for losses allegedly arising from the knowing breach of certain representations and warranties regarding the financial condition of TAS and the products manufactured by TAS and alleged failures to disclose known and widespread paint issues and certain supplier and production issues at the facility prior to the closing. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of any pending or future divestiture related litigation, proceeding, or claim and no assurances can be given, the Company intends to vigorously defend claims brought against it and does not believe that this matter or others will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. If the Company is unable to successfully and equitably resolve such claims and assertions, its business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, in connection with certain divestitures, the Company has obtained customer consent to assign specified long-term contracts to the acquirer of the divested business by entering into consent-to-assignment agreements among the customer, the acquirer, and the Company. Pursuant to certain of these agreements, the Company remains a guarantor pursuant to guarantee agreements with the customer that predate the divestiture transaction. The term of these obligations typically covers a period of to from the date of divestiture. There is no limitation to the maximum potential future liabilities under these contracts; however, the Company typically has a right to indemnification from acquirers against such losses that may arise from the acquirers failure to perform under the assigned contracts. On June 13, 2024, Boeing submitted correspondence to the Company asserting that under the terms of a guarantee agreement between Boeing and the Company (the Guarantee Agreement ), the Company would be responsible for damages that Boeing may suffer from any production disruption caused by Qarbon Aerospace, LLC Qarbon ), the acquirer of the Company s Red Oak facility, on the T7-A program, which is the subject of ongoing litigation between the Company and Qarbon. Boeing has provided certain details regarding its contractual dispute with Qarbon, but has not alleged any damages incurred. As of September 30, 2024, no related indemnification assets or liabilities or guarantee liabilities have been recorded. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against any assertion that Boeing is entitled to damages from the Company under the Guarantee Agreement, but the Company has concluded that a loss is reasonably possible. At this time, based on the early stage of this matter, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the amount of any damages that Boeing has incurred or may claim. Separately, pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement providing for Qarbon s acquisition of the Red Oak facility, the Company is entitled to indemnification from Qarbon. Also, in connection with certain divestitures, the Company has assigned lease facility agreements to the acquirers and entered into guarantee agreements with respect to the lease agreement in the event of non-performance under the lease by the assignee. The Company typically has a right to indemnification from the assignee or other third party to the transaction. On May 2, 2023, the Company received a letter from a lessor associated with one such transaction to assert the lessor s rights against the Company as guarantor. The lease payment associated with the lease is approximately per month over a lease term ending December 31, 2031, although the landlord may be barred from recovery due to its acceptance of the lessee's surrender of the premises. The Company currently estimates that a reasonably possible loss, if any, would be recoverable through indemnification and be immaterial. In the year ended March 31, 2023, the Company withdrew from the IAM National Pension Fund (the Fund), which is a multiemployer pension plan to which the Company previously contributed on behalf of certain of its represented employees. Such withdrawal occurred as part of the Company s exit of its Spokane, Washington, composites manufacturing operations. In April 2023, the Company received a letter from the Fund confirming the Company s complete withdrawal from the Fund and indicating that the Company s portion of the unfunded vested benefits (the Withdrawal Liability was estimated to be approximately , payable in quarterly installments of approximately over a period of approximately thirteen years. As of September 30, 2024, the Company's liability for this obligation is included on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet is approximately , representing its estimate of the remaining obligation before interest based on the letter received from the Fund. The Company has issued a formal challenge through arbitration on the issue of the interest rate used by the Fund when determining the Withdrawal Liability, and it is possible the Withdrawal Liability could be reduced during that process.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein. 
 OVERVIEW 
 Business 
 We are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have two reportable segments: (i) Systems Support, whose companies revenues are derived from integrated solutions, including design, development and support of proprietary components, subsystems and systems, production of complex assemblies using external designs; and (ii) Interiors, whose companies' revenues are primarily derived from supplying commercial and regional manufacturers with thermo-acoustic insulation, composite components, ducting and primarily to customer designs and model-based definition. 
 
 Discontinued Operations 
 As disclosed in Note 3, in March 2024, we completed the sale of third-party maintenance, repair, and overhaul operations located in Wellington, Kansas; Grand Prairie, Texas; San Antonio, Texas; Hot Springs, Arkansas; and Chonburi, Thailand Product Support and recognized a gain in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. As a result of this transaction, we have classified the Product Support results of operations for all periods presented as discontinued operations and these operations are no longer reported as part of the Systems Support reportable segment. As a result, and unless specifically stated, all discussions regarding results for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, reflect results from our continuing operations. Refer to Note 3 for further discussion of this divestiture. 
 Summary of Significant Financial Results 
 Significant financial results for the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, include: 
 Net sales were 287.5 million compared with 284.7 million for the prior year period. 

Operating income was 32.4 million compared with 22.5 million for the prior year period. 

Income from continuing operations was 9.1 million, or 0.15, per diluted common share, compared with loss from continuing operations of 5.3 million and (0.08) per diluted common share, for the prior year period. 

Net income was 11.9 million, or 0.15 per diluted common share, compared with net loss, including prior year period income from discontinued operations, of 1.3 million, or 0.02) per diluted common share, for the prior year period. 

Backlog as of September 30, 2024 was 1.90 billion of which we estimate that approximately 1.20 billion will be shipped by September 30, 2025. 

We used 142.9 million of cash in operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with cash used in operations of 95.9 million in the comparable prior year period. 

Warrants Distribution 
 As disclosed in Note 2, on December 19, 2022, we issued approximately 19.5 million Warrants to holders of record of common stock as of the Record Date. Each Warrant represented the right to purchase initially one share of common stock at an exercise price of 12.35 per Warrant. Payment for shares of common stock on exercise of Warrants could have been made in (i) cash or (ii) under certain circumstances, Designated Notes (as defined in Note 2). Approximately 8.1 million warrants were exercised since the date of the Warrants initial distribution on December 19, 2022, through July 6, 2023. In the year ended March 31, 2024, approximately 7.7 million warrants were exercised for total cash proceeds, net of transaction costs, of approximately 80.0 million. On July 6, 2023, the Company redeemed all of the approximately 11.4 million outstanding Warrants for a total redemption price of less than 0.1 million. In total, as a result of the Warrant exercises, from the date of issuance on December 19, 2022, through redemption on July 6, 2023, the Company increased its cash by approximately 84.1 million and reduced debt by approximately 14.4 million. 
 Significant Developments in Key Programs 
 Discussion of significant developments on key programs is included below. 
 
 25 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 Boeing 737 
 The Boeing 737 program represented approximately 10 of revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 13 for the six months ended September 30, 2023 inclusive of both OEM production and aftermarket sales. Of the total revenue recognized on the 737 program, OEM production revenue represented approximately 73 and 88 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In October 2024, Boeing publicly disclosed that the timing of 737 production rate recovery was uncertain but that expectations remained for an eventual return to 38 per month. With the November 4, 2024, resolution of the strike by Boeing employees represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at the Boeing facility that produces the 737, we do not expect the impact of the work stoppage to be material to our results of operations or financial condition. 
 No other programs are expected to represent more than 10 of our consolidated net sales. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following includes a discussion of our consolidated and business segment results of operations. Our diverse structure and customer base do not provide for precise comparisons of the impact of price and volume changes to our results. However, we have disclosed the significant variances between the respective periods. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We prepare and publicly release annual audited and quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") rules, we also disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our public filings and earning releases. Currently, the non-GAAP financial measures that we disclose are Adjusted EBITDA, which is our income (loss) from continuing operations before interest and gains or losses on debt modification and extinguishment, income taxes, amortization of acquired contract liabilities, costs incurred pertaining to shareholder cooperation agreements, consideration payable to customer related to divestitures, legal contingency losses (including legal judgments and settlements), gains/loss on divestitures, gains/losses on warrant remeasurements and warrant-related transaction costs, share-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization (including impairment of long-lived assets), other non-recurring impairments, and the effects of certain pension charges such as curtailments, settlements, withdrawals, and other early retirement incentives; and Adjusted EBITDAP, which is Adjusted EBITDA, before pension expense or benefit (excluding pension charges already adjusted in Adjusted EBITDA). We disclose Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated and Adjusted EBITDAP on a consolidated and a reportable segment basis in our earnings releases, investor conference calls and filings with the SEC. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Also, in the future, we may disclose different non-GAAP financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations with our previously reported results of operations. 
 We view Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP as operating performance measures and, as such, we believe that the U.S. GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to such measures is income (loss) from continuing operations. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP, we exclude from income (loss) from continuing operations the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day-to-day operation of our continuing business. We have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as a result of these exclusions. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity, as an alternative to income (loss) from continuing operations, or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDAP as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure, including income (loss) from continuing operations. In addition, we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP to income (loss) from continuing operations set forth below, in our earnings releases, and in other filings with the SEC and to carefully review the U.S. GAAP financial information included as part of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Annual Reports on Form 10-K that are filed with the SEC, as well as our quarterly earnings releases, and compare the U.S. GAAP financial information with our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP are used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that, when viewed with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. We have spent more than 20 years expanding our product and service capabilities, partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Due to the expansion of our operations, which included acquisitions, our income (loss) from continuing operations has included significant charges for 
 26 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business, apart from charges for depreciation and amortization. We believe the disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year. We also believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, and nonoperating items, such as interest, income taxes, pension and other postretirement benefits, provides additional information about our cost structure and, over time, helps track our operating progress. In addition, investors, securities analysts, and others have regularly relied on Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP to provide financial measures by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry. 
 Set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our income (loss) from continuing operations to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP and the material limitations associated with using these non-GAAP financial measures as compared with income (loss) from continuing operations: 
 Gains or losses from sale of assets and businesses may be useful for investors to consider because they reflect gains or losses from sale of operating units or other assets. We do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. 

Warrants remeasurement gains or losses and warrant-related transaction costs may be useful for investors to consider because they reflect the mark-to-market changes in the fair value of our Warrants and the costs associated with Warrants issuance. We do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. 

Consideration payable to a customer related to a divestiture may be useful for investors to consider because it reflects consideration paid to facilitate the ultimate sale of operating units. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. 

Shareholder cooperation expenses may be useful for investors to consider because they represent certain costs that may be incurred periodically when reaching cooperative agreements with shareholders. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. 

Legal contingencies loss, when applicable, may be useful for investors to consider because it reflects gains or losses from legal disputes with third parties. We do not believe these gains or losses reflect the current and ongoing earnings related to our operations. 

Non-service defined benefit income or expense from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans (inclusive of certain pension related transactions such as curtailments, settlements, withdrawals, and early retirement or other incentives) may be useful for investors to consider because they represent the cost of postretirement benefits to plan participants, net of the assumption of returns on the plan's assets and are not indicative of the cash paid for such benefits. We do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. 

Amortization of acquired contract liabilities may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the noncash earnings on the fair value of off-market contracts acquired through acquisitions. We do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. 

Amortization expense and nonrecurring asset impairments (including goodwill and intangible asset impairments) may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of trade names, product rights, licenses, or, in the case of goodwill, other assets that are not individually identified and separately recognized under U.S. GAAP, or, in the case of nonrecurring asset impairments, the impact of unusual and nonrecurring events affecting the estimated recoverability of existing assets. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure. 

Depreciation may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure. 

Share-based compensation may be useful for investors to consider because it represents a portion of the total compensation to management and the board of directors. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure. 

The amount of interest expense and other, as well as debt modification and extinguishment gains or losses, we incur may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows. However, we do not consider the amount of interest expense and other and debt extinguishment gains or losses to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business. 

Income tax expense may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds 

27 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 otherwise available for use in our business. However, we do not consider the amount of income tax expense to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business. 

Management compensates for the above-described limitations of using non-GAAP measures by using a non-GAAP measure only to supplement our GAAP results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business.

Net Sales 
 Commercial OEM sales decreased 11.6 million, or 8.9 , primarily due to decreased sales volume on the Boeing 737, 767, and 777 programs which were partially offset by increased sales on the Boeing 787 program and a favorable settlement in Interiors for deliveries occurring between July 1, 2024 and September 30, 2024 across multiple programs. We expect this Interiors agreement will also benefit our results of operations over the remainder of fiscal 2025 as we continue to perform on these programs. 
 Military OEM sales increased 3.0 million, or 4.9 , as increased sales volume on CH-47 and AH-64 helped to offset expected decreases sales on the V-22 program. 
 Commercial Aftermarket sales increased 10.4 million, or 26.2 , primarily due to a combination of increased spares and repairs sales volume across several platforms including the Boeing 787 program. 
 28 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 Military aftermarket sales increased 0.2 million, or 0.5 , as increased repairs volume on the CH-47 platform and a spare parts intellectual property transaction of approximately 5.0 million in the current year period were partially offset by decreased rotorcraft repair and overhaul sales on the V-22 program. 
 Non-aviation sales were stable on steady demand.

Operating Income 
 Consolidated gross profit margin increased year over year to 32.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 26.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The margin benefits from the increased mix in aftermarket sales as a percentage of total sales, including the spare parts intellectual property transaction disclosed above, and the favorable settlement in Interiors were partially offset by decreased OEM volume and continued inflationary increases in labor and material costs. Operating income increased approximately 9.9 million due to the increased margins. 
 Non-service Defined Benefit Expense (Income) 
 Non-service defined benefit expense was approximately 1.5 million, a decrease of approximately 2.3 million from non-service defined benefit income in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to changes in actuarial assumptions and experience. 
 Debt Modification and Extinguishment 
 No debt extinguishment gains occurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Debt extinguishment gains of 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, were the result of the repurchase of our debt on the open market. 
 Warrant Remeasurement Gain 
 No warrant remeasurement gains were recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2024, because of the fiscal 2024 redemption of all outstanding Warrants on July 6, 2023, for a total redemption price of less than 0.1 million. 
 Interest Expense and Other 
 Interest expense and other decreased due to lower debt levels primarily due to the redemption of approximately 556.7 million of long-term debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and an additional 120.0 million of redemption of long-term debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income tax benefit was 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting an effective tax rate of (30.5) . compared with (19.3) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Business Segment Performance Three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared with three months ended September 30, 2023 
 We report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments: Systems Support and Interiors. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") utilizes Adjusted EBITDAP as a primary measure of profitability to evaluate performance of its segments and allocate resources. 
 The results of operations among our reportable segments vary due to differences in competitors, customers, extent of proprietary deliverables and performance. For example, Systems Support, which generally includes proprietary products and/or arrangements where we become the primary source or one of a few primary sources to our customers, our unique engineering and manufacturing capabilities command a higher margin. 
 29 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 Refer to Note 1 for further details regarding the operations and capabilities of each of our reportable segments. 
 We currently generate a majority of our revenue from sales to OEMs and aftermarket MRO services in the commercial airline and military and defense markets. Our growth and financial results are largely dependent on continued demand for our products and services within these markets. If any of the related industries experiences a downturn, our clients in these sectors may conduct less business with us. The loss of one or more of our major customers or an economic downturn in the commercial airline or the military and defense markets could have a material adverse effect on our business.

 Non-service Defined Benefit Expense (Income) 
 Non-service defined benefit expense was approximately 2.5 million, a decrease of approximately 4.1 million from non-service defined benefit income in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to changes in actuarial assumptions and experience. 
 Debt Modification and Extinguishment 
 Debt modification and extinguishment losses were approximately 5.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with debt modification and extinguishment gains of approximately 4.1 million in the prior year period. The current period extinguishment losses were the result of the redemption of 120.0 million in 2028 First Lien Notes in the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Warrant Remeasurement Gain 
 No warrant remeasurement gains were recognized in the six months ended September 30, 2024, because of the fiscal 2024 redemption of all outstanding Warrants on July 6, 2023, for a total redemption price of less than 0.1 million.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Discontinued Operations 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows do not present the cash flows from discontinued operations separately from cash flow from continuing operations. Capital expenditures and other operating and investing noncash items of the discontinued operations for the six months ended September 30, 2023, were immaterial. 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 Our working capital needs are generally funded through our current cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and the availability of proceeds from the Securitization Facility. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net cash outflow of 142.9 million from operating activities compared with a net cash outflow of 95.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 47.0 million. Cash flows were primarily driven by timing of receivables and payables, including the liquidation of approximately 20.5 million of customer advances received as of March 31, 2024, as well as increases in inventory as a result of anticipated increasing demand and supply chain challenges which we expect to improve in the second half of fiscal 2025. Cash flows from operations are consistent with seasonal working capital needs, and we expect continued improvement in the remainder of fiscal 2025. Interest payments were approximately 46.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 74.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, with the decrease due to lower debt levels. 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 Cash flows used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 2.6 million from the six months ended September 30, 2023. Cash flows used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024, were principally related to capital expenditures of approximately 14.5 million. Cash flows used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2023, included payments on the sale of assets and businesses of 6.8 million with additional investing outflows from capital expenditures of 11.0 million. We currently expect full year capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 to be in the range of 20.0 million to 25.0 million. The majority of our planned fiscal 2025 capital expenditures are capital investments designed to improve our manufacturing efficiency and expand our capabilities. 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 Cash flows used in financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024, were 127.5 million, compared with cash flows provided by financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2023, of 59.2 million. Current period financing cash flows pertain primarily to our redemption of approximately 120.0 million of our 2028 First Lien Notes at a redemption price equal to 103.000 of the principal amount redeemed, resulting in a premium upon redemption of 3.6 million. We may from time to time pursue other redemptions or repurchases, but we cannot make assurances of if or when any such activity may take place, or the terms thereof. As of September 30, 2024, we had 104.9 million of cash on hand and 43.6 million was available under our Securitization Facility after giving effect to approximately 20.8 million in outstanding letters of credit, all of which were accruing

 interest at 0.125 per annum, and the current outstanding balance. In October 2024, the Company drew 20,000 in borrowings under the Securitization Facility. 
 Refer to Note 12 for disclosures related to certain indemnifications, consent-to-assignment agreements, and guarantee agreements associated with our divestiture activities. 
 The 2028 First Lien Notes are our senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other future senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. 
 The 2028 First Lien Notes are (a) effectively senior to all existing and future second lien obligations and all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries, but only to the extent of the value of the Collateral (as defined below), and after giving effect to any permitted additional first lien secured obligations and other permitted liens of senior or equal priority; (b) secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with any future permitted additional first lien secured obligations, subject to a Collateral Trust Agreement (as defined below); (c) effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries that are secured by assets that do not constitute the Collateral, in each case, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations; and (d) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company s existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2028 First Lien Notes, including the Securitization Facility. 
 The 2028 First Lien Notes are guaranteed on a full, senior, joint and several basis certain of the Company s domestic restricted subsidiaries (the Guarantor Subsidiaries ). Currently, our only consolidated subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the 2028 First Lien Notes (the "Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries") are: (i) the receivables securitization special purpose entity, and (ii) charitable foundation entity. The 2028 First Lien Notes and the related guarantees are secured by first-priority liens on substantially all of our assets and our subsidiary guarantors, whether now owned or hereafter acquired (the Collateral ). 
 Pursuant to the documentation governing the 2028 First Lien Notes, we may redeem some or all of the 2028 First Lien Notes prior to their stated maturities, subject to certain limitations set forth in the indenture governing the 2028 First Lien Notes and, in certain cases, subject to significant prepayment premiums. We are obligated to offer to repurchase the 2028 First Lien Notes at 101 of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase as a result of certain change-of-control events and a sale of all or substantially all of our assets. These restrictions and prohibitions are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. 
 The indenture governing the 2028 First Lien Notes, as well as Securitization Facility, contain covenants and restrictions that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of any of the Guarantor Subsidiaries to (i) grant liens on our assets; (ii) make dividend payments, other distributions or other restricted payments; (iii) incur restrictions on the ability of the Guarantor Subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or investments; (iv) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (v) merge, consolidate, transfer or dispose of substantially all of their assets; (vi) incur additional indebtedness; (vii) use the proceeds from sales of assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries (in the case of the 2028 First Lien Notes); and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates. We are currently in compliance with all covenants under our debt documents and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future. 
 For further information on our long-term debt, see Note 6. 
 The following tables present summarized financial information of the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis. The combined summarized financial information eliminates intercompany balances and transactions among the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries and equity in earnings and investments in any Guarantor Subsidiaries or Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements that appear in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Except as otherwise disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report, there were no material changes subsequent to the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, in our critical accounting policies or in the assumptions or estimates used to prepare the financial information appearing in this report. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 relating to our future operations and prospects, including statements that are based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate, and our beliefs concerning future performance and capital requirements based upon current available information. Such statements are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. When used in this document, words like may, might, will, expect, anticipate, believe, potential, "plan," "estimate," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. For example, there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required, and that such amounts may be material, or that additional capital, if required, will be available on reasonable terms, if at all, at such times and in such amounts as may be needed by us. In addition to these factors, among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are uncertainties relating to our ability to execute on our restructuring plans, the integration of acquired businesses, divestitures of our business, efforts to optimize our asset base, general economic conditions affecting our business segments, severe disruptions to the economy, the financial markets, and the markets in which we compete, dependence of certain of our businesses on certain key customers, and the risk that we will not realize all of the anticipated benefits from efforts to optimize our asset base, as well as competitive factors relating to the aerospace industry. For a more detailed discussion of these and other factors affecting us, see the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on May 31, 2024, and in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 For information regarding our exposure to certain market risks, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. There has been no material change in this information during the period covered by this report. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we completed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
 There were no changes that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Part II. Other Information 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 On December 12, 2023, a complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by Daher, the buyer of the Stuart facility, against TAS and the Company, alleging claims for breach of contract and fraudulent inducement of contract arising out of the sale of the Stuart facility. The Complaint alleges that TAS failed to disclose known and widespread paint issues, as well as certain supplier and production issues at the facility, which rendered certain representations and warranties about the financial condition of the Stuart facility and the products manufactured by the Stuart facility false. The Complaint seeks damages of approximately 130.0 million consisting of (a) approximately 60.0 million Daher agreed to pay Boeing for alleged non-conformities in products Daher manufactured and/or sold to Boeing after the closing; (b) approximately 30.0 million for future opportunities Daher claims to have lost; and (c) approximately 40.0 million for internal costs Daher claims to have incurred in fixing alleged non-conformities in products. The divestiture agreement relating to the sale of the Stuart facility contains an 18.75 million general cap on breaches of representations (other than certain specified representations) and a 25.0 million cap on breaches of certain specified representations related to contracts and product warranties, in each case absent certain circumstances, including fraud or breaches of fundamental or tax representations. Previously, on June 16, 2023, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the buyer of the Stuart facility resolving a working capital dispute with the buyer resulting in an amount of 2.4 million payable to the Company and resolving claims by the buyer related to the accounts payable representation and warranty under the purchase agreement resulting in an amount of 9.2 million payable to the buyer, with such amount applicable to the general cap referred to above. The amounts were settled on a net basis by the Company paying 6.8 million to the buyer. 
 TAS and the Company dispute that they engaged in any fraudulent conduct, dispute that they breached the representations and warranties in the divestiture agreement, dispute the damages claimed (and that Daher could, in any event, recover any damages in excess of the liability caps set forth in the divestiture agreement) and intend to vigorously defend this matter. The Company believes that the likelihood of further loss is remote, and the amount of potential loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 
 On May 7, 2024, a complaint was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by Qarbon, the buyer of the Red Oak facility, against TAS and the Company, alleging claims for breach of contract, fraudulent inducement of contract, and unjust enrichment arising out of the sale of the Red Oak facility. The complaint alleges that TAS failed to disclose potential future losses associated with the Boeing T-7A trainer program, which rendered certain representations and warranties about the financial condition of the Red Oak facility false. The complaint seeks partial rescission of the divestiture agreement as it relates to assignment of the T-7A contract and damages for past and future losses in an unspecified amount under the T-7A contract. 
 TAS and the Company dispute that they engaged in any fraudulent conduct, dispute that they breached the representations and warranties in the divestiture agreement (all of which expired more than two years ago under the terms of the divestiture agreement and with respect to which buyer had procured a representations and warranties insurance policy), dispute the damages claimed (and that Qarbon could, in any event, recover any damages in excess of the liability caps set forth in the divestiture agreement), dispute that unjust enrichment and partial rescission would be legally appropriate remedies, and intend to vigorously defend this matter. The Company believes that the likelihood of loss is remote, and the amount of potential loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in other disputes, claims and lawsuits with employees, suppliers and customers, as well as governmental and regulatory inquiries, that are deemed to be immaterial. Some may involve claims or potential claims of substantial damages, fines, penalties or injunctive relief regarding unique contractual requirements, quality, costs, or impacts to production schedules. In addition, in connection with certain other divestitures made by the Company, we have received claims relating to closing working capital adjustments to purchase prices as well as claims regarding alleged violations of contractual terms, representations, and warranties of the sale agreements and demands for honoring guarantee or indemnification obligations. 
 While we cannot predict the outcome of any pending or future litigation, proceeding or claim and no assurances can be given, we intend to vigorously defend claims brought against the Company and do not believe that any other pending matters will have a material effect, individually or in the aggregate, on our financial position or results of operations. If we are unable to successfully and equitably resolve such claims and assertions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

In the event that a lesser amount is paid under clause (ii)(B) above, then the elements of Executive's payments hereunder shall be reduced in such order (1) as the Company determines, in its sole discretion, has the least economic detriment to the Executive and (2) which does not result in the imposition of any tax penalties under Section 409A on the Executive. To the extent the economic impact of reducing payments from one or more elements is equivalent, and subject to clause (2) of the preceding sentence, the reduction may be made pro-rata by the Company in its sole discretion.

 (d) Invalidity. If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall to any extent be invalid or unenforceable, the

thereby, and each term and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
 (e) Survivability.

(f) Section Headings; Construction. The section headings used in this Agreement are included solely for convenience and shall not affect, or be used in connection with, the interpretation hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, the term including shall mean including, without limitation. 

(g) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

(h) Tax Withholding. The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state, local or foreign taxes as shall be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 

(i) Section 409A. 

(i) General. It is intended that payments and benefits made or provided under this Agreement shall not result in penalty taxes or accelerated taxation pursuant to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder Section 409A ). Any payments that qualify for the short-term deferral exception, the separation pay exception or another exception under Section 409A shall be paid under the applicable exception. Each payment of compensation or benefit to be provided under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment of compensation for purposes of applying the exclusion under Section 409A for short-term deferral amounts, the separation pay exception or any other exception or exclusion under Section 409A. All payments of nonqualified deferred compensation to be made upon a termination of employment under this Agreement may only be made upon a separation from service under Section 409A to the extent necessary in order to avoid the imposition of penalty taxes on the Executive pursuant to Section 409A. In no event may the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment under this Agreement. 

(ii) Reimbursements and In-Kind Benefits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement that are subject to Section 409A shall be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirement that (A) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during the Executive's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement); (B) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits 

provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year; (C) the reimbursement of an eligible expense 

shall be made no later than the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred; and (D) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 
 (iii)	 Delay of Payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Executive is considered a specified employee for purposes of 
 Section 409A (as determined in accordance with the methodology established by the Company as in effect on the date of termination), any payment on account of the Executive's separation from service that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A and that is otherwise due to the Executive under this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following the Executive's separation from service (as determined in accordance with Section 409A) shall be accumulated and paid to the Executive on the first business day of the seventh month following the Executive's separation from service (the Delayed Payment Date ). If the Executive dies during the postponement period, the amounts and entitlements delayed on account of Section 409A shall be paid to the personal representative of the Executive's estate on the first to occur of the Delayed Payment Date or 30 days after the date of the Executive's death. 
 (j) Parachute Payments. In the event that any payments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise (i) constitute parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ), as determined by the accounting firm that audited the Company prior to the relevant change in ownership or control within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or another nationally known accounting or employee benefits consulting firm selected by the Company prior to such change in ownership or control (the Accounting Firm and (ii) but for this Section 7(j), would, in the judgment of the Accounting Firm, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code by reason of Section 280G of the Code, then the Executive's benefits under this Agreement shall be payable either: (A) in full, or (B) as to such lesser amount which would result in no portion of such payments or benefits being subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, as determined by the Accounting Firm, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income and employment taxes and the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, results in the receipt by Executive, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of payments and benefits under this Agreement, as determined by the Accounting Firm, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such payments and benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. In the event that a lesser amount is paid under clause (ii)(B) above, then the elements of Executive's payments hereunder shall be reduced in such order (1) as the Company determines, in its sole discretion, has the least economic detriment to the Executive and (2) which does not result in the imposition of any tax penalties under Section 409A on the Executive. To the extent the economic impact of reducing payments from one or more elements is equivalent, and subject to clause (2) of the preceding sentence, the reduction may be made pro-rata by the Company in its sole discretion. 

(k) Amendments. No provision of this Agreement shall be modified or amended except by an instrument in writing duly executed by the parties hereto. No custom, act, payment, favor or indulgence shall grant any additional right to the Executive or be deemed a 

waiver by the Company of any of the Executive's obligations hereunder or release the Executive therefrom or impose any additional obligation upon the Company. No waiver by any party of any 

breach by the other party of any term or provision hereof shall be deemed to be an assent or waiver by any party to or of any succeeding breach of the same or any other term or provision. 
 (l)	 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the plans referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto on the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels in their entirety all prior understandings, agreements and commitments, whether written or oral, relating to the terms and conditions of employment between the Executive and the Company. 
 (m)	 Authority. By signing this Agreement (and any award referred to herein), the officer signing this Agreement on behalf of the Company attests that this Agreement has been duly approved by the Compensation Committee.

ANNEX A 
 Restrictive Covenants 
 (a) Disclosure of Confidential Information. You shall not at any time during your employment with TGI or its subsidiaries (together, the Company or thereafter, except as properly required in the course of your employment, use, publish, disclose or authorize anyone else to use, publish or disclose any Confidential Information belonging or relating to the Company. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, models, drawings, blueprints, memoranda and other materials, documents or records of a proprietary nature; information relating to research, manufacturing processes, bills of material, finance, accounting, sales, personnel management and operations; and information particularly relating to customer lists, price lists, customer service requirements, costs of providing service and equipment, pricing and equipment maintenance costs. 

(b) Patents, Copyrights and Trade Secrets. You will disclose, and hereby assign, to the Company any and all material of a proprietary nature, particularly including, but not limited to, material subject to protection as trade secrets or as patentable or copyrightable ideas which you may conceive, invent, or discover during the course of your employment with the Company which relate to the business of the Company, or were developed using the Company's resources (collectively, the Inventions ), and you shall execute and deliver all papers, including applications for patents and do such other acts (entirely at the Company's expense) as may be necessary for the Company to obtain and maintain proprietary rights in any and all countries and to vest title to such Inventions in the Company. 

(c) Noncompetition and Non-solicitation. While you are employed by the Company and for the one-year period following the termination of such employment for any reason (together, the Restricted Period ), you shall not, in any jurisdiction in which the Company is doing business, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, consult with, be employed by, participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or otherwise render services to or engage in, any business engaged in by the Company; provided that your ownership of securities constituting 2 or less of any publicly traded class of securities of a public company shall not violate this paragraph. During the Restricted Period, you shall not solicit for business or accept the business of, any person or entity who is, or was at any time within the previous 12 months, a customer or client of the business conducted by the Company (or potential customer or client with whom the Company or its affiliates had initiated contact). During the Restricted Period, you shall not, directly or indirectly, employ, solicit for employment, or otherwise contract for or hire, the services of any individual who is then an employee of the Company or who was an employee of the Company within the previous 12 months. Further, during the Restricted Period, you shall not take any action that could reasonably be expected to have the effect of inducing any individual who is then an employee, representative, officer or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or who was an employee, representative, officer or director of the Company within the previous 12 months, to cease his or her relationship with the Company for any reason. 

(d) Acknowledgements and Remedies. 

(i) The parties hereto agree that the provisions of clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this Annex A (the 

Covenants are reasonable under the circumstances of your acceptance of the Performance Award to which this Annex A is attached. You acknowledge and agree that the Covenants are reasonable in light of all of the circumstances, are sufficiently limited to protect the legitimate interests of the Company, impose no undue hardship on you, and are not injurious to the public. You further agree that your services are of a personal, special and unique character and cannot be replaced by the Company, and that the violation by you of any of the Covenants would cause the Company irreparable harm, which could not be adequately compensated by money damages, and that if the Company elects to prevent you from breaching such provisions by obtaining an injunction against you, there is a reasonable probability of the Company's eventual success on the merits. Accordingly, you consent and agree that if you commit any such breach or threaten to commit any breach, in addition to any other remedies as may be available to the Company for such breach, including the recovery of money damages, the Company shall be entitled (without the necessity of showing economic loss or other actual damage) to (A) forfeit your Performance Award if the underlying shares of Common Stock have not been issued or require you to return the shares of Common Stock underlying the Performance Award if issued and (B) seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, without posting any bond or other security and without the necessity of proof of actual damage. Furthermore, if TGI institutes any action or proceeding to enforce any of the provisions of this Annex A, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby waive the claim or defense that TGI has an adequate remedy at law, and you shall not assert in any such action or proceeding the defense that any such remedy exists at law. 

(ii) You represent that, in accepting this Performance Award, you are not relying on any statements or representations made by any of the Company's directors, officers, employees or agents that are not expressly set forth herein, and that you are relying only upon your own judgment and any advice, if any, provided by your attorney. 

(iii) In light of the acknowledgements contained in this clause (d), you agree not to challenge or contest the reasonableness, validity or enforceability of any limitations and obligations contained in this Annex A. In the event that the Covenants shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of their extending for too great a period of time or over too great a geographical area or by reason of their being too extensive in any other respect, they shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time for which they may be enforceable and/or over the maximum geographical area as to which they may be enforceable and/or to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which they may be enforceable, all as determined by such court.
