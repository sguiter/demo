credit markets and expected future financial performance, as well as any information concerning possible or assumed future results of

million as of September 30, 2024 million as of December 31, 2023). The recoverability of the carrying value of the assets
and the Company s continued existence is dependent upon the achievement of profitable operations, or the ability of the Company
to raise alternative financing, if necessary. While management has been historically successful in raising the necessary capital, it
cannot provide assurance that it will be able to execute its business strategy or be successful in future financing activities. As of
September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficiency of million (as of December 31, 2023, a working capital deficiency
of million) which is comprised of current assets less current liabilities. 

These
conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that cast significant doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern and, therefore, the Company may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course
of business.

Based
on management s evaluation of the above indicators, the Company reports consumer products revenues on a gross basis. 

Esports 

League
Participation: Generally, The Company has one performance obligation to participate in the overall Esport event because
the underlying activities do not have standalone value absent the Company s participation in the tournament or event. Revenue from
prize winnings and profit-share agreements is variable and is highly uncertain. The Company recognizes revenue at the point in time when
the uncertainty is resolved. 

Player
Transfer Fees: Player transfer agreements include a fixed fee and may include a variable fee component. The Company recognizes the
fixed portion of revenue from transfer fees upon satisfaction of the Company s performance obligation, which coincides with the
execution of the related agreement. The variable portion of revenue is considered highly uncertain and is recognized at the point in
time when the uncertainty is resolved. 

Licensing
of Intellectual Property: The Company s licenses of intellectual property generate royalties that are recognized in accordance
with the royalty recognition constraint. That is, royalty revenue is recognized at the time when the sale occurs. 

The
Company assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. When
the Company acts in the capacity of an agent rather than as the principal in a transaction, the revenue recognized is the net amount
of commission made by the Company. 

Deferred
revenue consists of customer advances for Company services to be rendered that will be recognized as income in future periods. 

The
Company had one customer whose revenue accounted for approximately 
and 
 of total revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

One
customer individually accounted for more than 
of the Company s accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024, and no customer as of December 31, 2023. 

The
Company acquired all issued and outstanding FaZe common shares in exchange for 0.13091 of a GameSquare common share for each FaZe common
share (the Exchange Ratio ). All outstanding FaZe equity awards and warrants to purchase shares of FaZe common stock were
acquired and exchanged for GameSquare equity awards and warrants to purchase GameSquare common stock on substantially the same terms,
with exercise prices, where applicable, and shares issuable adjusted for the Exchange Ratio. 

The
Company incurred transaction costs of million associated with the Merger. All such costs were expensed as incurred. The net loss
attributed to FaZe s operations from the acquisition date to September 30, 2024, was million, with revenue of million. 

The
Merger was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under ASC 805, Business Combinations , which requires that
the Company recognize the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their fair values on the date of acquisition. The
estimated fair values are preliminary and based on the information that was available as of that date.

Measurement
period adjustments 

Where
provisional values are used in accounting for a business combination, they may be adjusted in subsequent periods, not to exceed twelve
months. The primary areas that are subject to change relate to the fair value of the purchase consideration transferred and purchase
price allocations related to the fair values of certain tangible assets, the valuation of intangible assets acquired, and residual goodwill.
The Company expects to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair value of the net assets acquired during the measurement
periods. 

Goodwill 

The
difference between the estimated acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the estimated values assigned to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents goodwill of million. 

The
goodwill recorded represents the following: 

Cost
 savings and operating synergies expected to result from combining the operations of FaZe with those of the Company. 

Intangible
 assets that do not qualify for separate recognition such as the assembled workforce. 

Goodwill
arising from the Merger is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 

(b)
 Sale of Complexity 

On
March 1, 2024, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary GameSquare Esports (USA), Inc., entered into a Membership Interest Purchase
Agreement (the MIPA to sell all of the issued and outstanding equity interest of NextGen Tech, LLC Complexity to Global Esports Properties, LLC (the Buyer (the Transaction ). 

Pursuant
to the MIPA, Buyer paid the Company aggregate purchase consideration with a Transaction closing date fair value of million in exchange
for the equity interests of Complexity, including million paid in cash upon closing of the transaction and issuance of a secured
subordinated promissory note (the Note with a Transaction closing date fair value of million. The Note was valued
using a discount rate of (Level 3). 

As
a result of the Transaction, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Complexity met the requirements to be reported as discontinued
operations (see Note 17). The Company recognized a gain of million in net income (loss) from discontinued operations in the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss after offsetting the consideration received with the carrying value of the disposed assets
and liabilities. Complexity assets and liabilities disposed had a net carrying value of million and consist primarily of million
of accounts receivable, million of property and equipment, and million of intangible assets, partially offset by million
of accounts payable million of accrued liabilities. 

The
Note has a principal amount of million and bears interest at per annum. The principal amount of the Note, together with all
accrued interest, is due on . The Note is secured by assets of the Buyer pursuant to a Security Agreement executed in
conjunction with the MIPA between the Company and the Buyer.

Current
Market Conditions 

GameSquare
is pursuing organic growth opportunities, as well as M A growth opportunities. From August 2020 to March 2024, the Company has completed
five acquisitions and divested two non-core assets. GameSquare s organic growth strategy focuses on growing audience and reach
within its digital agencies, media network, and teams segments. GameSquare s digital agencies, teams, and services segments serve
the gaming and esports market, and more broadly sports and entertainment through content creation, audience development and growing brand
relationships. The digital agency industry is highly fragmented, and these businesses are generally characterized by high revenue growth
with healthy earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization margins, which management believes positions the Company well
for sustainable growth through organic efforts and presents significant opportunities to grow through accretive acquisitions. 

The
combination of Engine Gaming s best-in-class technology assets with GameSquare s award-winning agency and creative capabilities,
allows the Company to offer unparalleled insight into consumer behaviors. It also allows GameSquare to develop data-driven creative strategies,
and measure and optimize campaigns towards customer acquisition goals in real-time - creating impactful marketing solutions that drive
ROI for its customers. 

The
Company has invested in its sales organization and continues to see significant growth in the number, and the size, of requests for proposals
within its agency businesses. The Company s financial profile compares very favorably against its esports peers, as well as other
companies seeking to engage with youth audiences. 

The
Company believes enterprise growth may come as a result of synergistic approaches to combining the strengths of its multiple SaaS companies
that it can present as a unified offering to the market.

settlement reserve income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.3 million, in comparison to 1.0 million for

Income
tax benefit 

There
was no income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in comparison to 16 thousand for the same period in 2023. The

Management s
use of Non-GAAP Measures 

This
MD A contains certain financial performance measures, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, that are
not recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and do not have a
standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. As a result, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
For a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable financial information presented in the Financial Statements in
accordance with GAAP, see the section entitled Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures below. 

We
believe EBITDA is a useful measure to assess the performance of the Company as it provides more meaningful operating results by excluding
the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses.
We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) income taxes; and (iii) interest expense. 

Adjusted
EBITDA 

We
believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure to assess the performance of the Company as it provides more meaningful operating results
by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring
expenses. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to exclude extraordinary items, non-recurring items and other non-cash
items, including, but not limited to (i) share based compensation expense, (ii) transaction costs related to merger and acquisition activities,
(iii) arbitration settlement reserves and other non-recurring legal settlement expenses, (iv) restructuring costs, primarily comprised
of employee severance resulting from integration of acquired businesses, (v) impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, (vi) gains
and losses on extinguishment of debt, (vii) change in fair value of assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value on a quarterly basis,
(viii) gains and losses from discontinued operations, and (ix) Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest. 

Reconciliation

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Overview 

The
financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which assumes the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities
in the normal course of business. Continuing operations, as intended, are dependent on management s ability to raise required funding
through future equity issuances, its ability to acquire business interests and develop profitable operations or a combination thereof,
which is not assured, given today s volatile and uncertain financial markets. We may revise programs depending on our working capital
position. 

Our
approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due. Our liquidity and
operating results may be adversely affected if our access to the capital market is hindered, whether as a result of a downturn in stock
market conditions generally or as a result of conditions specific to the Company. 

We
regularly evaluate our cash position to ensure preservation and security of capital as well as maintenance of liquidity. As we do not
presently generate sufficient revenue to cover costs, managing liquidity risk is dependent upon the ability to reduce monthly operating
cash outflow and secure additional financing. The recoverability of the carrying value of the assets and our continued existence is dependent
upon our ability to raise financing in the near term, and ultimately the achievement of profitable operations. 

As
of September 30, 2024, cash and restricted cash totaled 11.2 million,
compared to 3.0 million as of December 31, 2023. 

While
management has been historically successful in raising the necessary capital, it cannot provide assurance that it will be able to execute
its business strategy or be successful in future financing activities. 

Our
ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, our ability
to raise additional funds through financing, those related to consumer demand and acceptance of our products and services, our ability
to collect payments as they become due, achieving our internal forecasts and objectives, the economic conditions of the United States
and abroad. 

37 

Sources
and Uses of Cash 

Since
inception, we have financed our operations primarily by issuing equity and debt. As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity
were our cash in the amount of 11.2 million, available borrowings under our line of credit as well as new debt and/or equity issuances. 

As
discussed in recent developments above, we obtained gross proceeds of 10.0 million from the PIPE Financing on March 7, 2024. 

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 25.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 10.2 million used
in operating activities in the comparative period. The use of funds in operating activities is described in the Results of Operations
section above. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by investing activities was 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net
cash provided by investing activities was 11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 30.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily due to PIPE
Financing on March 7, 2024 of 10 million and cash investments by non-controlling interests of Faze Media, Inc. of 20.5 million. Net
cash provided by financing activities was 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Commitments
and Contingencies 

Management
commitments 

The
Company is party to certain management contracts. These contracts require payments of approximately 0.6 million to be made upon the
occurrence of a change in control and termination without cause to certain officers of the Company. The Company is also committed to
payments upon termination without cause of approximately 1.1 million pursuant to the terms of these contracts. As a triggering event
has not taken place, these amounts have not been recorded in these consolidated financial statements. 

Former
activities 

The
Company was previously involved in oil and gas exploration activities in Canada, the United States and Colombia. The Company ceased all
direct oil and gas exploration activities in 2014. While management estimated that the exposure to additional liabilities from its former
oil and gas activities over and above the reclamation deposits held in trust for the Alberta Energy Regulator of 0.3 million to be remote,
the outcome of any such contingent matters is inherently uncertain. 

Litigation
and arbitration 

We
are subject to various claims, lawsuits and other complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. We record provisions for losses
when claims become probable, and the amounts are estimable. Although the outcome of such matters cannot be determined, it is the opinion
of management that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operations,
or liquidity.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Revenue
recognition 

Revenue
is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control
of its services to a customer. 

The
following provides information about the nature and timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations in contracts with customers,
including significant payment terms and related revenue recognition policies: 

Talent
representation service revenues 

Talent
representation service revenue is recorded on completion of the event in which the talent management service has been provided. 

Influencer
promotional fees 

Influencer
marketing and promotional fees are recognized over the period during which the services are performed. Revenue and income from custom
service contracts are determined on the percentage of completion method, based on the ratio of contract timepassed in the reporting period
over estimated total length of the contract. 

Consulting
fees and other revenues 

Consulting
fees and other revenues are recognized when the services have been performed. 

Software-as-a-service 

The
Company enters into license agreements with customers for its e-sports
and gaming data platform (Stream Hatchet) and influencer marketing platform (SideQik). These license agreements, generally non-cancellable,
without paying a termination penalty, and multiyear, provide the customer with the right to use the Company s application solely
on a Company-hosted platform. The license agreements also entitle the customer to technical support. 

Revenue
from these license agreements is recognized ratably over the license term. Early termination fees are recognized when a customer ceases
use of agreed upon services prior to the expiration of their contract. These fees are recognized in full on the date the customer has
completed their migration of the Company s solutions and there is no continuing service obligation to the customer. 

The Company also charges
its customers for the use of its ad serving platform to serve ads under local advertising campaigns. The Company reports revenue as earned
based on the actual usage. 

Advertising 

Under
national advertising agreements with advertisers, the Company sources, creates, and places advertising campaigns that run across the
Company s network of publisher sites. National advertising revenue, net of third-party costs, is shared with publishers based on
their respective contractual agreements. The Company invoices national advertising amounts due from advertisers and remits payments to
publishers for their share. Depending on the agreement with the publisher, the obligation to remit payment to the publisher is based
on either billing to the advertiser or the collection of cash from the advertiser. 

National
advertising revenue is recognized in the period during which the ad impressions are delivered. The Company reports revenue earned through
national advertising agreements either on a net or gross basis. The Company applies judgement in recognizing revenue earned through national
advertising agreements on a net or gross basis based on the criteria as disclosed below. 

Under
national advertising agreements wherein the Company does not bear inventory risk and only has credit risk on its portion of the revenue,
national advertising revenues are accounted for on a net basis and the publisher is identified as the customer. In select national advertising
agreements with its publishers, the Company takes on inventory risk and additional credit risk. Under these agreements, the Company either
a) provides the publisher with a guaranteed minimum gross selling price per advertising unit delivered, wherein the greater of the actual
selling price or guaranteed minimum selling price is used in determining the publisher s share or b) provides the publisher with
a fixed rate per advertising unit delivered, wherein the publisher is paid the fixed rate per advertising unit delivered irrespective
of the actual selling price. Under these national advertising agreements, national advertising revenues are accounted for on a gross
basis with the advertiser identified as the customer and the publisher identified as a supplier, with amounts billed to the advertiser
reported as revenue and amounts due to the publisher reported as a revenue sharing expense, within expenses. 

39 

Also
included in advertising revenue is advertising revenue generated by the Company s various owned and operated properties. 

Brand
Sponsorships 

The
Company offers advertisers a full range of promotional vehicles, including but not limited to online advertising, livestream announcements,
event content generation, social media posts, logo placement on the Company s official merchandise, and special appearances of
members of the Company s talent roster. The Company s brand sponsorship agreements may include multiple services that are
capable of being individually distinct; however the intended benefit is an association with the Company s brand, and the services
are not distinct within the context of the contracts. Revenues from brand sponsorship agreements are recognized ratably over the contract
term. Payment terms and conditions vary, but payments are generally due periodically throughout the term of the contract. In instances
where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of billing, management has determined the brand sponsorship agreements
generally do not include a significant financing component. 

Content 

The
Company and its talent roster generate and produce original content which the Company monetizes through Google s AdSense service.
Revenue is variable and is earned when the visitor views or clicks through on the advertisement. The amount of revenue
earned is reported to the Company monthly and is recognized upon receipt of the report of viewership activity. Payment terms and conditions
vary, but payments are generally due within 30 to 45 days after the end of each month. 

The
Company grants exclusive licenses to customers for certain content produced by the Company s talent. The Company grants the customer
a license to the intellectual property, which is the content and its use in generating advertising revenues, for a pre-determined period,
for an amount paid by the customer, in most instances, upon execution of the contract. The Company s only performance obligation
is to license the content for use in generating advertising revenues, and the Company recognizes the full contract amount at the point
at which the Company provides the customer access to the content, which is at the execution of the contract. The Company has no further
performance obligations under these types of contracts and does not anticipate generating any additional revenue from these arrangements
apart from the contract amount. 

Consumer
Products 

The
Company earns consumer products revenue from sales of the Company s consumer products on the Company s website or at live
or virtual events. Revenues are recognized at a point in time, as control is transferred to the customer upon shipment. The Company offers
customer returns and discounts through a third-party distributor and accounts for this as a reduction to revenue. The Company does not
offer loyalty programs or other sales incentive programs that are material to revenue recognition. Payment is due at the time of sale.
The Company has outsourced the design, manufacturing, fulfillment, distribution, and sale of the Company s consumer products to
a third party in exchange for royalties based on the amount of revenue generated. Management evaluated the terms of the agreement to
determine whether the Company s consumer products revenues should be reported gross or net of royalties paid. Key indicators that
management evaluated in determining whether the Company is the principal in the sale (gross reporting) or an agent (net reporting) include,
but are not limited to: 

the
 Company is the party that is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service, 

the
 Company has inventory risk before the good is transferred to the customer, and 

the
 Company is the party that has discretion in establishing pricing for the specified good or service. 

Based
on management s evaluation of the above indicators, the Company reports consumer products revenues on a gross basis. 

Esports 

League
Participation: Generally, The Company has one performance obligation to participate in the overall Esport event because
the underlying activities do not have standalone value absent the Company s participation in the tournament or event. Revenue from
prize winnings and profit-share agreements is variable and is highly uncertain. The Company recognizes revenue at the point in time when
the uncertainty is resolved. 

Player
Transfer Fees: Player transfer agreements include a fixed fee and may include a variable fee component. The Company recognizes the
fixed portion of revenue from transfer fees upon satisfaction of the Company s performance obligation, which coincides with the
execution of the related agreement. The variable portion of revenue is considered highly uncertain and is recognized at the point in
time when the uncertainty is resolved. 

Licensing
of Intellectual Property: The Company s licenses of intellectual property generate royalties that are recognized in accordance
with the royalty recognition constraint. That is, royalty revenue is recognized at the time when the sale occurs. 

The
Company assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. When
the Company acts in the capacity of an agent rather than as the principal in a transaction, the revenue recognized is the net amount
of commission made by the Company. 

Deferred
revenue consists of customer advances for Company services to be rendered that will be recognized as income in future periods. 

40 

Income
taxes 

Income
tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in profit or loss except
to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity. 

Current
tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at year
end, adjusted for amendments to tax payable with regards to previous years. 

Deferred
tax is provided using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary
differences: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business
combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates,
and jointly controlled entities to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax
provided is based on the expected manner of realization or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the financial position reporting date applicable to the period of expected realization or settlement. 

A
deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the
asset can be utilized. 

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and
liabilities on a net basis. 

Investments 

Investments
in and advances to entities or joint ventures in which the Company has significant influence, but less than a controlling financial interest,
are accounted for using the equity method. Significant influence is generally presumed to exist when the Company owns an interest between
20 and 50 and exercises significant influence. 

In
accordance with ASC 321 Investments Equity Securities ASC 321 ), equity securities which the
Company has no significant influence (generally less than a 20 ownership interest) with readily determinable fair values are accounted
for at fair value based on quoted market prices. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are accounted for either
at fair value or using the measurement alternative which is at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable
price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. All gains and losses on investments
in equity securities are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 

41 

Equity
securities accounted for under the measurement alternative, the Company assesses the securities for impairment indicators, at least annually,
or more frequently if there are any indicators of impairment. If the assessment indicates that the fair value of the investment is less
than its carrying value, the investment is impaired and an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related
fair value of the investment will be recorded. 

Business
combinations 

The
results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the
date of the acquisition. The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting and allocates the purchase price to the identifiable assets
and liabilities of the relevant acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. Any excess consideration over the fair value
of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price in a business combination
requires the Company to perform valuations with significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies,
estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. The Company engages the assistance
of valuation specialists in concluding on fair value measurements in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in a business combination. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date,
the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion
of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any
subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. Transaction costs associated with business combinations
are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Impairment
of long-lived assets and goodwill 

Long-lived
assets consist of property and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets. The Company assesses for impairment of asset groups,
including intangible assets, at least annually, or more frequently if there are any indicators for impairment. 

Goodwill
and indefinite life intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or when there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 

When
a triggering event that occurred during the reporting period is identified, or when the annual impairment test is required, the Company
may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If the Company determines
it is more likely than not that goodwill is not impaired, an impairment test is not necessary. If an impairment test is necessary, management
estimates the fair value of the Company. If the carrying value of the Company exceeds its fair value, goodwill is determined to be impaired,
and an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value of the Company will be recorded. If the
qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that goodwill is not impaired, further testing is unnecessary. 

Fair
value option for convertible debt 

The
Company elected the Fair Value Option FVO for recognition of its convertible debt as permitted under ASC 825, Financial
Instruments . Under the FVO, the Company recognizes the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.
The FVO may be applied instrument by instrument, but it is irrevocable. As a result of applying the FVO, any direct costs and fees related
to the convertible debt is recognized in operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as incurred
and not deferred. Changes in fair value of the convertible debt is recognized as a separate line in the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss. 

42 

Contingencies 

The
Company estimates loss contingencies in accordance with ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies , which states that a loss contingency shall
be accrued by a charge to income if both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available before the consolidated financial
statements are issued or are available to be issued indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and (ii) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management regularly evaluates current information
available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the
results of operations or financial condition of the Company including, without limitation, such considerations as liquidity and capital
resources. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations
are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our
condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments as of the
balance sheet date that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Our
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

See
Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of
recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, the timing of their
adoptions and our assessment, to the extent we have made one, of their potential impact on our financial condition and results of
operations. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The
Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required
under this Item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. Material weaknesses relating
to the Design and Implementation of Control Activities and Monitoring Activities were identified. The Company did not have sufficient
resources with the relevant expertise to perform an effective risk assessment process, design and implement controls supported by documentation
and provide evidence that such controls designed was based on the COSO Framework. 

The
material weaknesses in risk assessment, control activities and monitoring activities contributed to the following material weaknesses:
(i) the Company did not complete a documented risk assessment, and (ii) the Company did not identify all risks and design relevant controls
related to system of internal controls. As a consequence of the aggregation of the foregoing deficiencies in the Company s DC P
and ICFR design, the Company did not have effective control activities related to the design of process-level and management review control
activities. Aside from these deficiencies, management believes that the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024, present fairly in all material respects, the Company s financial position, results of operations,
changes in shareholders equity and cash flows in accordance with U.S GAAP. The Company does not believe and is not aware of any
circumstance in which the potential weaknesses have impacted the Company s financial reporting and as a result, there were no material
adjustments to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.
In addition, there were no changes to previously released financial results. However, if the collective deficiencies were deemed to create
a material weakness, a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements might not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Management s
Remediation Measures 

To
address the deficiencies identified, management, with oversight of the Audit Committee, has implemented, or will implement, remediation
measures to further address the deficiencies in the design of its DC P and ICFR. The Company intends to complete such remedial measures
by December 31, 2025. Management has also performed an initial risk assessment using a top-down, risk-based approach with respect to
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. In addition, compensating controls have been applied to
a number of areas where the risks of material misstatement are considered moderate to high. The Company is engaging outside resources
to strengthen the business process documentation and help with management s self-assessment and testing of internal controls. Although
the Company can give no assurance that these actions will remediate these deficiencies or that additional deficiencies or a material
weaknesses will not be identified in the future, management believes the foregoing efforts will, when implemented, strengthen our DC P
and ICFR. Management will take additional remedial actions as necessary as they continue to evaluate and work to improve the Company s
control environment. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The
Company is subject, from time to time, to various legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of its business. 

In
April 2020, Engine announced its renegotiation of the acquisition of Allinsports. The revised purchase agreement provided for the acquisition
of 100 of Allinsports in exchange for the issuance of 241,666 common shares of the Engine and other considerations, including payments
of 1,200,000 as a portion of the purchase consideration. In September 2020, Engine advised the shareholders of Allinsports that closing
conditions of the transaction, including the requirement to provide audited financial statements, had not been satisfied. 

In
response, in November 2020, the shareholders of Allinsports commenced arbitration in Alberta, Canada seeking, among other things, to
compel Engine to complete the acquisition of Allinsports without the audited financial statements, and to issue 241,666 common shares
of Engine to those shareholders. As alternative relief, the shareholders of Allinsports sought up to 20.0 million in damages. A hearing
in this matter was held in May of 2021, and by a decision dated September 30, 2021, the Arbitrator determined that the closing of the
transaction had previously occurred and directed Engine to issue 241,666 common shares. In conjunction with completion of the Arrangement
(see Note 4), the Company assumed this obligation to issue 241,666 common shares. The Company is pursuing regulatory approval to issue
the shares and is also pursuing relief against Allinsports shareholders for various alleged breaches of the share purchase agreement.
The Company recognized a liability for the arbitration ruling of 1.5 million, which represented the fair value of the common shares
directed to be delivered as of April 11, 2023, the closing date of the Arrangement. The liability is recorded as arbitration reserve
on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. This liability will be adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period. 

By
Order to Continue dated May 5, 2022, Engine was substituted in as the plaintiff in a matter pending in the Ontario Superior Court of
Justice, seeking recovery of 2.1 million 1.9 million) of principal and additional amounts of accrued interest under promissory
notes acquired by Engine. The matter is in the discovery stage. 

On June 21, 2024, the Company received a notice from
King Street Partners LLC King Street ), the holder of a 12.75 Convertible Senior Secured Note with a principal amount of
 5,800,000 dated December 29, 2023. The notice objected to the Company s ability to maintain its 51 economic interest in FaZe Media,
Inc. and other related matters. 

As a result, King Street requested the immediate repayment
of the full principal amount, along with any premiums and accrued interest. 

On October 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Settlement
and Release Agreement with King Street pertaining to the King Street Note. 

The
outcomes of pending litigations in which the Company is involved are necessarily uncertain as are the Company s expenses in prosecuting
and defending these actions. From time to time the Company may modify litigation strategy and/or the terms on which it retains counsel
and other professionals in connection with such actions, which may affect the outcomes of and/or the expenses incurred in connection
with such actions. 

44 

The
Company is subject to various other claims, lawsuits and other complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company records
provisions for losses when claims become probable, and the amounts are estimable. Although the outcome of such matters cannot be determined,
it is the opinion of management that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s
financial condition, operations, or liquidity.
