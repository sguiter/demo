As
a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information
required by this Item. 

Item
4 Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer,
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2024. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls
and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting, our chief executive
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The matters involving internal controls and procedures
that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (i)
lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors
on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
(ii) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (iii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting
and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. The aforementioned material
weaknesses were identified by our chief executive officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of October 31,
2024. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management s review and approval
of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that: 

1. 
 pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

2. 
 provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management; and 

3. 
 provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing
of the operational effectiveness of these controls. 

As
of October 31, 2024, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in 2013 and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments.
Based on such evaluation, the Company s management concluded that, during the period covered by this Report, our internal control
over financial reporting were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended October 31, 2024, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
