Delayed Draw Term Loan In September 2022 , the Company entered into a million unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan with an increase option of up to million (the 2022 Delayed Draw Term Loan ). Proceeds of the 2022 Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement may be used (a) to pay off in full, or partially payoff, the Company s existing Senior Notes, (b) to prepay revolving loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement (as defined below), or (c) for working capital, capital expenditures and other lawful corporate purposes. The Company drew million from the 2022 Delayed Draw Term Loan in November 2022. The Company incurred million of debt issuance costs in connection with the delayed draw term loan. These costs are presented as a direct deduction from long-term debt on the face of the balance sheet. Interest expense related to the Delayed Draw Term Loan for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were million and million, respectively and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense is recorded in Interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there was million outstanding under the Delayed Draw Term Loan. The 2022 Delayed Draw Term Loan has a maturity and permits the Company to borrow in U.S. dollars. The 2022 Delayed Draw Term Loan does not require any amortization payments by the Company. Depending on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio (or debt rating after such time as the Company has such rating), borrowings under the 2022 Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement will bear interest at either an adjusted Term SOFR benchmark rate plus a margin between and or a base rate plus a margin of between and and will initially bear interest at the middle of this range. The Company will pay a ticking fee on unused term loan commitments at a rate of commencing with the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. Amounts outstanding under the 2022 Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement may be prepaid at the option of the Company without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage fees in connection with the prepayment of benchmark rate loans. The interest rates on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were and , respectively. Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 In August 2020, the Company issued an aggregate million of Convertible Senior Notes due 2025, including the exercise of a million initial purchasers option. The Company received proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Convertible Senior Notes of million, net of million of transaction fees and other third-party offering expenses. per annum, payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning on February 15, 2021 , and will mature on , unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The Convertible Senior Notes are the Company s senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company s secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company s subsidiaries

of principal of the Notes will initially be convertible into shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. On or after March 15, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Convertible Senior Notes, holders may convert all or a portion of their Convertible Senior Notes, regardless of the conditions below. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2025, the Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders thereof only under the following circumstances: during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2021, if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock for at least trading days, whether or not consecutive, during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; 

 during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which, for each trading day of that period, the trading price per principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes for such trading day was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; 

 if the Company calls such Convertible Senior Notes for redemption; or 

 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events described in the Indenture. 

 The Company may redeem all or any portion of the Convertible Senior Notes for cash, at its option, on or after August 21, 2023 and before the st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company s common stock exceeds of the conversion price for a specified period of time. In addition, calling any Convertible Senior Note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that Convertible Senior Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Convertible Senior Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Senior Notes, holders of the Convertible Senior Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the Convertible Senior Notes for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Upon conversion, the Company may settle the Convertible Senior Notes for cash, shares of the Company s common stock, or a combination thereof, at the Company s option. If the Company satisfies its conversion obligation solely in cash or through payment and delivery of a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock, the amount of cash and shares of common stock due upon conversion will be based on a daily conversion value calculated on a proportionate basis for each trading day in a 50-trading day observation period. The Company recognized interest expense of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respe ctively and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , respectively. The net, carrying value of the Convertible Senior Notes were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See the discussion of the partial repurchase of Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 and the unwind of the related note hedge and warrants below. Note Hedge and Warrant - Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 In connection with the sale of the Convertible Senior Notes, the Company purchased a bond hedge designed to mitigate the potential dilution from the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes. Under the term of the bond hedge, upon a conversion of the bonds, the Company will receive the number of shares of common stock equal to the remaining common stock deliverable upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes if the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the Notes. The aggregate number of shares that the Company could be obligated to issue upon

million shares. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was million. The cost of the convertible note hedge was partially offset by the Company s sale of warrants to acquire approximately million shares of the Company s common stock. The warrants were initially exercisable at a price of at least per share and are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the payment of dividends. The Company received million in cash proceeds from the sales of these warrants. The bond hedge and warrant transactions effectively increased the conversion price associated with the Convertible Senior Notes during the term of these transactions from , or , to , or , at their issuance, thereby reducing the dilutive economic effect to shareholders upon actual conversion. The bond hedges and warrants are indexed to, and potentially settled in, shares of the Company s common stock. The net cost of million for the purchase of the bond hedges and sale of the warrants was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. At issuance, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of million related to the Convertible Senior Notes debt discount and the capitalized debt issuance costs. The Company also recorded a deferred tax asset of million related to the convertible note hedge transactions and the tax basis of the capitalized debt issuance costs through additional paid-in capital. The deferred tax liability and deferred tax asset were included net in Deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company reversed the deferred tax liability of million that the Company had recorded at issuance related to the Convertible Senior Note debt discount and recorded an additional deferred tax liability of million related to the capitalized debt issuance costs. In addition, the Company recorded a million adjustment to the deferred tax asset through retained earnings related to the tax effect of book accretion recorded in 2020 and reversed upon adoption. Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 In February 2024, the Company issued an aggregate million of Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Convertible Notes ), including the exercise of a million initial purchasers option in full. The Company received proceeds from the issuance and sale of the 2029 Convertible Notes of million, net of million of transaction fees and other third-party offering expenses. per annum, payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on September 1, 2024 , and will mature on , unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The 2029 Convertible Notes are the Company s senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2029 Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company s secured indebtedness, including borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan credit facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company s subsidiaries. Each of principal of the 2029 Convertible Notes will initially be convertible into shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. On or after October 1, 2028 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2029 Convertible Notes, holders may convert all or a portion of their 2029 Convertible Notes, regardless of the conditions below. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 1, 2028, the 2029 Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders thereof only under the following circumstances: during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2024, if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock for at least trading days, whether or not consecutive, during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; 

20 

principal amount of 2029 Convertible Notes for such trading day was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; 

 if the Company calls such 2029 Convertible Notes for redemption; or 

 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events described in the Indenture. 

 The Company may redeem all or any portion of the 2029 Convertible Notes for cash, at its option, on or after March 8, 2027 and before the st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the 2029 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company s common stock exceeds of the conversion price for a specified period of time. In addition, calling any 2029 Convertible Notes for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that 2029 Convertible Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that 2029 Convertible Notes will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change prior to the maturity date of the 2029 Convertible Notes, holders of the 2029 Convertible Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2029 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the 2029 Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Upon conversion, the Company will settle the principal amount of the 2029 Convertible Notes converted in cash and will settle the remainder of the consideration owed upon conversion in cash, shares of the Company s common stock, or a combination thereof, at the Company s option, with such amount of cash and, if applicable, shares of common stock due upon conversion based on a daily conversion value calculated on a proportionate basis for each trading day in a 50-trading day observation period. The Company recognized interest expense with respect to the 2029 Convertible Notes of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , the net, carrying value of the 2029 Convertible Notes was million. Capped Call Transactions - Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 In February 2024, in connection with the offering of the 2029 Convertible Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions (the Capped Call Transactions with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company s common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted Convertible Senior Notes due 2029, as the case may be. If, however, the market price per share of the Company s common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is initially per share, which represents a premium of over the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock of per share on the New York Stock Exchange on February 21, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. The cost of million for the Capped Call Transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. At issuance, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset of million related to the Capped Call Transactions costs through additional paid-in capital. The deferred tax asset was included in Deferred tax assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 Partial Repurchase and Note Hedge and Warrants Partial Unwind In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2029, during the first quarter of 2024, we used million of the net proceeds to purchase approximately million aggregate principal amount of 

 21 

million to settle the repurchase of approximately million aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 in a separately negotiated transaction that settled in March 2024. We also received approximately million in cash from the note hedge counterparties for the partial termination of the existing bond hedge relating to the Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 repurchased, net of our obligations to the counterparties in connection with the partial termination of the related warrant transactions. The tax effect of million from the partial unwind of the existing bond hedge was recognized as a reduction in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. The income tax payable was included in Income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets. The partial repurchase, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted in a million loss on debt extinguishment which includes a million charge to interest expense for the acceleration of the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the Convertible Senior Notes due 2025. The tax effect of the debt extinguishment, excluding the interest expense, was recognized as a discrete event to the quarter giving rise to an increase in the effective tax rate and tax benefit of million recognized in the income statement. Revolving Credit Facility In June 2021 , the Company entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement ). The Company incurred million of costs in connection with this Credit Agreement. The 2021 Credit Agreement replaced an existing Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 15, 2017. Under the new agreement, the Company s revolving credit facility was increased from million to million. The credit facility has a maturity, which may be extended up to times for periods determined by the Company and the applicable extending lenders, and permits the Company to borrow in U.S. dollars, certain specified foreign currencies, and each other currency that may be approved in accordance with the 2021 Facility. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either the Term SOFR rate plus a margin between and or a base rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin of between and . The rates on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were and , respectively. Borrowings under this Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain Company operating subsidiaries. Letters of credit commitments outstanding under this agreement aggregated to million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which reduced borrowing limits available to the Company. Interest expense related to the Credit Agreement was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 . There were loan amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024. The Credit Agreement includes various covenants, including restrictions on indebtedness, liens, acquisitions, investments or dispositions, payment of dividends and maintenance of certain financial ratios and conditions. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Letters of Credit The Company also has in place several secondary bank credit lines for issuing letters of credit, principally for foreign contracts, to support performance and completion guarantees. Letters of credit commitments outstanding under these bank lines aggregated approximately million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 

 minimum level of tax regardless of where the MNE operates. The OECD has released its fourth round of administrative guidance in June 2024. Many non-US tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in 2024 and/or have announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. The Company has evaluated the implementation of Pillar Two on its 2024 income tax position based on currently enacted legislation and has determined there is no material impact. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two Framework, pending enactment of legislation by individual countries. The Company s effective tax rate was and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to unfavorable impact of a 

 22 

and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The change in effective tax rate was due primarily to the tax benefit resulting from the million loss in partially unwinding Convertible Senior Notes during the first quarter 2024. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate of for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relates to a change in jurisdictional earnings partially resulting from a loss in partially unwinding Convertible Senior Notes, the FDII deduction, equity based compensation, and untaxed income attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by rate impacts related to state income taxes, and foreign withholding taxes. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s deferred tax assets were subject to a valuation allowance of million primarily related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax credit carryforwards, reserves and capital losses that the Company has determined are not more-likely-than-not to be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include: the past performance of the entities, forecasts of future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. The ability or failure to achieve the forecasted taxable income in these entities could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was million and million, respectively. It is reasonably possible that the Company may realize a decrease in our uncertain tax positions of approximately million during the next 12 months as a result of concluding various tax audits and closing tax years. Although the Company believes its reserves for its tax positions are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits could be materially different, both favorably and unfavorably. It is reasonably possible that certain audits may conclude in the next 12 months and that the unrecognized tax benefits the Company has recorded in relation to these tax years may change compared to the liabilities recorded for these periods. 

 claims or assessments outstanding which would materially affect the consolidated results of operations or the Company s financial position. In September 2015, a former Parsons employee filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama against us as a qui tam relator on behalf of the United States (the Relator alleging violation of the False Claims Act. The plaintiff alleges that, as a result of these actions, the United States paid in excess of million per month between February and September 2006 that it should have paid to another contractor, plus million to acquire vehicles for the contractor defendant to perform its security services. The lawsuit sought (i) that we cease and desist from violating the False Claims Act, (ii) monetary damages equal to three times the amount of damages that the United States has sustained because of our alleged violations, plus a civil penalty of not less than and not more than for each alleged violation of the False Claims Act, (iii) monetary damages equal to the maximum amount allowed pursuant to 3730(d) of the False Claims Act, and (iv) Relator s costs for this action, including recovery of attorneys fees and costs incurred in the lawsuit. The United States government did not intervene in this matter as it is allowed to do so under the statute. The court heard dispositive motions in 2023, including Parsons motion for summary judgment. We are awaiting the court s rulings upon such motions, which will determine whether a trial will be necessary for this matter in 2024 or 2025.

million in favor of Parsons Transportation Group, Inc. and against Alstom Signaling Operations LLC (Alstom"). This proposed award relates back to a lawsuit Parsons initially filed against the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board for breach of contract and wrongful termination in February 2017 (which was settled between Parsons and the Joint Powers Board in 2021) and a cross-complaint filed against Alstom Signaling Operations LLC in November 2017, as subsequently amended, for breach of contract, negligence and intentional misrepresentation. On September 23, 2024, the Court awarded pre-judgment interest in the amount of million and amended the judgment accordingly to include such interest amount. Alstom filed its notice of appeal of the amended judgment on September 23, 2024 and has posted a bond. At this time, the Company is unable to determine the probability of the outcome of the litigation. Federal government contracts are subject to audits, which are performed for the most part by the Defense Contract Audit Agency DCAA ). Audits by the DCAA and other agencies consist of reviews of our overhead rates, operating systems and cost proposals to ensure that we account for such costs in accordance with the Cost Accounting Standards CAS ). If the DCAA determines we have not accounted for such costs in accordance with the CAS, the DCAA may disallow these costs. The disallowance of such costs may result in a reduction of revenue and additional liability for the Company. Historically, the Company has not experienced any material disallowed costs as a result of government audits. However, the Company can provide no assurance that the DCAA or other government audits will not result in material disallowances for incurred costs in the future. All audits of costs incurred on work performed through 2018 have been closed, and years thereafter remain open. Although there can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved favorably, management believes that their ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Total liabilities at fair value 

Contingent consideration is recorded at its fair value, using a Black-Scholes model, within other liabilities or other long-term liabilities, as appropriate. The fair value of contingent consideration involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to risks associated with earnout, i.e. risk in the underlying metric, risk in the earnout structure, counterparty credit risk, projected revenue, the revenue discount rate, the revenue volatility, and the Company's credit adjusted discount rate. Subsequent adjustments to these assumptions can cause changes to the measure of contingent consideration. Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a more complete discussion of the various items within the consolidated financial statements measured at fair value and the methods used to determine fair value.

 Overview 
 We are a leading provider of the integrated solutions and services required in today s complex security environment and a world of digital transformation. We deliver innovative technology-driven solutions to customers worldwide. We have developed significant expertise and differentiated capabilities in key areas of cybersecurity, intelligence, missile defense, C5ISR, space, transportation, water/wastewater and environmental remediation. By combining our talented team of professionals and advanced technology, we solve complex technical challenges to enable a safer, smarter, more secure and more connected world. 
 We operate in two reporting segments, Federal Solutions and Critical Infrastructure. Our Federal Solutions business provides advanced technical solutions to the U.S. government. Our Critical Infrastructure business provides integrated engineering and management services for complex physical and digital infrastructure to state and local governments and large companies. 
 Our employees provide services pursuant to contracts that we are awarded by the customer and specific task orders relating to such contracts. These contracts are often multi-year, which provides us backlog and visibility on our revenues for future periods. Many of our contracts and task orders are subject to renewal and rebidding at the end of their term, and some are subject to the exercise of contract options and issuance of task orders by the applicable government 
 33 

entity. In addition to focusing on increasing our revenues through increased contract awards and backlog, we focus our financial performance on margin expansion and cash flow. 
 Key Metrics 
 We manage and assess the performance of our business by evaluating a variety of metrics. The following table sets forth selected key metrics (in thousands, except Book-to-Bill):

(1) Difference between our backlog of 8.8 billion and our remaining unsatisfied performance obligations, or RUPO, of 6.7 billion, each as of September 30, 2024, is due to (i) unissued task orders and unexercised option years, to the extent their issuance or exercise is probable, as well as (ii) contract awards, to the extent we believe contract execution and funding is probable. 

Awards 
 Awards generally represent the amount of revenue expected to be earned in the future from funded and unfunded contract awards received during the period. Contract awards include both new and re-compete contracts and task orders. Given that new contract awards generate growth, we closely track our new awards each year. 
 The following table summarizes the year to-date value of new awards for the periods presented below (in thousands):

4,748,320 

The change in new awards from year to year is primarily due to ordinary course fluctuations in our business. The volume of contract awards can fluctuate in any given period due to win rate and the timing and size of the awards issued by our customers. 
 The increase in awards for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period last year was primarily due to two significant awards in our Federal Solutions segment and a design award in our Critical Infrastructure segment. 
 The increase in awards for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the corresponding period last year was primarily due to significant option period awards from a customer in our Federal Solutions segment offset by significant awards in our Federal Solutions segment from the Federal Aviation Administration and the General Services Administration for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Backlog 
 We define backlog to include the following two components: 
 Funded Funded backlog represents future revenue anticipated from orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized. 

Unfunded Unfunded backlog represents future revenue anticipated from orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized. 

Backlog includes (i) unissued task orders and unexercised option years, to the extent their issuance or exercise is probable, as well as (ii) contract awards, to the extent we believe contract execution and funding is probable.

(1) Difference between our backlog of 8.8 billion and our RUPO of 6.7 billion, each as of September 30, 2024, is due to (i) unissued task orders and unexercised option years, to the extent their issuance or exercise is probable, as well as (ii) contract awards, to the extent we believe contract execution and funding is probable. 

Our backlog includes orders under contracts that in some cases extend for several years. For example, the U.S. Congress generally appropriates funds for our U.S. federal government customers on a yearly basis, even though their contracts with us may call for performance that is expected to take a number of years to complete. As a result, our federal contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term. All or some of the work to be performed under the contracts may remain unfunded unless and until the U.S. Congress makes subsequent appropriations and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract. 
 We expect to recognize 3.9 billion of our funded backlog at September 30, 2024 as revenues in the following twelve months. However, our U.S. federal government customers may cancel their contracts with us at any time through a termination for convenience or may elect to not exercise option periods under such contracts. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would not receive anticipated future revenues, but would generally be permitted to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed. See Risk Factors Risk Relating to Our Business We may not realize the full value of our backlog, which may result in lower than expected revenue in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The changes in backlog in both the Federal Solutions and Critical Infrastructure segments were primarily from ordinary course fluctuations in our business and the impacts related to the Company s awards discussed above. 
 Book-to-Bill 
 Book-to-bill is the ratio of total awards to total revenue recorded in the same period. Our management believes our book-to-bill ratio is a useful indicator of our potential future revenue growth in that it measures the rate at which we are generating new awards compared to the Company s current revenue. To drive future revenue growth, our goal is for the level of awards in a given period to exceed the revenue booked. A book-to-bill ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that awards generated in a given period exceeded the revenue recognized in the same period, while a book-to-bill ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that awards generated in such period were less than the revenue recognized in such period. The following table sets forth the book-to-bill ratio for the periods presented below:

Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 We believe that the financial performance of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors, including those highlighted in this section. Our operating performance will depend upon many variables, including the success of our growth strategies and the timing and size of investments and expenditures that we choose to undertake, as well as market growth and other factors that are not within our control. 
 35 

Government Spending 
 Changes in the relative mix of government spending and areas of spending growth, with shifts in priorities on homeland security, intelligence, defense-related programs, infrastructure and urbanization, and continued increased spending on technology and innovation, including cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, connected communities and physical infrastructure, could impact our business and results of operations. Cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives, current and future budget restrictions, spending cuts and other efforts to reduce government spending could cause our government customers to reduce or delay funding or invest appropriated funds on a less consistent basis or not at all, and demand for our solutions or services could diminish. Furthermore, any disruption in the functioning of government agencies, including as a result of government closures and shutdowns, could have a negative impact on our operations and cause us to lose revenue or incur additional costs due to, among other things, our inability to deploy our staff to customer locations or facilities as a result of such disruptions. 
 Federal Budget Uncertainty 
 There is uncertainty around the timing, extent, nature and effect of Congressional and other U.S. government actions to address budgetary constraints, caps on the discretionary budget for defense and non-defense departments and agencies, and the ability of Congress to determine how to allocate the available budget authority and pass appropriations bills to fund both U.S. government departments and agencies that are, and those that are not, subject to the caps. Additionally, budget deficits and the growing U.S. national debt increase pressure on the U.S. government to reduce federal spending across all federal agencies, with uncertainty about the size and timing of those reductions. Furthermore, delays in the completion of future U.S. government budgets could in the future delay procurement of the federal government services we provide. A reduction in the amount of, or delays, or cancellations of funding for, services that we are contracted to provide to the U.S. government as a result of any of these impacts or related initiatives, legislation or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Regulations 
 Increased audit, review, investigation and general scrutiny by government agencies of performance under government contracts and compliance with the terms of those contracts and applicable laws could affect our operating results. Negative publicity and increased scrutiny of government contractors in general, including us, relating to government expenditures for contractor services and incidents involving the mishandling of sensitive or classified information, as well as the increasingly complex requirements of the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Intelligence Community, including those related to cybersecurity, could impact our ability to perform in the markets we serve. 
 Competitive Markets 
 The industries we operate in consist of a large number of enterprises ranging from small, niche-oriented companies to multi-billion-dollar corporations that serve many government and commercial customers. We compete on the basis of our technical expertise, technological innovation, our ability to deliver cost-effective multi-faceted services in a timely manner, our reputation and relationships with our customers, qualified and/or security-clearance personnel, and pricing. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the markets in which we operate because of our proven track record, long-term customer relationships, technology innovation, scalable and agile business offerings and world class talent. Our ability to effectively deliver on project engagements and successfully assist our customers affects our ability to win new contracts and drives our financial performance. 
 Acquired Operations 
 BlackSignal Technologies, LLC 
 On August 16, 2024, the Company acquired a 100 ownership interest in BlackSignal Technologies, LLC, ("BlackSignal") a privately-owned company, for 203.8 million from cash on hand. Headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia, BlackSignal is a next-generation digital signal processing, electronic warfare, and cyber security provider built to counter near peer threats.

The financial results of SealingTech have been included in our consolidated results of operations from August 23, 2023 onward. 
 IPKeys Power Partners 
 On April 13, 2023, the Company entered into a merger agreement to acquire a 100 ownership interest in IPKeys Power Partners IPKeys ), a privately-owned company, for 43.0 million. The merger brings IPKeys' established customer base, expanding Parsons' presence in two rapidly growing end markets: grid modernization and cyber resiliency for critical infrastructure. Headquartered in Tinton Falls, New Jersey, IPKeys is a trusted provider of enterprise software platform solutions that is actively delivering cyber and operational security to hundreds of electric, water, and gas utilities across North America. The financial results of IPKeys have been included in our consolidated results of operations from April 13, 2023 onward. 
 Seasonality 
 Our results may be affected by variances as a result of weather conditions and contract award seasonality impacts that we experience across our businesses. The latter issue is typically driven by the U.S. federal government fiscal year-end, September 30. While not certain, it is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award task orders or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of the U.S. federal government fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended U.S. federal government fiscal year funds. In addition, we have also historically experienced higher bid and proposal costs in the months leading up to the U.S. federal government fiscal year-end as we pursue new contract opportunities expected to be awarded early in the following U.S. federal government fiscal year as a result of funding appropriated for that U.S. federal government fiscal year. Furthermore, many U.S. state governments with fiscal years ending on June 30 tend to accelerate spending during their first quarter, when new funding becomes available. We may continue to experience this seasonality in future periods, and our results of operations may be affected by it. 
 Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Our revenue consists of both services provided by our employees and pass-through fees from subcontractors and other direct costs. Our Federal Solutions segment derives revenue primarily from the U.S. federal government and our Critical Infrastructure segment derives revenue primarily from government and commercial customers. 
 We enter into the following types of contracts with our customers: 
 Under cost-plus contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable or otherwise defined costs incurred, plus a fee. The contracts may also include incentives for various performance criteria, including quality, timeliness, safety and cost-effectiveness. In addition, costs are generally subject to review by clients and regulatory audit agencies, and such reviews could result in costs being disputed as non-reimbursable under the terms of the contract. 

Under time-and-materials contracts, hourly billing rates are negotiated and charged to clients based on the actual time spent on a project. In addition, clients reimburse actual out-of-pocket costs for other direct costs and expenses that are incurred in connection with the performance under the contract. 

Under fixed-price contracts, clients pay an agreed fixed-amount negotiated in advance for a specified scope of work.

The amount of risk and potential reward varies under each type of contract. Under cost-plus contracts, there is limited financial risk, because we are reimbursed for all allowable costs up to a ceiling. However, profit margins on this type of contract tend to be lower than on time-and-materials and fixed-price contracts. Under time-and-materials contracts, we are reimbursed for the hours worked using the predetermined hourly rates for each labor category. In addition, we are typically reimbursed for other direct contract costs and expenses at cost. We assume financial risk on time-and-materials contracts because our labor costs may exceed the negotiated billing rates. Profit margins on well-managed time-and-materials contracts tend to be higher than profit margins on cost-plus contracts as long as we are able to staff those contracts with people who have an appropriate skill set. Under fixed-price contracts, we are required to deliver the objectives under the contract for a pre-determined price. Compared to time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts, fixed-price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities because we receive the full benefit of any cost savings, but they also generally involve greater financial risk because we bear the risk of any cost overruns. In the aggregate, the contract type mix in our revenue for any given period will affect that period s profitability. Over time, we have generally experienced a relatively stable contract mix. 
 The significant change in the contract mix for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period last year relates to increased business volume from a significant fixed price contract in our Federal Solutions segment. 
 Our recognition of profit on long-term contracts requires the use of assumptions related to transaction price and total cost of completion. Estimates are continually evaluated as work progresses and are revised when necessary. When a change in estimated cost or transaction price is determined to have an impact on contract profit, we record a positive or negative adjustment to the consolidated statement of income. 
 Joint Ventures 
 We conduct a portion of our business through joint ventures or similar partnership arrangements. For the joint ventures we control, we consolidate all the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income (including revenues and expenses attributable to noncontrolling interests). For the joint ventures we do not control, we recognize equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures. Our revenues included amounts related to services we provided to our unconsolidated joint ventures for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 of 47.6 million and 57.3 million, respectively, and 144.9 million and 164.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Operating costs and expenses 
 Operating costs and expenses primarily include direct costs of contracts and selling, general and administrative expenses. Costs associated with compensation-related expenses for our people and facilities, which includes ESOP contribution expenses, are the most significant component of our operating expenses. Total ESOP contribution expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 13.2 million and 14.9 million, respectively, and 43.4 million and 44.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively and is recorded in Direct cost of contracts and Selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 Direct costs of contracts consist of direct labor and associated fringe benefits, indirect overhead, subcontractor and materials pass-through costs ), travel expenses and other expenses incurred to perform on contracts. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A include salaries and wages and fringe benefits of our employees not performing work directly for customers, facility costs and other costs related to these indirect functions.

Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our operating performance used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. We discuss Adjusted EBITDA because our management uses this measure for business planning purposes, including to manage the business against internal projected results of operations and measure the performance of the business generally. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measure of our financial performance or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as measures of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Parsons Corporation, adjusted to include net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and to exclude interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These other items include, among other things, impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets, interest and other expenses recognized on litigation matters, expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and other non-recurring transaction costs and expenses related to our corporate restructuring initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management s discretionary use, as it does not reflect tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future, including, among other things, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 495.6 million in cash to repurchase 284.6 million aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the "Repurchase Transaction") concurrently with the offering of 2.625 Convertible Senior Notes due 2029. As a result of the Repurchase Transaction, we incurred a 211.0 million loss on debt extinguishment. The Repurchase Transaction is a partial repurchase of our Convertible Senior Notes due 2025. See Note 10 Debt and Credit Facilities, for a further discussion of this transaction . 
 Interest income is related to interest earned on investments in government money funds. The increase in interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is from higher cash balances held and increased interest rates compared to the corresponding periods last year. 
 Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to debt related to our Convertible Senior Notes and Delayed Draw Term Loan. The increase in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods last year is primarily related to an increase in debt balances. The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period last year is primarily related to an increase in debt balances and a 3.2 million charge from the acceleration of the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the partial repurchase of the 0.25 Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 discussed above. 
 The amounts in other income (expense), net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are primarily related to transaction gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and sublease income and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are primarily related to transaction gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, sublease income, and a change in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration.

The increase in tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period last year was due primarily to the tax impact of an increase in pre-tax income, a remeasurement of its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in state tax rate, a net increase of uncertain tax positions, and an increase in executive compensation subject to Section 162(m), partially offset by the increases in the foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deduction and equity-based compensation.

 Segment Results 
 We evaluate segment operating performance using segment revenue and segment Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation is Adjusted EBITDA excluding Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. Presented above, in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, is a discussion of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, how we use this metric, why we present this metric and the material limitations on the usefulness of this metric. See Note 18 Segments Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for further discussion regarding our segment Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation.

The increase in Critical Infrastructure revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period last year was primarily related to organic growth of 13 . The increase in organic growth was primarily due to the factors noted above for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 45 

The increase in Critical Infrastructure Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parsons Corporation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period last year was primarily due to the increase in organic revenue noted above and a reduction in selling general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These increases were offset by a contract write-down and the write-down in equity in losses from unconsolidated joint ventures discussed above. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included earnings on higher margin change orders which did not reoccur for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We currently finance our operations and capital expenditures through a combination of internally generated cash from operations, our Convertible Senior Notes, Delayed Draw Term Loan and periodic borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Generally, cash provided by operating activities has been adequate to fund our operations. Due to fluctuations in our cash flows and growth in our operations, it may be necessary from time to time in the future to borrow under our Credit Agreement to meet cash demands. Our management regularly monitors certain liquidity measures to monitor performance. We calculate our available liquidity as a sum of cash and cash equivalents from our consolidated balance sheet plus the amount available and unutilized on our Credit Agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations, support our debt service and our ongoing acquisition strategy for at least the next twelve months based on the liquidity from cash provided by our operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on-hand and our borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility. Management continually monitors debt maturities to strategically execute optimal terms and ensure appropriate levels of working capital liquidity are maintained for the Company. 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of revenue recognized, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customers. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including whether the contract type is cost-plus, time-and-materials, or fixed-price. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-plus and time-and-materials contracts, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. In contrast, we may be limited to bill certain fixed-price contracts only when specified milestones, including deliveries, are achieved. A number of our contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash prior to completing the work. 
 Billed accounts receivable represents amounts billed to clients that have not been collected. Unbilled accounts receivable represents amounts where the Company has a present contractual right to bill but an invoice has not been issued to the customer at the period-end date. 
 Accounts receivable is the principal component of our working capital and includes billed and unbilled amounts. The total amount of our accounts receivable can vary significantly over time but is generally sensitive to revenue levels. We experience delays in collections from time to time from Middle East customers. Net days sales outstanding, which we refer to as Net DSO, is calculated by dividing (i) (accounts receivable plus contract assets) less (contract liabilities plus accounts payable) by (ii) average revenue per day (calculated by dividing trailing twelve months revenue by the number of days in that period). We focus on collecting outstanding receivables to reduce Net DSO and working capital. Net DSO was 51 days at September 30, 2024 down from 65 days at September 30, 2023. Our working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was 905.1 million at September 30, 2024 and 726.6 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents increased by 285.9 million to 558.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 272.9 million at December 31, 2023.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for noncash items, such as: equity in losses (earnings) of unconsolidated joint ventures, contributions of treasury stock, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets, and provisions for doubtful accounts. The timing between the conversion of our billed and unbilled receivables into cash from our customers and disbursements to our employees and vendors is the primary driver of changes in our working capital. Our operating cash flows are primarily affected by our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner, our ability to manage our vendor payments and the overall profitability of our contracts. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 179.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver of the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was an 172.6 million increase in net income after adjusting for non-cash items and debt extinguishment offset by an increase in cash outflows from our working capital accounts of 30.0 million (primarily from accounts receivable, contract assets, prepaid expenses and other assets, and accounts payable offset by, contract liabilities, income taxes, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities) offset by a 23.3 change in cash used for other long-term liabilities. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, joint ventures and business acquisitions. 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased 17.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. was primarily related to a 33.8 million increase in investments in unconsolidated joint ventures offset in part by a decrease of 16.6 million in payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities is primarily associated with proceeds from debt, the repayment thereof, and distributions to noncontrolling interests. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased 181.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash flows from financing activities is primarily driven by net cash inflows from our convertible bond transactions which generated 287.4 million in cash. See Note 10 Debt and Credit Facilities, for a further discussion of these transactions. This increase was offset in part by net repayments of borrowings under the credit agreement of 75 million. 
 Letters of Credit 
 We have in place several secondary bank credit lines for issuing letters of credit, principally for foreign contracts, to support performance and completion guarantees. Letters of credit commitments outstanding under these bank lines aggregated to 309.1 million as of September 30, 2024. Letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement total 43.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See the information set forth in Note 3 New Accounting Pronouncements in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 47 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risks related to the Company s Revolving Credit Facility and Delayed Draw Term Loan. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility effective June 2021 bear interest at either the Term SOFR rate plus a margin between 1.0 and 1.625 , or a base rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin of between 0 and 0.625 , both based on the leverage ratio of the Company at the end of each quarter. The rates on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 6.2 and 6.7 , respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was 350.0 million outstanding under the Delayed Draw Term Loan. Borrowings under the 2022 Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement will bear interest at either an adjusted Term SOFR benchmark rate plus a margin between 0.875 and 1.500 or a base rate plus a margin of between 0 and 0.500 and will initially bear interest at the middle of this range. The Company will pay a ticking fee on unused term loan commitments at a rate of 0.175 commencing with the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. The interest rate on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 6.1 and 6.6 , respectively. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from our operations outside of the U.S. We limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of our contracts through provisions that require client payments in currencies corresponding to the currency in which costs are incurred. As a result of this natural hedge, we generally do not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Control and Procedures 
 Our management carried out, as of September 30, 2024, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the third quarter of 2024, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 The information required by this Item 1 is included in Note 12 Contingencies included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors. 
 There has been one addition to our Risk Factors disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The additional risk factor is presented below: 
 Risk Factors: 
 Parsons Government Services, Inc. has a contract with a confidential federal government client which constitutes material revenue in our Federal Solutions business segment. The confidential client advised that, although Parsons has strong performance on this program, they are considering whether to exercise the second option year to extend Parsons existing contract through Q1 2026 or to otherwise re-compete the contract. If the client does re-compete the contract, Parsons intends to submit a proposal for the continued performance of its work. If the contract is re-competed, and it is not awarded to Parsons, it could have a material adverse impact. 
 As described in the Form 10-K, the United States federal government is our largest customer and is projected to make up 60 of our total revenue for 2024. Two customer sets within the federal government are projected to exceed 20 of revenue given recent growth. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equit y Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 On August 9, 2021, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the Company to acquire a number of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate market value of not greater than 100 million from time to time, commencing on August 12, 2021. The Board amended this authorization in August 2022 to remove the prior expiration date and grant executive leadership the discretion to determine the price for such share repurchases. The Board further amended this authorization in February 2024 to restore the repurchase capacity to 100 million and removed the 25 million quarterly cap on such repurchases. 
 At the time of the February 2024 authorization, the Company had repurchased shares with an aggregated market value (including fees) of 54.7 million. The aggregate market value of shares of Common Stock the Company is authorized to acquire, from both the August 2021 and February 2024 authorizations, is not greater than 154.7 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 90 million remaining under the stock repurchase program. 
 Repurchased shares of common stock are retired and included in Repurchases of common stock in cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The primary purpose of the Company s share repurchase program is to reduce the dilutive effect of shares issued under the Company s ESOP and other stock benefit plans. The timing, amount and manner of share repurchases may depend upon market conditions and economic circumstances, availability of investment opportunities, the availability and costs of financing, the market price of the Company's common stock, other uses of capital and other factors. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has spent 64.7 million (which includes commissions paid of 31.2 thousand) repurchasing 1,557,529 shares of Common Stock (all of which have been retired) at an average price of 41.54 per share. 
 There were no share repurchases for the three months ended September 30, 2024.
