We operated stores for Walmart Inc. Walmart as of December 30, 2023; these stores are not reflected in the store counts above and the operating results of these stores are presented as discontinued operations. Also presented in discontinued operations are the majority of the operations formerly conducted by the Company s Arlington Contact Lens AC Lens subsidiary. Refer to Note 2. Discontinued Operations for more information. 
 As of September 28, 2024, the variable interest entities include professional corporations. The total assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, were million and million, respectively, and the total liabilities of the consolidated VIEs were million and million, respectively. 
 Seasonality 
 The consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year due to seasonality and uncertainty of general economic conditions that may impact our key markets. Historically, our business has realized a higher portion of net revenue, income from operations, and cash flows from operations in the first half of the year, and a lower portion of net revenue, income from operations, and cash flows from operations in the fourth fiscal quarter. The first half seasonality is attributable primarily to the timing of our customers personal income tax refunds and annual health insurance program start/reset periods. Seasonality related to fourth quarter holiday

 million and million were recorded for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 related to our Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset and tangible long-lived store assets and Right of Use ROU assets, compared to million and million related to tangible long-lived store assets and ROU assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The impairments were recognized in Corporate/Other, and are reflected in Asset impairment in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Refer to Note 5. Fair Value Measurement for additional information on impairment charges. 
 We tested the Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset for recoverability as of September 28, 2024 due to the decision to close certain Fred Meyer stores as part of our store fleet review in the current period. We determined that the carrying value of the asset was not recoverable and recognized an impairment of million related to this asset during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Aggregate intangible asset amortization expense is included in Depreciation and amortization in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter 
 
 Impairments of tangible long-lived store assets and ROU assets were primarily driven by lower than projected customer sales volume in certain stores and other entity-specific assumptions, and also reflect the effects of certain store closure decisions made as part of the Company s store optimization review in the current period. We considered multiple factors including, but not limited to: forecasted scenarios related to store performance and the likelihood that these scenarios would be ultimately realized; and the remaining useful lives of the assets. 
 Store fleet review 
 During the three months ended September 28, 2024, we completed a comprehensive store fleet review and decided on actions to address identified stores. As a result of this review, we plan to close 39 stores and convert four Eyeglass World stores to America s Best stores. During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, we recognized costs of million consisting primarily of lease termination costs and termination benefits for certain associates. Substantially all of the costs were recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
 
 Additional costs incurred related to the store fleet review during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 include million of non-cash intangible asset impairment and million of non-cash tangible long-lived and ROU asset impairment, both recognized in Asset impairment in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Refer to Note 5. Fair Value Measurement for additional information on the impairment charges. 
 All costs incurred related to the store fleet review were recognized in the Corporate/Other category. Liabilities related to this plan are recorded in Other payables and accrued expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

These charges were recorded in both Selling, general, and administrative expenses and Costs applicable to revenue for discontinued operations. The plan has been substantially completed and we do not anticipate additional material costs related to this plan. 
 As a result of the termination of the Walmart MSA and wind down of AC Lens operations, our former Legacy reportable segment and certain other results previously included in our Corporate/Other and Reconciliations categories, met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and results of operations of the discontinued operations have been presented in the tables below.

A decrease in the estimated cash flows would lead to a lower fair value measurement, as would an increase in the discount rate. These non-recurring fair value measurements are classified as Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. 
 Long-lived Store and ROU Store Assets 
 The cash flows used in estimating fair value were discounted using market rates of to . The estimated remaining fair value of the store assets impaired during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was million and million, respectively; the estimated remaining fair values include amounts estimated at various dates during the related fiscal years. Substantially all of the remaining fair value of the impaired store assets represents the fair value of ROU assets. 
 Finite-Lived Intangible Assets 
 Related to the impairment recognized for the Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset, we estimated fair value using the discounted cash flow method of the income approach. The cash flows included assumptions about future extensions of our relationship with Fred Meyer, as well as assumptions about future revenue growth and profitability, and were discounted using a rate of . The estimated remaining fair value of the asset was million as of September 28, 2024. Refer to Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation for more details on the Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset. 
 Additional fair value information 
 Term Loan A and Revolving Loans 
 Since the borrowings under the million outstanding principal first lien term loan Term Loan A and revolving credit loans in an aggregate principal amount of million (the Revolving Loans utilize variable interest rate setting mechanisms such as Term SOFR, the fair values of these borrowings are deemed to approximate the carrying values.

Overview 
 We are one of the largest optical retailers in the U.S. and a leader in the attractive value segment of the U.S. optical retail industry. We believe that vision is central to quality of life and that people deserve to see their best to live their best, regardless of their budget. We achieve this by providing eye exams, eyeglasses and contact lenses to value seeking and lower income consumers with an opening price point that strives to be among the lowest in the industry, enabled by our low-cost operating platform. We reach our customers through a diverse portfolio of 1,231 retail stores across four brands as well as multiple consumer websites as of September 28, 2024. 
 
 Brand and Segment Information 
 As of September 28, 2024, our operations consisted of one reportable segment. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, our Walmart store operations, including our former Legacy reportable segment and components of our Corporate/Other category met the requirements to be classified as discontinued operations; refer to Part I. Item 1. Note 2. Discontinued Operations for more information on discontinued operations. 
 Owned Host - As of September 28, 2024, our owned brands consisted of 1,019 America s Best Contacts and Eyeglasses retail stores and 130 Eyeglass World retail stores. Our Host brands consisted of 53 Vista Optical locations on select military bases and 29 Vista Optical locations within select Fred Meyer stores as of September 28, 2024. All brands utilize our centralized laboratories. This segment also includes sales from our America s Best, Eyeglass World, and Military omni-channel websites. 
 Our consolidated results also include the following activity recorded in our Corporate/Other category: 
 Our e-commerce website that was formerly part of AC Lens and was transitioned to NVI as part of the wind down of AC Lens operations. 
 The business conducted by FirstSight, our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed as a single-service health plan under California law. In connection with the termination of the Walmart MSA, the agreement between FirstSight and Walmart, which arranged for the provision by FirstSight of optometric services at optometric offices next to certain Walmart stores throughout California, terminated on February 23, 2024. 
 Unallocated corporate overhead expenses. 
 Reportable segment information is presented on the same basis as our condensed consolidated financial statements, except reportable segment sales which are presented on a cash basis, including point of sales for managed care payors and excluding the effects of unearned and deferred revenue, consistent with what our CODM regularly reviews. Reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results include financial information necessary to adjust reportable segment revenues to a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, specifically the change in unearned and deferred revenues during the period. There are no other items in the reconciliations other than the effects of unearned and deferred revenue. See Note 12. Segment Reporting in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I. Item 1. of this Form 10-Q. 
 Deferred revenue represents the timing difference of when we collect the cash from the customer and when services related to product protection plans and eye care club memberships are performed. Increases or decreases in deferred revenue during the reporting period represent cash collections in excess of, or below the recognition of, previous deferrals. Unearned revenue represents the timing difference of when we collect cash from the customer and

 delivery/customer acceptance, and includes sales of prescription eyewear during approximately the last seven to 10 days of the reporting period. 

Trends and Other Factors Affecting Our Business 
 As previously announced, we are taking new actions to accelerate our transformation, which include new additions to our executive leadership team, continued expansion of exam capacity, new traffic-driving initiatives, and initiatives to strengthen the foundation of the business for profitable growth. As part of this endeavor, we have completed a comprehensive review of our portfolio of stores to optimize our fleet for profitability and overall performance. Following the comprehensive review, we currently plan to close 39 stores and convert four Eyeglass World stores to America s Best stores by the end of 2026. In connection with this review, we have recorded certain impairment of intangible assets, property and equipment and ROU assets, as well as one-time non-recurring exit charges associated with the fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 closures. Refer to Part I. Item 1. Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation and Note 5. Fair Value Measurement for information on the impairment charges and costs incurred related to the store fleet review. 
 Current macroeconomic conditions, including elevated inflation and interest rates and overall consumer sentiment, have negatively impacted and may continue to have adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition, which could be material. Inflation has resulted in increased costs and greater profitability pressure. We have experienced wage rate pressure and increases in raw materials prices, which we expect to continue. Inflationary pressures, including elevated wages, consumer confidence and preferences and increased raw material costs could impact our profitability and lead us to attempt to offset such increases through various pricing actions. We have historically employed a simple low price/high value strategy and seek to balance our pricing and growth in a way that consistently delivers savings to our customers. From time to time, and increasingly in connection with our new transformation initiatives, we may take pricing actions and introduce limited-time promotions or new offers designed to increase traffic, awareness and sales. Several factors may impact the level of success of such actions and promotions, including consumer sentiment, macroeconomic conditions and marketing effectiveness, and as a result, if they do not meet our expectations, they could negatively impact our margins and profitability. 
 Additionally, our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified vision care professionals impacts exam capacity. We believe factors such as an increasingly challenging recruiting market (in particular for new graduates), preferences for adjusted work schedules, and the demand for optometrists exceeding supply in certain areas have caused constraints in vision care professional availability, and therefore exam capacity, which are continuing. As a result, recruiting and retaining optometrists has become more challenging and the costs to employ or retain optometrists have increased and may increase further, potentially materially. 
 We believe that customers in our target market are value-seeking consumers, many of whom are lower income consumers and may rely on tax refunds to pay for eyewear and eye care. Historically, our business has experienced seasonality in the first half of the year that we believe is primarily attributable to the timing of customers income tax refunds and health insurance start/reset periods. A delay in the issuance of tax refunds or changes in the amount of tax refunds can, accordingly. have a negative impact on our quarterly financial results in the first half of the year. Consumer behavior with respect to the utilization of tax refund proceeds is also subject to change. 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we incurred costs related to the termination of the Walmart MSA and the wind-down of AC Lens operations, as well as an immaterial amount of costs related to the actions taken in fiscal year 2023 to streamline corporate overhead. While we seek to reduce costs and replace lost business with new America s Best or Eyeglass World stores and by other means, including anticipated pricing actions, we may not be successful in our efforts, which could impact our revenues and profitability. 
 Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of the risk factors we face. 
 
 How We Assess the Performance of Our Business 
 We consider a variety of financial and operating measures in assessing the performance of our business. The key measures we use to determine how our consolidated business and operating segments are performing are net revenue, costs applicable to revenue, and selling, general, and administrative expenses. In addition, we also review store growth, Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Diluted EPS.

Table of Contents 

 Net Revenue 
 We report as net revenue amounts generated in transactions with retail customers who are the end users of our products, services and plans. Comparable store sales growth and new store openings are key drivers of net revenue and are discussed below. Also, the timing of unearned revenue can affect revenue recognized in a particular period. 
 Costs Applicable to Revenue 
 Customer tastes and preferences, product mix, changes in technology, significant increases or slowdowns in production, and other factors impact costs applicable to revenue. The components of our costs applicable to revenue may not be comparable to other retailers. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 SG A expenses generally fluctuate consistently with revenue due to the variable store, field office and corporate support costs; however, some fixed costs may decrease as a percentage of net revenue as our net revenues grow over time. 
 New Store Openings 
 The total number of new stores per year and the timing of store openings has had an impact, and we expect will continue to have an impact, on our results. We expect to open 65 to 70 stores in the current year. We plan to open 30-35 new stores in fiscal year 2025 to allow us to invest capital in existing operations to enhance the overall store experience. We are continuing to monitor and determine our plans for future new store openings at a level appropriate for incremental free cash flow generation and healthy growth, and based on health, safety and economic conditions. 
 Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth 
 We measure Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth as the increase or decrease in sales recorded by the comparable store base in any reporting period, compared to sales recorded by the comparable store base in the prior reporting period, which we calculate as follows: (i) sales are recorded on a cash basis (i.e., when the order is placed and paid for or submitted to a managed care payor, compared to when the order is delivered), utilizing cash basis point of sale information from stores; (ii) stores are added to the calculation during the 13th full fiscal month following the store s opening; (iii) closed stores are removed from the calculation for time periods that are not comparable; (iv) sales from partial months of operation are excluded when stores do not open or close on the first day of the month; and (v) when applicable, we adjust for the effect of the 53rd week. Quarterly, year-to-date and annual adjusted comparable store sales are aggregated using only sales from all whole months of operation included in both the current reporting period and the prior reporting period. When a partial month is excluded from the calculation, the corresponding month in the subsequent period is also excluded from the calculation. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable store sales. As a result, our adjusted comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers. 
 Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we believe is useful because it provides timely and accurate information relating to the two core metrics of retail sales: number of transactions and value of transactions. We use Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth as the basis for key operating decisions, such as allocation of advertising to particular markets and implementation of special marketing programs. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth provides timely and accurate information relating to the operational health and overall performance of each brand. We also believe that, for the same reasons, investors find our calculation of Adjusted Comparable Stores Sales Growth to be meaningful. 
 Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Diluted EPS (collectively, the Company Non-GAAP Measures 
 The Company Non-GAAP Measures are key measures used by management to assess our financial performance. The Company Non-GAAP Measures are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties. We use the Company Non-GAAP Measures to supplement U.S. GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to establish discretionary annual incentive compensation and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for definitions of the Company Non-GAAP Measures and for additional information.

 (1) We calculate total comparable store sales from continuing operations based on consolidated net revenue from continuing operations excluding the impact of (i) Corporate/Other segment net revenue, (ii) sales from stores opened less than 13 months, (iii) stores closed in the periods presented, (iv) sales from partial months of operation when stores do not open or close on the first day of the month and (v) if applicable, the impact of a 53rd week in a fiscal year. Brand-level comparable store sales growth is calculated based on cash basis revenues consistent with what the CODM reviews, and consistent with reportable segment revenues presented in Note 12. Segment Reporting in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I. Item 1. of this Form 10-Q. 
 (2) Percentages reflect line item as a percentage of net revenue, adjusted for rounding. 
 (3) Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth from continuing operations includes the effect of deferred and unearned revenue as if such revenues were earned at the point of sale, resulting in a decrease of 0.5 and an increase of 0.6 from total comparable store sales growth from continuing operations based on consolidated net revenue from continuing operations for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Total net revenue of 451.5 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 increased 12.7 million, or 2.9 , from 438.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Approximately 110 of the increase was driven by growth from new store sales, approximately 30 of the increase was driven by Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth from continuing operations and 10 from the timing of unearned revenue, partially offset by approximately 20 from effects of converted and closed stores and 20 from lower e-commerce revenue. 
 Comparable store sales growth from continuing operations and Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth from continuing operations for the three months ended September 28, 2024 were 1.4 and 0.9 , respectively, both reflecting a higher average ticket and an increase in customer transactions. 
 In the three months ended September 28, 2024, we opened 18 America s Best stores and closed two America s Best and one Military store as a result of the host partner s decision to cease its overall operations at the location. Overall, store count grew 4.9 from September 30, 2023 to September 28, 2024 (56 and three net new America s Best and Eyeglass World stores were added, respectively, and one Military store closed). We also converted 20 Eyeglass World stores to America s Best stores from September 30, 2023 to September 28, 2024. 
 Net product sales comprised 80.4 and 80.8 of total net revenue for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Net product sales increased 8.6 million, or 2.4 , in the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by a 8.4 million, or 3.0 increase in eyeglass sales.

Table of Contents 

 Net sales of services and plans for the three months ended September 28, 2024 increased 4.1 million, or 4.9 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by higher eye exam revenues of 3.9 million, or 7.3 . 
 Owned Host segment net revenue. Net revenue increased 14.2 million, or 3.3 , driven primarily by new store openings and comparable store sales growth, partially offset by converted and closed stores. 
 Net revenue reconciliations. The impact of reconciliations positively impacted net revenue by 1.5 million in the three months ended September 28, 2024. Net revenue was positively impacted by 1.7 million due to the timing of unearned revenue. Net revenue was negatively impacted by 0.2 million as a result of higher sales of club memberships, partially offset by higher recognition of product protection plan revenue in the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Costs applicable to revenue 
 Costs applicable to revenue of 189.9 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 increased 6.1 million, or 3.3 , from 183.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net revenue, costs applicable to revenue increased from 41.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 42.1 for the three months ended September 28, 2024. This increase as a percentage of net revenue was primarily driven by growth in optometrist-related costs of 60 basis points and 10 basis points from other mix and margin effects. These costs were partially offset by a 50 basis point effect from higher exam revenue. 
 Costs of products as a percentage of net product sales was 29.3 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and 29.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increased eyeglass mix and higher contact lens margin. 
 Owned Host segment costs of products. Costs of products as a percentage of net product sales decreased from 28.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 28.5 for the three months ended September 28, 2024, primarily driven by higher contact lens margin, partially offset by lower eyeglass mix. 
 Costs of services and plans as a percentage of net sales of services and plans increased from 92.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 94.5 for the three months ended September 28, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by growth in optometrist-related costs, partially offset by higher eye exam revenue. 
 Owned Host segment costs of services and plans. Costs of services and plans as a percentage of net sales of services and plans increased from 92.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 94.2 for the three months ended September 28, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by growth in optometrist-related costs, partially offset by higher eye exam revenue. 
 Selling, general and administrative 
 SG A of 234.0 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 increased 6.5 million, or 2.8 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net revenue, SG A was 51.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with 51.8 for the three months ended September 28, 2024. SG A as a percentage of net revenue was impacted by lower performance-based incentive compensation expense of 80 basis points, offset by higher payroll expense of 40 basis points and other operating expenses, including higher IT investments and occupancy expense. 
 Owned Host SG A. SG A as a percentage of net revenue increased from 39.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 40.3 for the three months ended September 28, 2024, primarily driven by an increase in payroll and other operating expenses. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense of 22.7 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 increased 0.2 million, or 1.0 , from 22.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by investments in remote medicine technology and new store openings, partially offset by lower depreciation of labs and distribution center. 
 Asset Impairment 
 We recognized 13.7 million primarily for impairment related to the Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset and tangible long-lived assets and ROU assets associated with our retail stores during the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 1.5 million impairment recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023 for tangible long-lived assets and ROU assets associated with our retail stores. Refer to Part I. Item 1. Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation for more details on the Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset. The store asset impairment charge is related to our Owned Host segment driven by lower than projected customer sales volume, and other entity-specific assumptions, and also reflects the effects of

 certain store closure decisions made as part of the Company s store optimization review in the current period. We considered multiple factors including, but not limited to: forecasted scenarios related to store performance and the likelihood that these scenarios would be ultimately realized; and the remaining useful lives of the assets. Asset impairment expenses were recognized in Corporate/Other. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net, was 4.1 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily a result of lower interest income on cash balances of 1.0 million, partially offset by lower interest expense on our debt of 0.8 million. 
 Income tax provision (benefit) 
 Our effective tax rates for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 30.1 and (109.1) , respectively. The change in effective tax rates reflects our statutory federal and state rates of 25.2 and 25.4 , respectively, tax impacts of consolidated VIEs, as well as effects of other permanent items. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax of (0.0) million for the three months ended September 28, 2024, increased 73.4 million from (73.4) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net revenue, costs applicable to revenue, SG A, and asset impairment from discontinued operations decreased by 93.6 million, 68.2 million, 22.4 million and 79.2 million, respectively, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the prior year including the discontinued operations results and impairments of intangible assets and property and equipment related to our former Legacy and AC Lens segments prior to the Walmart MSA termination date and the wind-down of AC Lens operations. Income tax expense (benefit) decreased by 4.7 million, due to lower income (loss) before income taxes in the current period as compared to the prior year and the disallowance of the Legacy segment goodwill impairment loss for income tax purposes in the prior year period as well as other permanent items related to discontinued operations.

 (1) We calculate total comparable store sales from continuing operations based on consolidated net revenue from continuing operations excluding the impact of (i) Corporate/Other segment net revenue, (ii) sales from stores opened less than 13 months, (iii) stores closed in the periods presented, (iv) sales from partial months of operation when stores do not open or close on the first day of the month and (v) if applicable, the impact of a 53rd week in a fiscal year. Brand-level comparable store sales growth is calculated based on cash basis revenues consistent with what the CODM reviews, and consistent with reportable segment revenues presented in Note 12. Segment Reporting in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I. Item 1. of this Form 10-Q. 
 (2) Percentages reflect line item as a percentage of net revenue, adjusted for rounding. 
 (3) Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth from continuing operations includes the effect of deferred and unearned revenue as if such revenues were earned at the point of sale, resulting in a decrease of 0.5 and a decrease of 0.1 from total comparable store sales growth from continuing operations based on consolidated net revenue from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Total net revenue of 1,386.0 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased 50.6 million, or 3.8 , from 1,335.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Approximately 90 of the increase was driven by growth from new store sales, approximately 30 was driven by Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth from continuing operations, and approximately 10 from the timing of unearned revenue, partially offset by approximately 20 by effects of converted and closed stores and 10 from lower e-commerce revenue. 
 Comparable store sales growth from continuing operations and Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 were 1.7 and 1.2 , respectively, both reflecting a higher average ticket and an increase in customer transactions. 
 In the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we opened 46 new America s Best stores and three Eyeglass World stores, closed four America s Best stores, one Eyeglass World store, and one Military store as a result of the host partner s decision to cease its overall operations at the location and converted 20 Eyeglass World stores to America s Best stores. Overall, store count grew 4.9 from September 30, 2023 to September 28, 2024 (56 and three net new America s Best and Eyeglass World stores, respectively, and one Military store closed). We also converted 20 Eyeglass World stores to America s Best stores from September 30, 2023 to September 28, 2024. 
 Net product sales comprised 80.3 and 81.4 of total net revenue for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Net product sales increased 26.3 million, or 2.4 , in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 18.6 million, or 2.2 , increase in eyeglass sales and a 5.5 million, or 2.4 , increase in contact lens sales. 
 Net sales of services and plans for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased 24.3 million, or 9.8 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by higher exam revenues of 23.1 million, or 15.0 . 
 Owned Host segment net revenue. Net revenue increased 49.8 million, or 3.8 , driven primarily by new store openings and comparable store sales growth, partially offset by converted and closed stores. 
 Net revenue reconciliations. The impact of reconciliations positively impacted net revenue by 4.6 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net revenue was positively impacted by 4.5 million due to the timing of unearned revenue. Net revenue was positively impacted by 0.1 million primarily due to higher recognition of product protection plan revenue, partially offset by higher sales of club memberships in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Costs applicable to revenue 
 Costs applicable to revenue of 579.1 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased 28.8 million, or 5.2 , from 550.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net revenue, costs applicable to revenue increased from 41.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 41.8 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024. This increase as a percentage of net revenue was primarily driven by growth in optometrist-related costs of 80 basis points, lower eyeglass mix of 80 basis points, and other mix and margin effects of 20 basis points. These costs were partially offset by a 120 basis point effect from higher exam revenue. 
 Costs of products as a percentage of net product sales was 29.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 28, 2024 primarily driven by lower eyeglass mix, offset by other mix and margin effects. 
 Owned Host segment costs of products. Costs of products as a percentage of net product sales increased from 28.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 28.8 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, primarily driven by lower eyeglass mix, partially offset by other mix and margin effects.

 Costs of services and plans as a percentage of net sales of services and plans decreased from 91.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 91.0 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by higher exam revenue, partially offset by growth in optometrist-related costs. 
 Owned Host segment costs of services and plans. Costs of services and plans as a percentage of net sales of services and plans decreased from 90.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 90.2 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by higher exam revenue, partially offset by growth in optometrist-related costs. 
 Selling, general and administrative 
 SG A of 705.5 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased 26.4 million, or 3.9 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net revenue, SG A was 50.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 28, 2024. SG A as a percentage of net revenue was impacted by increases in litigation settlement of 30 basis points, occupancy of 30 basis points and legal and professional expenses of 30 basis points, and were offset by decreases in performance-based incentive compensation of 90 basis points. 
 Owned Host SG A. SG A as a percentage of net revenue increased from 38.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 39.1 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, driven primarily by higher payroll and occupancy expense. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense of 68.6 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased 2.1 million, or 3.1 , from 66.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by new store openings and investments in remote medicine technology, partially offset by lower depreciation of labs and distribution center. 
 Asset impairment 
 We recognized 17.7 million primarily for impairment related to the Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset and tangible long-lived assets and ROU assets associated with our retail stores during the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 2.7 million impairment recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for tangible long-lived assets and ROU assets associated with our retail stores. Refer to Part I. Item 1. Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation for more details on the Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset. The store asset impairment charge is related to our Owned Host segment and is driven by lower than projected customer sales volume in certain stores, and other entity-specific assumptions and also reflects the effects of certain store closure decisions made as part of the Company s store optimization review in the current period. We considered multiple factors including, but not limited to: forecasted scenarios related to store performance and the likelihood that these scenarios would be ultimately realized; and the remaining useful lives of the assets. Asset impairment expenses were recognized in Corporate/Other. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net was 11.6 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily a result of lower derivative income of 2.0 million and lower income on cash balances of 1.7 million, partially offset by lower interest expense on our debt of 2.1 million. 
 Income tax provision (benefit) 
 Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 49.6 and 31.0 , respectively. The change in effective tax rates reflects our statutory federal and state rates of 25.2 and 25.4 , respectively, tax impacts of consolidated VIEs and non-deductible compensation expense as well as effects of other permanent items.

 Discontinued Operations 
 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, of (2.2) million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, increased 66.0 million from (68.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net revenue, costs applicable to revenue, SG A, and asset impairment from discontinued operations decreased by 153.2 million, 91.4 million and 41.5 million, and 79.2 million, respectively, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the current year including the discontinued operations results only for a partial period prior to the Walmart MSA termination date and the wind-down of AC Lens operations and impairments of intangible assets and property and equipment related to our former Legacy and AC Lens segments recorded in the third quarter of 2023. Income tax expense (benefit) decreased by 0.8 million, due to lower income (loss) before income taxes in the current period as compared to the prior year and the disallowance of the Legacy segment goodwill impairment loss for income tax purposes in the prior year period as well as other permanent items related to discontinued operation. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Diluted EPS. 
 We define Adjusted Operating Income as net income (loss), plus interest expense (income), net and income tax provision (benefit), further adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairment, litigation settlement, secondary offering expenses, management realignment expenses, long-term incentive plan expenses, ERP and CRM implementation expenses and certain other expenses. We define Adjusted Operating Margin as Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of net revenue. We define EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense (income), net, income tax provision (benefit) and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense (income), net, income tax provision (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairment, litigation settlement, secondary offering expenses, management realignment expenses, long-term incentive plan expenses, ERP and CRM implementation expenses and certain other expenses. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue. We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as diluted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted for the per share impact of stock-based compensation expense, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairment, litigation settlement, secondary offering expenses, management realignment expenses, long-term incentive plan expenses, amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs of our term loan borrowings, amortization of the conversion feature and deferred financing costs related to our 2025 Notes when not required under U.S. GAAP to be added back for diluted earnings (loss) per share, derivative fair value adjustments, ERP and CRM implementation expenses, certain other expenses, less the tax effect of these adjustments, including tax expense (benefit) from stock-based compensation. 
 When presenting Adjusted Operating Income from continuing operations, EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations we use the same definitions for Adjusted Operating Income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, and also exclude income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. When presenting Adjusted Diluted EPS from continuing operations, we use the same definition for Adjusted Diluted EPS, and also exclude diluted earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations. When presenting Adjusted Operating Margin from continuing operations, we use Adjusted Operating Income from continuing operations as a percentage of total net revenue. When presenting Adjusted EBITDA Margin from continuing operations, we use Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as a percentage of total net revenue. 
 EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures can vary substantially in size from one period to the next, and certain types of expenses are non-recurring in nature and consequently may not have been incurred in any of the periods presented below. 
 EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures have been presented as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management believes EBITDA, and the Company Non-GAAP Measures are useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. We also use EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures to supplement U.S. GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to establish discretionary annual incentive compensation and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management supplements U.S. GAAP results with Non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than U.S. GAAP results alone. We continue to

Table of Contents 

 evaluate our use of the Company Non-GAAP measures in the context of the development of our business, and may introduce or discontinue certain measures in the future as we deem appropriate. 
 EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or income from operations as a measure of financial performance or cash flows provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, these measures are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management s discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. In evaluating EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures, we may incur expenses in the future that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on our U.S. GAAP results in addition to using EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures. 
 The presentations of these measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 they do not reflect costs or cash outlays for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income do not reflect the interest expense (income), net, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income do not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax provision or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; 
 they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and 
 other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 Because of these limitations, EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or to reduce indebtedness.

 (a) Non-cash charges related to stock-based compensation programs, which vary from period to period depending on the timing of awards and performance vesting conditions. 
 (b) For the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, reflects the gain on extinguishment related to the repurchase of 217.7 million of the 2025 Notes on August 12, 2024. 
 (c) Reflects write-off related to non-cash impairment charges of long-lived assets, primarily impairment of Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset of 10.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, and impairment of property, equipment and lease-related assets on closed or underperforming stores and certain store closure decisions made as part of the Company s store optimization review in the current period. 
 (d) Expenses associated with settlement of certain litigation. 
 (e) Amortization of deferred financing costs and other non-cash charges related to our debt. We adjust for amortization of deferred financing costs related to the 2025 Notes only when adjustment for these costs is not required in the calculation of diluted earnings per share under U.S. GAAP. 
 (f) The adjustments for the derivative fair value (gains) and losses have the effect of adjusting the (gain) or loss for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and amortization of AOCL for derivatives not designated as accounting hedges. This results in reflecting derivative (gains) and losses within Adjusted Diluted EPS during the period the derivative is settled. 
 (g) Costs related to the Company s ERP and CRM implementation. 
 (h) Other adjustments include amounts that management believes are not representative of our operating performance (amounts in brackets represent reductions in Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA), which are primarily related to costs associated with the digitization of paper-based records of 1.5 million and 5.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, costs associated with the store fleet review of 1.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, and other expenses and adjustments. Other adjustments for both Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS include amortization of the increase in carrying values of finite-lived intangible assets resulting from the application of purchase accounting following the acquisition of the Company by affiliates of KKR Co. Inc. Adjusted Diluted EPS is also adjusted to include debt issuance costs. 
 (i) Represents the income tax effect of the total adjustments at our combined statutory federal and state income tax rates, including tax expense (benefit) from stock-based compensation. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary cash needs are for inventory, payroll, store rent, advertising, capital expenditures associated with new stores and updating existing stores, as well as information and remote medicine technology and infrastructure, including our corporate office, distribution centers, and laboratories. When appropriate, the Company may utilize excess liquidity towards debt service requirements, including voluntary debt prepayments, or required interest and principal payments, if any, as well as repurchases of common stock or other securities, based on excess cash flows. The most significant components of our operating assets and liabilities are inventories, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable, deferred and unearned revenue and other payables and accrued expenses. We exercise prudence in our use of cash and closely monitor various items related to cash flow including, but not limited to, cash receipts, cash disbursements, payment terms and alternative sources of funding. We continue to be focused on these items in addition to other key measures we use to determine how our consolidated business and operating segments are performing. We believe that cash on hand, cash expected to be generated from operations and the availability of borrowings under our Revolving Loans will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, liquidity obligations, anticipated capital expenditures, and payments due under our existing debt for the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Depending on our liquidity levels, conditions in the capital markets and other factors, we may from time to time consider the prepayment, refinancing or issuance of debt, issuance of equity or other securities, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations, as well as modifications to our Term Loan A where possible. 
 We recently established an incremental term loan in the amount of 115.0 million and used the proceeds of this borrowing in addition to cash on hand to repurchase 217.7 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes. Refer to Part I. Item 1. Note 6. Debt for more information. Depending on market conditions and other factors, we may elect to repurchase all or a significant portion of our 2025 Notes outstanding principal balance of 84.8 million prior to their maturity on May 15, 2025, utilizing cash on hand and/or one or more of the additional liquidity sources noted above. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control. We primarily fund our working capital needs using cash provided by operations. Our working capital requirements for inventory will increase as we continue to open additional stores. 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had 81.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and 293.6 million of availability under our Revolving Loans, which includes 6.4 million in outstanding letters of credit. 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had 257.5 million of Term Loan A outstanding under our credit agreement. We were in compliance with all covenants related to our debt as of September 28, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 The following table summarizes cash flows provided by (used for) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended In thousands September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Cash flows provided by (used for): Operating activities 103,367 153,272 Investing activities (62,368) (82,579) Financing activities (109,351) (34,165) Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (68,352) 36,528 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by 49.9 million to 103.4 million, during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 from 153.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of a decrease in non-cash reconciling items of 77.2 million and changes in net working capital and other assets and liabilities of 22.8 million, partially offset by an increase in net income of 50.0 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Both the increase in net income and decrease in non-cash adjustments were primarily driven by the termination of the Walmart partnership and related impairment charges of 79.4 million in the prior year period, partially offset by impairments of long-lived assets and intangible assets of 17.9 million in the current year period. 
 Decreases in other liabilities during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 used 52.2 million in year-over-year cash, primarily due to decreases in compensation-related accruals. Decreases in accounts payable used 25.6 million in year-over-year cash. These were partially offset by decreases in trade receivables, which contributed 37.0 million in year-over-year cash and decreases in inventories which contributed 29.0 million in year-over-year cash during the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These changes in working capital during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 are primarily a result of the AC Lens wind down and the Walmart partnership termination. 
 Net Cash Used for Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities decreased by 20.2 million, to 62.4 million, during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 from 82.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower investments in doctor and in-store lab equipment, new stores, and labs and distribution center. 
 Net Cash Used For Financing Activities 
 Net cash used for financing activities was 109.4 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to 34.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 75.2 million year-over-year increase in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to an increase in principal payments of debt due to the repurchase of the 217.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes for an aggregate cash repurchase price of 215.0 million . This increase was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from long-term debt related to the additional borrowings of 115.0 million and a decrease in purchases of treasury stock of 24.8 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Share Repurchases 
 Effective February 23, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 50 million aggregate amount of shares of the Company s common stock until January 3, 2026. As of September 28, 2024, 50 million remains available under the share repurchase authorization. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock for 25.0 million. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our material cash requirements and commercial commitments from those reported in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 We follow U.S. GAAP in making the determination as to whether to record an asset or liability related to our arrangements with third parties. Consistent with current accounting guidance, we do not record an asset or liability associated with long-term purchase, marketing and promotional commitments, or commitments to philanthropic

 endeavors. We have disclosed the amount of future commitments associated with these items in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are not a party to any other material off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. Certain of these accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on historical experience, trends in the industry, information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates may be found in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as compared to the critical accounting policies described in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to Note 5. Fair Value Measurement for information on estimates related to the valuation of our Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset. 
 Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements 
 There have been no material changes due to recently issued or adopted accounting standards since those disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We have market risk exposure from changes in interest rates. When appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk from such exposure. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note 5. Fair Value Measurement and Note 7. Interest Rate Derivatives to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I. Item 1. of this Form 10-Q. 
 A portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, the interest rate on our variable rate debt will increase and will create higher debt service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow and could adversely impact our results of operations. 
 As of September 28, 2024, 257.5 million of term loan borrowings were subject to variable interest rates, and we had total borrowings of 342.3 million with a weighted average borrowing rate of 6.9 . Our interest rate collar matured on July 18, 2024 and our variable interest rate term loan borrowings are exposed to changes in market rates. A 1.0 increase in market rates would result in a 2.6 million increase in annual interest expense. For more information about quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, please see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Part II. of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that the Company s current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information relating to the Company required to be disclosed in the Company s periodic filings with the SEC is made known to them in a timely manner.
