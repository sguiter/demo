 units (the Units ), which includes the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of Units (Note 6), at per Unit, generating gross proceeds of , which is discussed in Note 3. Each Unit consists of Class A ordinary share and one -half of one redeemable warrant (the Public Warrant ). Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant, in a private placement to Melar Acquisition Sponsor I LLC, the Company s sponsor (the Sponsor ), and Cohen Company Capital Markets, a division of J.V.B. Financial Group, LLC and Seaport Global Securities LLC, the representatives of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering, generating gross proceeds of , which is described in Note 4. Transaction costs amounted to , consisting of of cash underwriting fee, of deferred underwriting fee (see additional discussion in Note 6), and of other offering costs. The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be generally applied toward consummating a Business Combination (less deferred underwriting commissions). The Company s Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least of the net balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing of an agreement to enter into a Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.

 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in the trust account (the Trust Account ), located in the United States, with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee, and held in cash, including in demand deposit accounts at a bank, or invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations; the holding of these assets in this form is intended to be temporary and for the sole purpose of facilitating the intended Business Combination. To mitigate the risk that the Company might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, which risk increases the longer that it holds investments in the Trust Account, the Company may, at any time (based on the management team s ongoing assessment of all factors related to the potential status under the Investment Company Act), instruct the trustee to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in cash or in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at a bank. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company for taxes payable, the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of the Company s public shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (i.e., June 20, 2026) or by such earlier liquidation date as the board of directors may approve (the Completion Window ), subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of the Company s public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the initial Business Combination or to redeem of the Company s public shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination within the Completion Window or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company s public shareholders. The Company will provide its public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem, regardless of whether they abstain, vote for, or against, the Company s initial Business Combination, all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the initial Business Combination or (ii) without a shareholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a proposed initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations. The amount in the Trust Account was initially per public share. The ordinary shares subject to redemption were recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In such case, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. The Company will have only the duration of the Completion Window to complete the initial Business Combination. However, if the Company is unable to complete its initial Business Combination within the Completion Window, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter (and subject to lawfully available funds therefor), redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

 of the public shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination within the Completion Window or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity; (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their founder shares if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Completion Window, although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Completion Window and to liquidating distributions from assets outside the Trust Account; and (iv) vote any founder shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of the initial Business Combination. The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and the Company believes that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Liquidity and Going Concern As of September 30, 2024, the Company had in its operating bank account and working capital of . The Company has until June 20, 2026, to consummate the initial Business Combination (assuming no extensions). If the Company does not complete a Business Combination, the Company will trigger an automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. In connection with the Company's assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2014 - 15, "Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern," management believes that the funds which the Company has available following the completion of the Initial Public Offering will enable it to sustain operations for a period of at least one - year from the issuance date of these financial statements.

 warrants outstanding, including Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase Class A ordinary share at a price of per share, subject to adjustment as discussed herein. The warrants cannot be exercised until after the completion of the initial Business Combination, and will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, after the completion of the initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current. No warrant will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue a Class A ordinary share upon exercise of a warrant unless the Class A ordinary share issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a Unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the Unit solely for the Class A ordinary share underlying such Unit. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, the Company has agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days, after the closing of its Business Combination, it will use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a post-effective amendment to the registration statement for the Initial Public Offering or a new registration statement covering the registration under the Securities Act of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and thereafter will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective within business days following the Company s initial Business Combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the sixtieth 60 th) business day after the closing of the initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. If the holders exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis, they would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the fair market value of the Class A ordinary shares over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value is the average reported closing price of the Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, as applicable. Redemption of Warrants When the Price per Class A Ordinary Share Equals or Exceeds : The Company may redeem the outstanding warrants: in whole and not in part; at a price of per warrant; upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption (the 30-day redemption period and if, and only if, the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) for any 20 trading days within a 30 - trading day period commencing at least after completion of the initial Business Combination and ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.

The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of September 30, 2024, Working Capital Loans were outstanding.

 demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company registers such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of the initial Business Combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement The underwriters had a -day option from the date of the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to an additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On June 20, 2024, simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option to purchase an additional Units.

The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely on amounts remaining in the Trust Account following all properly submitted shareholder redemption in connection with the consummation of the initial Business Combination.

Class A Ordinary Shares The Company is authorized to issue a total of Class A ordinary shares at par value of each. At September 30, 2024, there were Class A ordinary shares issued or outstanding, excluding Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption.

The founder shares included an aggregate of up to shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment option was not exercised in full, so that the number of founder shares will represent of the Company s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. At the time of the Initial Public Offering, the underwriters partially exercised the over - allotment option and in August 2024 the underwriters' allowed the remainder of the over - allotment option to expire resulting in founder shares being forfeited by the Sponsor. As of September 30, 2024, there were Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding.

Holders of record of the Company s Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares are entitled to vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. Unless specified in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or as required by the Companies Act (Revised) of the Cayman Islands as the same may be amended from time to time or stock exchange rules, an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law and the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, which requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by such shareholders as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or, where proxies are allowed, by proxy at the applicable general meeting of the Company is generally required to approve any matter voted on by the shareholders. Approval of certain actions requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, which (except as specified below) requires the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes cast by such shareholders as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or, where proxies are allowed, by proxy at the applicable general meeting of the Company, and pursuant to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, such actions include amending the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and approving a statutory merger or consolidation with another company.

References to our management or our management team refer to our officers and directors, and references to the Sponsor refer to Melar Acquisition Sponsor I LLC. The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report including, without limitation, statements in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the completion of the Business Combination (as defined below), the Company s financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as expect, believe, anticipate, intend, estimate, seek and variations and similar words and expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance, but reflect management s current beliefs, based on information currently available. A number of factors could cause actual events, performance or results to differ materially from the events, performance and results discussed in the forward-looking statements, including that the conditions of the Business Combination are not satisfied. For information identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Risk Factors section of the Company s final prospectus (the IPO Prospectus for its initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). The Company s securities filings can be accessed on the EDGAR section of the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 11, 2024 formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination ). We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants (as defined below), our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful. The SEC has adopted new rules and regulations relating to special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs"), which became effective on July 1, 2024 (the "2024 SPAC Rules"). The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among other matters, (i) additional disclosures relating to SPAC sponsors and related persons; (ii) additional disclosures relating to SPAC business combination transactions; (iii) additional disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest involving sponsors and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings and business combination transactions; (iv) additional disclosures regarding projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions; and (v) the requirement that both the SPAC and its target company be co - registrants for business combination registration statements. In addition, the SEC's adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a SPAC could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto.

 Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from March 11, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, as described below, and identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and marketable securities held in the trust account (the Trust Account ), located in the United States, with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 2,375,937, which consists of interest income on cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 2,363,818, interest on cash of 743 and an unrealized gain on over-allotment liability of 141,754, offset by operating costs of 130,378. For the period from March 11, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, we had net income of 2,463,105, which consists of interest income on cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 2,531,350, interest on cash of 743 and an unrealized gain on over-allotment liability of 169,119, offset by operating costs of 238,107. Factors That May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations Our results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, public health considerations, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. We cannot at this time predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination. Liquidity and Capital Resources On June 20, 2024, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 16,000,000 units (the Units ), which includes the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 1,000,000 Units (Note 6), at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 160,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 5,000,000 private placement warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, in a private placement to the Sponsor generating gross proceeds of 5,000,000. Following the Initial Public Offering, the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the Units and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, a total of 160,000,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred 10,184,856 in Initial Public Offering related costs, consisting of 3,000,000 of cash underwriting fee, 6,600,000 of deferred underwriting fee and 584,856 of other offering costs. For the period from March 11, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 489,390. Net income of 2,463,105 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 2,531,350, formation costs paid by the Sponsor in exchange for issuance of Class B ordinary shares of 6,236, payment of operation costs through promissory note of 10,420, and unrealized gain on over-allotment liability of 169,119. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used 268,682 of cash for operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 162,531,350 consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 185 days or less. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.

Table of Contents 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 934,098. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant, at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an aggregate of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities, and secretarial and administrative support services. The underwriters had a 45-day option from the date of the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to an additional 2,250,000 Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On June 20, 2024, simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,000,000 Units. The underwriters had 45 days from the date of the IPO Prospectus to purchase the remaining 1,250,000 Units. On August 4, 2024, the underwriters remaining over-allotment option expired worthless. The underwriters were entitled to an underwriting discount of 0.20 per unit, or 3,000,000 in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, the underwriters were entitled to a deferred fee of 0.40 per Unit on Units other than those sold pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional Units, and 0.60 per Unit on Units sold pursuant to the underwriters over-allotment option or 6,600,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely on amounts remaining in the Trust Account following all properly submitted shareholder redemption in connection with the consummation of the initial Business Combination. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The Company has not identified any critical accounting estimates but has identified the following critical accounting policies:

Table of Contents 
 Warrant Instruments The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in FASB ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s own ordinary shares and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Accordingly, the Company evaluated and classified the warrant instruments under equity treatment at its assigned fair value. Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our ordinary shares subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity (deficit). Our ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of our balance sheets. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of the redeemable ordinary shares are affected by charges against additional paid-in capital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Use of Proceeds For a description of the use of the proceeds generated in our Initial Public Offering, see Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None.
