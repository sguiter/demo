Impact of the Iron Swords War on Israel 

On
October 7, 2023, following the brutal attacks on Israel by Hamas, a terrorist organization located in the Gaza Strip that infiltrated
Israel s southern border and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets, Israel s security cabinet declared
war (the War ). Following the commencement of the War, hostilities also intensified between Israel and Hezbollah, a terrorist
organization located in Lebanon. This may escalate in the future into a greater regional conflict. The War led to a reduction of business
activities in Israel, evacuation of residences located in the northern and southern borders of Israel, a significant call up of military
reserves and lower availability of work force. 

As
the Group s customers are mainly in the US and Europe, its operations, revenues, and profitability were indirectly affected due
to recruitment of senior employees to military reserves for an extended period of time. 

In January 2024, Gix Media and Cortex filed
a request with the Israeli Tax Authority (the ITA to receive compensation for the decrease in revenues related to the
War. In April and May 2024, Gix Media and Cortex received a total of from the ITA that were recorded as other income in the Company s
consolidated statement of operations for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024. 

As
of the date of these financial statements the war is still on going. Therefore, there is no assurance that future developments of the
War will not have any impact for reasons beyond the Company s control, such as expansion of the War to additional regions. The Company has business continuity procedures in place, and will continue to follow developments,
assessing potential impact, if any, on the Company s business, financials, and operations. 

E.
Cortex Adverse Effect 

In
April 2024, the Company was informed by Cortex that a significant customer of Cortex recently notified Cortex it will stop advertising
on Cortex s sites, as part of its policy decision to cease advertising on Made for Advertising MFA sites (the Cortex
Adverse Effect ). The Cortex Adverse Effect, which has materially affected Cortex s business and operations, has occurred
following certain recent developments relating to publishers that are categorized by a number of on-line advertisers as MFA, including
decisions made by leading media on-line advertisers to prioritize different media categories and implement publishing restrictions in
connection with MFA. Due to the Cortex Adverse Effect and additional circumstances as explained in note 5.B, the Company recorded an
impairment of in the goodwill related to the digital content segment as of June 30, 2024.

F.
Going Concern 

During
the second half of 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company experienced a decrease in its revenues from the digital
content and search segments, as a result of the Cortex Adverse effect (see note 1.E), a decrease in user traffic acquired from third
party advertising platforms, an industry-wide decrease in advertising budget, changes and updates to internet browsers technology,
which adversely impacted the Company s ability to acquire traffic in the search segment and a decrease in revenues from routing
of traffic acquired from third-party strategic partners in the search segment, as a result of lack of availability of suppliers credit
from such third party strategic partners. As a result of the foregoing, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company
recorded an operating loss of compared to in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the Company recorded
a net loss of during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of , bank loans of and accumulated deficit of . 

The
decline in revenues and other circumstances described above raise substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue as

Overview
and Background 

Viewbix
Inc. (the Registrant , Viewbix or the Company is a digital advertising platform that develops
and markets a variety of technological platforms that automate, optimize and monetize digital online campaigns. Viewbix s operations
were previously focused on analysis of the video marketing performance of its clients as well as the effectiveness of their messaging Video Advertising Platform ). With the Video Advertising Platform, Viewbix allowed its clients with digital video properties
the ability to use its platforms in a way that allows viewers to engage and interact with the video. The Video Advertising Platform measures
when a viewer performs a specific action while watching a video and collects and reports the results to the client. However, due to the
Company s failure to meet predetermined sales targets which were set pursuant to the Recapitalization Transaction (as defined in
note 1.A to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements). with Gix Internet Ltd., in January 2020, the Company determined
to reduce its operations and the size of its sales and R D team in Video Advertising Platform. 

The
Company, through its subsidiaries Gix Media Ltd. Gix Media and Cortex Media Group Ltd. Cortex ), expanded
its digital advertising operations across two main sectors: ad search and digital content (the Search Platform and the
 Content Platform , respectively ). Gix Media and Cortex develop and market a variety of technological software solutions
that automate, optimize and monetize online campaigns. Cortex also creates, edits and markets content in various languages to different
target audiences in order to generate revenues from advertisements displayed together with the content, which are posted on digital content,
marketing and advertising platforms. These technological tools enable advertisers and website owners to earn more from their advertising
campaigns and generate additional profits from their sites. 

Through
its Search Platform, the Company provides services to leading search engines worldwide Search Engines by developing,
marketing and distributing software products to internet users. The operations and activity on this platform are powered by Gix Media. 

Through
the Content Platform, the Company provides editing and marketing services of content in different languages and to different target audiences
with the goal of generating revenues from advertising employed in such content, which is based on digital content marketing and advertising
platforms. The operations and activity on this platform are powered by Cortex. 

Search
Platform 

Gix
Media s Search Platform allows for the referral of user traffic (i.e., searches that are performed by internet users) to the Search
Engines, such as Yahoo and Bing, where the Search Engines display the ads of their customers. The Search Engines pay Gix Media for the
searches that were referred by it, based on the amount of consideration that the Search Engine receives from the advertisers for the
user traffic generated, less a certain percentage from the revenues attributed to the Search Engine. Since the customers of Gix Media
are the Search Engines, and not the advertisers, Gix Media recognizes revenues for the actual amount received from the Search Engines,
and not from the advertisement revenue itself. 

The
referral of user traffic by Gix Media to the Search Engines is possible after users download Gix Media s products, which are browser
add-ons, usually from the browser stores (mostly Google Chrome browsers) and by downloading desktop software products, free of charge,
for the Apple operating system (for Mac computers) and for the Microsoft operating system (for PC computers). When downloading Gix Media s
products, the users grant permission to Gix Media to refer the searches performed while using Gix Media s products to the Search
Engines. 

In
addition, Gix Media provides user traffic referral services to Search Engines through the referral of traffic of browsers who engage
content generated by Gix Media. This content is displayed on ad spaces that are purchased by the Company by content recommendation companies
(such as Yahoo!, Outbrain, Taboola and Gemini). When occasional users click on such content, Gix Media transfers user traffic to a Search
Engine which contains search words that are related to the advertising content.

Content
Platform 

Cortex s
Content Platform produces engaging content and marketing material in various languages to various target audiences, in order to generate
revenues from advertisements displayed together with the content, which are posted on digital content, marketing and advertising platforms.
Cortex acts as a digital content platform that publishes content written by creative writers and editors which it employs. The content
is displayed on several different content websites owned by Cortex, covering various subjects including culture, history, trips, pets,
entertainment and leisure, food, etc. (the Cortex Websites ). Cortex developed capabilities that enable it and its customers
to profit from the original content which it publishes by advertising the content on leading international third-party websites and online
ad platforms (the Third Party Platforms ). Readers are exposed to the articles on the Third-Party Platforms and may choose
to read them by clicking an ad, after which readers are directed automatically to the Cortex Websites where the content is posted. 

The
technological tools developed by Cortex allow businesses in the digital advertising market (Search Engines, ad exchanges, advertisers,
content owners and brand owners) to earn more from their advertising campaigns and generate additional profit from their websites, both
from its content and from its advertising. 

Advertisers
display ads on various platforms for potential customers (internet users and readers). In order to help maximize the effectiveness of
advertising, Cortex developed different advertising systems and tools for content management, content distribution and campaigns and
measurement of performance on the various platforms that display the content.

12 months from the closing date. The Cortex Acquisition also includes the obligation and right of Gix Media to acquire 30 of Cortex s

diluted basis. On January 23, 2023, Gix Media purchased an additional 10 of Cortex s share capital. In January 2024, Gix Media
did not purchase an additional 10 of Cortex s share capital, as Cortex did not meet certain Key Performance Indicators (KPIs),
as conditioned in the definitive agreements of the Cortex Acquisition. 

In
connection with the acquisition of Cortex on October 13, 2021 (the Cortex Acquisition ), Gix Media entered into a financing
agreement with Bank Leumi Le Israel Leumi ), for the provision of a line of credit in the total amount of up to 3.5 million

with a loan of up to 1,500,000 to be withdrawn at the discretion of Gix Media by no later than January 31, 2023 (the Additional
Loan ). The Additional Loan was withdrawn in connection with the purchase of the additional 10 of Cortex s share capital
on January 17, 2023. On October 10, 2023, Gix Media and Leumi entered into a second addendum to the Financing Agreement (the Second
Addendum ), according to which, effective as of September 26, 2023, certain provisions, including among others, the conditions
of the financial covenants contained therein and the interest rate quote, were amended according to the agreed terms between the parties. 

In April 2024, the Company was informed by Cortex, that certain recent developments relating to publishers that are
categorized by a number of programmatic advertisers as Made for Advertising MFA sites, including decisions
made by leading media programmatic advertisers to prioritize different media categories and implement publishing restrictions in connection
with MFA, have materially affected Cortex s business and operations. In connection with the foregoing, a significant customer of
Cortex notified Cortex that in light of the foregoing changes relating to MFA that customer decided to stop advertising on Cortex s
Websites, which decision significantly and negatively impacted Cortex s future revenue streams (the Cortex Adverse Effect ).
Upon receipt of this update, the Company s board of directors convened a meeting to discuss the implications on the Company as well
as potential measures to assist Cortex in mitigating any future economic harm to Cortex and the Company, including (inter alia), assisting
with reducing operating expenses, helping identify new revenues sources for Cortex, participating in any negotiations with Cortex s
and Gix Media s bank regarding the terms of its outstanding loans and business plans in an effort to provide additional liquidity
and ensure continued compliance with Cortex s and Gix Media s obligations towards the bank, and assisting with fundraising
prospects in debt or equity capital in order to help enable Cortex s and Gix Media s continued business and operations. 

On
July 13 2024, Gix Media and Leumi entered into a third addendum to the Financing Agreement according to which, inter alia, effective
as of May 15, 2024 and until August 31, 2024: (i) the Company is obligated to transfer to Gix Media 600,000; (ii) a new covenant, measured
by reference to positive EBTIDA was implemented; (iii) all payments due to the long-term bank loan from Leumi were deferred to August
31, 2024 and from September 1, 2024, payments will be repaid as schedule until the end of the long-term bank loan; (iv) a new 350,000
loan was granted to Gix Media on June 13, 2024, to be repaid until August 30, 2024, alongside the existing credit facility to Gix Media,
which remains equal to 80 of Gix Media s customer balance and (v) Gix Media is obligated to perform a reduction in expenses, including
reduction in force. 

Effective
as of August 30, 2024, Gix Media and Leumi entered into a fourth addendum
to the Financing Agreement, pursuant to which, inter alia: (i) subject to the receipt of at least 2,000,000 from the Company by no later
than January 1, 2025, the existing credit facility to Gix Media shall be extended until February 27, 2025 and (ii) the repayment of the

the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had positive cash flow from operating activities of 1,990 thousand, which was the result
of 10,069 thousand in net loss, 9,093 thousand from positive adjustments to operating activities, and 2,966 thousands from positive
changes in assets and liabilities items. 

There
are no limitations in the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation on the Company s ability to borrow
funds or raise funds through the issuance of shares of its common stock to affect a business combination. 

Gix
Media has provided several liens under the Financing Agreement with Leumi in connection with the Cortex Transaction, including: (1) a
floating lien on Gix Media s assets; (2) a lien on Gix Media s bank account in Leumi; (3) a lien on Gix Media s rights
under the Cortex Transaction; (4) a fixed lien on Gix Media s intellectual property; and (5) a lien on all of Gix Media s
holdings in Cortex. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company has also provided several liens under Financing Agreement with Leumi in connection with the Cortex
Acquisition, as follows: (1) a guarantee to Leumi of all of Gix Media s obligations and undertakings to Leumi, unlimited in amount;
(2) a subordination letter on behalf of the Company to Leumi; (3) a first ranking asset charge over all of the assets of the Company;
and (4) a Deposit Account Control Agreement over the Company s bank accounts. 

According
to the Financing Agreement, Gix Media undertook to meet financial covenant
of positive EBITDA over the life of the loans. As of September 30, 2024, Gix Media is in compliance with the financial covenant in connection
with the Financing Agreement. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company experienced a decrease in its revenues from the digital content and search segments, as a result of the Cortex Adverse Effect,
a decrease in user traffic acquired from third party advertising platforms, an industry-wide decrease in advertising budget, changes
and updates to internet browsers technology, which adversely impacted the Company s ability to acquire traffic in the search
segment and a decrease in revenues from routing of traffic acquired from third-party strategic partners in the search segment, as a result
of lack of availability of suppliers credit from such third party strategic partners. As a result of the foregoing, the Company s
operations were adversely affected. 

The
decline in revenues and other circumstances described above raise substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern during the 12-month period following the issuance date of this Quarterly Report. 

Management s
response to these conditions included reduction of salaries and related expenses and reduction of professional services in the
research and development, selling and marketing functions, reduction of other operational expenses, such as lease costs and
overheads, as well as creation of new partnerships and other new income sources. In addition, the Company entered into facility
agreements and a private placement agreement, through which it has raised capital. Additionally, the Company plans to effect the Uplist and
submitted an application to the Nasdaq, after which, if the Uplist is successful, in accordance with the terms of the aforesaid
private placement and facility agreements, the Company is expected to receive additional funds. Furthermore, the Company s
subsidiaries entered into an addendum to the loan agreement with Leumi pursuant to which loans repayments were deferred while
short term credit lines with Leumi continued to be utilized. However, there is significant uncertainty as to whether the
Company will further succeed in implementing its plans or be able to secure additional funds when needed.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted an evaluation (the Evaluation regarding the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act). Based upon the Evaluation, as required by Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, the Company s chief executive officer and
chief financial officer concluded that, and pursuant to the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework (2013), the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of September
30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors identified in connection with the evaluation required
by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We
are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results
of operations, except as set forth below. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public
board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the Company,
threatened against or affecting the Company, our common stock, our officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse
decision could have a material adverse effect. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Our
business faces many risks, a number of which are described under the caption Risk Factors in our Annual Report. Other than
as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report. The risks described
in our Annual Report and below may not be the only risks we face. Other risks of which we are not yet aware, or that we currently believe
are not material, may also materially and adversely impact our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances
described in the risk factors contained in our Annual Report or described below occurs, our business, financial condition or results
of operations could be adversely impacted and the value of an investment in our securities could decline. Investors and prospective investors
should consider the risks described in our Annual Report and below, and the information contained under the caption Forward-Looking
Statements and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q before deciding whether to invest in our securities. 

Our
common stock may never be listed on a recognized national exchange 

Our
common stock trades on the OTCQB Pink Sheets. You should not assume that any effort to uplist 
the trading of our common stock to a recognized national exchange would be successful, or if successful, that compliance with the listing
requirements of such recognized national exchange will be maintained, including but not limited to requirements associated with maintenance
of a minimum net worth, minimum stock price, minimum number of shareholders, and ability to establish a sufficient number of market makers.
A failure or inability to uplist the trading of our common stock to a recognized national
exchange, or any failure to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of such recognized national exchange, may materially adversely
affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock. 

In
addition, failure to uplist to a recognize national exchange may adversely impact our ability to finance our operations through investments,
which may in turn may impact our ability to pay our obligations, including under our financing agreements, loan agreements and credit
facilities, when they become due. 

- 47 - 

The
foregoing risks may have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock. 

Unless
and until our common stock is approved for listing on a recognized national exchange, many potential investors may be unwilling to purchase
our common stock 

Our
common stock currently trades on the OTCQB Pink Sheets. Many funds and other potential investors are unable or unwilling to purchase
stocks on the OTCQB Pink Sheets, being required or simply preferring to purchase stocks that have been approved for listing on a recognized
national exchange, such as the Nasdaq or the NYSE. Recognizing this situation, on September 13, 2024, we submitted an application to
 uplist to the Nasdaq. The timing of the Nasdaq uplisting process will depend on a variety
of factors, including, but not limited to, overall market conditions. No assurance can be given that our application will be approved
or that a trading market will develop. Unless and until we successfully uplist , potential
investor interest in our common stock may be muted, which may adversely affect our company and the trading price of our common stock.
The foregoing risks may have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock. 

We
may not be able to retain and attract programmatic advertisers, and the associated payments received from such programmatic advertisers 
ads on websites which have been categorized as Made for Advertising may be adversely affected. 

Certain
recent developments relating to publishers that are categorized by a number of programmatic advertisers as Made for Advertising 
(MFA) sites, including decisions made by leading media programmatic advertisers to prioritize different media categories and implement
publishing restrictions in connection with MFA, have negatively impacted Cortex s business and operations. In connection with the
foregoing, a significant customer of Cortex has decided to stop advertising on Cortex s sites. Additional advertising customers
of Cortex may opt to stop advertising on Cortex s sites, which will impact Cortex s, and as a result thereof, the Company s
current and future revenue streams and results of operations. The foregoing issues could lead to decreased advertiser interest in Cortex s
sites, potentially resulting in lower bids for ad space, and as a result thereof, lower revenues from Cortex s business, and decrease
in the Company s results of operation. 

We
may not be able to receive credit facility to fund our operations, on favorable terms, or at all. 

We
generally finance our operations primarily through a combination of cash flow generated from operations and borrowings under our credit
facilities, loans, and through credit with our vendors. Our ability to access capital through our existing credit facilities and raise
additional capital by expanding our credit facilities on economically favorable terms (including available borrowing line and the rate
of interest charged thereunder) or at all, or if we are in violation of our financial covenants in the future and do not receive a waiver,
depends on our ability to stay in compliance with the Financing Agreement. The Financing Agreement poses certain limitations, as explained
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. In addition, and as a result of the decrease in the Company s revenues, our financial performance
has been negatively impacted, which may affect the terms on which we are able to obtain credit facilities and loans. 

If
adequate capital is not available at the time we need it, we may have to curtail future growth or change our expansion plans, which could
have a material adverse effect on us. 

If
borrowing under our existing credit facilities is reduced, or otherwise becomes unavailable, or we are unable to arrange substitute financing
facilities or other sources of capital, our ability to fund our operations would be impaired, which would have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations. 

- 48 - 

We
may be unable to pay our obligations when they become due, including under the Financing Agreement. 

We
have financed our acquisitions principally through the raising of debt, credit facilities, and our operations through credit with our
vendors. Our ability to continue our operations and to pay our obligations, including under the Financing Agreement and credit facilities
(as described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report), when they become due is contingent upon obtaining additional financing. 

In
addition, during August 2024, we renegotiated the terms of the Financing Agreement and entered into the Fourth Addendum to the Financing
Agreement. The availability of the credit facilities to Gix Media is subject to us successfully raising additional capital and depositing
at least 2,000,000 with Gix Media. If the Company, Cortex and Gix Media cannot maintain compliance with the terms and covenant of the
Financing Agreement, or if we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, we may be required to reduce the scope of
our planned operations, and/or consider reductions in personnel costs or other operating costs, in addition to the measures currently
contemplated pursuant to the Financing Agreement.
