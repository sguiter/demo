Emerging
Opportunity in Xenotransplantation 

Beyond
the post-exposure treatment of infectious disease disorders, Sigyn Therapy TM offers a potential preventative strategy to reduce
the spread of infection in organ transplantations, including xenotransplantation, an emerging field related to the transplantation of
an organ from a donor animal species into a human recipient. The advancement of xenotransplantation is being fueled by a global shortage
of transplantable human organs and the recent emergence of gene-editing technologies that have increased the compatibility of porcine-derived
(pig) kidneys for human transplantation. In the United States, approximately 90,000 individuals are on the waitlist for a kidney transplant,
yet fewer than 30,000 kidney transplants are performed each year. 

To
optimize xenotransplantation outcomes, Sigyn Therapy TM is proposed for administration to: 

1. 
 Gene-edited donor pigs to reduce pathogen accumulation in donor
kidneys prior to their extraction for human transplantation. The feasibility of Sigyn Therapy TM administration has been demonstrated
in eight (8) porcine subjects to date. 

2. 
 Human transplant recipients during and after transplantation
to reduce the bloodstream presence of pathogen, inflammatory and other circulating factors that may cause severe illness or induce the
rejection of a transplanted organ, whose source may be either a human or animal donor. 

This
use of Sigyn Therapy TM in these applications corresponds with published FDA guidance on the need for strategies to mitigate
the risk of a known or unknown pathogen being transmitted from a porcine-derived organ to a human transplant recipient. 

Devices
to Optimize the Benefit of Cancer Therapies 

We
are not a developer of drugs to treat cancer. We are a developer of medical devices to optimize the benefit of drugs to treat cancer,
the 2 nd leading cause of death in the United States. Our therapeutic candidates include the ImmunePrep TM platform
to enhance the performance of immunotherapeutic antibodies, ChemoPrep TM to improve the delivery of chemotherapy, and ChemoPure TM
 to extract off-target chemotherapy from the bloodstream to reduce treatment toxicity. 

ImmunePrep TM
 to Optimize Immunotherapeutic Antibodies 

Immunotherapeutic
antibodies (monoclonal antibodies, therapeutic antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, antibody drug conjugates) generate more revenues than
any other class of drug to treat cancer and are the most valued assets in global medicine based on 2023 and 2024 M A transactions.
However, therapeutic antibodies are poorly delivered to their intended cancer targets and as a result, most patients don t respond
to therapy. In many cases, less than 2 of an antibody dose will reach its cancer target, yet a significant portion of same dose can
be intercepted by high concentrations of circulating decoys that display the antigen binding site of the antibody. 

In
response, we invented the ImmunePrep TM platform to allow for a therapeutic antibody to be immobilized within an extracorporeal
circuit to sweep antibody decoys out of the bloodstream prior to the subsequent infusion of the antibody to a patient. We believe this
reverse decoy mechanism will improve targeted antibody delivery and simultaneously reduce the circulating presence of the antibody s
cancer targets to further enhance patient benefit. As a platform technology, ImmunePrep TM allows for the potential development
of products that may incorporate a development-stage, clinical-stage or market-approved antibody. Based on previous FDA interactions,
we believe ImmunePrep TM products that incorporate market-approved antibodies may have an accelerated pathway to potential
market clearance. 

ChemoPrep TM
 to Optimize Chemotherapy Delivery 

Chemotherapeutic
agents are the most commonly administered class of drug to treat cancer, yet only a small fraction of infused doses reach their cancer
cell targets. Contributing to inadequate delivery are high concentrations of tumor-derived exosomes, whose bloodstream presence disrupts
chemotherapy delivery and corresponds with treatment resistance. We designed ChemoPrep TM to reduce the circulating presence
of tumor-derived exosomes prior chemotherapy administration. Our clinical goal is to maintain or improve the efficacy of chemotherapy
with lower doses, which would reduce treatment toxicity. In this regard, ChemoPrep TM aligns with the FDA Project Optimus 
initiative to minimize the toxicity of cancer drugs while maximizing patient benefit. 

ChemoPure TM
 to Reduce Chemotherapy Toxicity 

Once
chemotherapy has been administered, residual off-target chemotherapy that is left to circulate in the bloodstream is more likely to cause
patient harm versus benefit. In response, we designed ChemoPure TM to extract off-target chemotherapy from the bloodstream
to further reduce treatment toxicity.

Merger
Transaction 

On
October 19, 2020, Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc, a Delaware corporation (the Registrant formerly known as Reign Resources Corporation,
completed a Share Exchange Agreement (the Agreement with Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc., a private entity incorporated in the
State of Delaware on October 19, 2019. 

In
the Share Exchange Agreement, we acquired of the issued and outstanding shares of privately held Sigyn Therapeutics common stock
in exchange for of the fully paid and nonassessable shares of our common stock outstanding (the Acquisition ). In conjunction
with the transaction, we changed our name from Reign Resources Corporation to Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc. pursuant to an amendment to our
articles of incorporation that was filed with the State of Delaware. Subsequently, our trading symbol was changed to SIGY. The Acquisition
was treated by the Company as a reverse merger in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). 

Reverse
Stock Split 

Effective
January 19, 2024, Board of Directors declared a to shareholders of record on or before January 31,
2024 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, outstanding warrants and options, and the Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock. The number of shares of common stock and convertible preferred shares obtainable upon exercise or conversion and the
exercise prices and conversion rate have been equitably adjusted. As such, all share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted
to reflect the reverse stock split. 

at September 30, 2024, had a working capital deficit of at September 30, 2024, had net losses of 
and , and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net cash
used in operating activities of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with no
revenue earned since inception, and a lack of operational history. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. 

While
the Company is attempting to expand operations and generate revenues, the Company s cash position will not be significant
enough to support the Company s daily operations for the foreseeable future. Management intends to raise additional funds by
way of a private offering, public offering, or an asset sale transaction. Management believes that the actions presently being taken
to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.
While management believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds or
transact an asset sale, there can be no assurances to that effect or on terms acceptable to the Company. The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate
revenues. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern for
a year from the date of issuance.

and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets
are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are
included in income in the year of disposition. 

Level
 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets
 or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
 market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level
 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the
 fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

The
carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial
assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. There
were no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets and
liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. There
have been no transfers between levels. 

Credit
risk 

The
Company is exposed to credit risk from its cash in banks. The credit risk on cash in banks is limited because the counterparties are
recognized financial institutions. 

Seasonality 

The
business is not subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations. 

Major
Suppliers 

Sigyn
Therapy TM is comprised of components that are supplied by various industry vendors. Additionally, the Company is reliant on
third-party organizations to conduct clinical development studies that are necessary to advance Sigyn Therapy TM toward the
marketplace. 

Should
the relationship with an industry vendor or third-party clinical development organization be interrupted or discontinued, it is believed
that alternate component suppliers and third-party clinical development organizations could be identified to support the continued advancement
of Sigyn Therapy TM .

per month commencing June 15, 2021
and ending on September 30, 2026. The Company accounts for this lease in accordance with ASC 842. Adoption of the standard resulted in the
initial recognition of operating lease ROU asset of and operating lease liability of as of June 15, 2021. 

Operating
lease right-of-use ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease
payments over the lease term. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent
our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Generally, the implicit rate of interest in arrangements is not readily
determinable and the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company s
incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on its understanding of what its credit rating would be. The operating lease
ROU asset includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our variable lease payments primarily consist of maintenance
and other operating expenses from our real estate leases. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities
and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Our lease terms may include options to extend
or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

We
have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. We have elected to account for these lease and non-lease components as a single
lease component. We are also electing not to apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases of twelve months or less and instead
will recognize lease payments as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

The
components of lease expense and supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the period are as follows:

Business
Overview 

Sigyn
Therapeutics, Inc. Sigyn , the Company we, us, or our develops medical devices to treat cancer and infectious disease disorders. We believe our lineup of therapeutic candidates is among
the most expansive in the field of extracorporeal blood purification. To optimize the benefit of drugs to treat cancer, we invented
the ImmunePrep TM platform to enhance the performance of immunotherapeutic antibodies; ChemoPrep TM 
to improve the delivery of chemotherapy; and ChemoPure TM to reduce chemotherapy toxicity. Our lead therapeutic
candidate is Sigyn Therapy TM designed to address infectious disease disorders that are not treatable with drugs.
If successfully advanced, our therapies may provide strategic value to the pharmaceutical, dialysis, and organ transplant
industry. 

Infectious
Disease Disorders 

To
address infectious disease disorders that are not treatable with drugs, we designed Sigyn Therapy TM to extract deadly pathogens
and toxins from a patient s bloodstream, while simultaneously providing a mechanism to dampen down excessive immune responses that
are associated with life-threatening infections. Sigyn Therapy TM has been validated to extract viral pathogens, bacterial
toxins (including endotoxin), hepatic toxins and inflammatory cytokines from human blood plasma. These expansive capabilities establish
Sigyn Therapy TM as a novel strategy to address several unmet needs in global health: 

1. 
 Untreatable viral pathogens (most of the 200+ viruses
that infect humans are not treatable with drugs) 

2.

Previous
Infectious Disease Industry Achievements 

The
Company s management has relevant experience in developing blood purification technologies to treat infectious disease disorders.
Most members of our team previously worked alongside our CEO while overseeing development of the first medical device to receive FDA
 Emergency Use Authorization approval to treat an infectious viral pathogen (Ebola) and the first to receive two Breakthrough
Device designation awards from FDA. As a result of these achievements, TIME Magazine named the device to its list of Top
Inventions and Top Medical Breakthroughs. 

Sigyn
Therapy TM Human Studies 

First-in-human
clinical studies of Sigyn Therapy TM plan to enroll end-stage renal disease (ESRD) subjects with endotoxemia and concurrent
inflammation, which are prevalent, yet untreatable conditions that shorten the lives of dialysis patients. Approximately 550,000 individuals
suffer from ESRD in the United States. A therapeutic strategy that helps to extend the lives of ESRD patients may have quantifiable value
to the dialysis industry, which is dominated by Fresenius Medical Care and DaVita, Inc. in North America. Based on the number of ESRD
patients treated in their networks, every month of extended life would equate to approximately 1 billion in added revenues for each
company. 

Emerging
Opportunity in Xenotransplantation 

Beyond
the post-exposure treatment of infectious disease disorders, Sigyn Therapy TM offers a potential preventative strategy to reduce
the spread of infection in organ transplantations, including xenotransplantation, an emerging field related to the transplantation of
an organ from a donor animal species into a human recipient. The advancement of xenotransplantation is being fueled by a global shortage
of transplantable human organs and the recent emergence of gene-editing technologies that have increased the compatibility of porcine-derived
(pig) kidneys for human transplantation. In the United States, approximately 90,000 individuals are on the waitlist for a kidney transplant,
yet fewer than 30,000 kidney transplants are performed each year. 

To
optimize xenotransplantation outcomes, Sigyn Therapy TM is proposed for administration to: 

1. 
 Gene-edited donor pigs to reduce pathogen accumulation in donor
kidneys prior to their extraction for human transplantation. The feasibility of Sigyn Therapy TM administration has been demonstrated
in eight (8) porcine subjects to date. 

2. 
 Human transplant recipients during and after transplantation
to reduce the bloodstream presence of pathogen, inflammatory and other circulating factors that may cause severe illness or induce the
rejection of a transplanted organ, whose source may be either a human or animal donor. 

27 

This
use of Sigyn Therapy TM in these applications corresponds with published FDA guidance on the need for strategies to mitigate
the risk of a known or unknown pathogen being transmitted from a porcine-derived organ to a human transplant recipient. 

Devices
to Optimize the Benefit of Cancer Therapies 

We
are not a developer of drugs to treat cancer. We are a developer of medical devices to optimize the benefit of drugs to treat cancer,
the 2 nd leading cause of death in the United States. Our therapeutic candidates include the ImmunePrep TM platform
to enhance the performance of immunotherapeutic antibodies, ChemoPrep TM to improve the delivery of chemotherapy, and ChemoPure TM
 to extract off-target chemotherapy from the bloodstream to reduce treatment toxicity. 

ImmunePrep TM
 to Optimize Immunotherapeutic Antibodies 

Immunotherapeutic
antibodies (monoclonal antibodies, therapeutic antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, antibody drug conjugates) generate more revenues than
any other class of drug to treat cancer and are the most valued assets in global medicine based on 2023 and 2024 M A transactions.
However, therapeutic antibodies are poorly delivered to their intended cancer targets and, as a result, most patients don t respond
to therapy. In many cases, less than 2 of an antibody dose will reach its cancer target, yet a significant portion of same dose can
be intercepted by high concentrations of circulating decoys that display the antigen binding site of the antibody. 

In
response, we invented the ImmunePrep TM platform to allow for a therapeutic antibody to be immobilized within an extracorporeal
circuit to sweep antibody decoys out of the bloodstream prior to the subsequent infusion of the antibody to a patient. We believe this
reverse decoy mechanism will improve targeted antibody delivery and simultaneously reduce the circulating presence of the antibody s
cancer targets to further enhance patient benefit. As a platform technology, ImmunePrep TM allows for the potential development
of products that may incorporate a development-stage, clinical-stage or market-approved antibody. Based on previous FDA interactions,
we believe ImmunePrep TM products that incorporate market-approved antibodies may have an accelerated pathway to potential
market clearance. 

ChemoPrep TM
 to Optimize Chemotherapy Delivery 

Chemotherapeutic
agents are the most commonly administered class of drug to treat cancer, yet only a small fraction of infused doses reach their cancer
cell targets. Contributing to inadequate delivery are high concentrations of tumor-derived exosomes, whose bloodstream presence disrupts
chemotherapy delivery and corresponds with treatment resistance. We designed ChemoPrep TM to reduce the circulating presence
of tumor-derived exosomes prior chemotherapy administration. Our clinical goal is to maintain or improve the efficacy of chemotherapy
with lower doses, which would reduce treatment toxicity. In this regard, ChemoPrep TM aligns with the FDA Project Optimus 
initiative to minimize the toxicity of cancer drugs while maximizing patient benefit. 

ChemoPure TM
 to Reduce Chemotherapy Toxicity 

Once
chemotherapy has been administered, residual off-target chemotherapy that is left to circulate in the bloodstream is more likely to cause
patient harm versus benefit. In response, we designed ChemoPure TM to extract off-target chemotherapy from the bloodstream
to further reduce treatment toxicity. 

About
Sigyn Therapy TM - Our Lead Therapeutic Candidate 

To
address infectious disease disorders that are not treatable with drugs, we designed Sigyn Therapy TM to extract deadly pathogens
and toxins from a patient s bloodstream, while simultaneously providing a mechanism to dampen down excessive immune responses that
are associated with life-threatening infections. Sigyn Therapy TM has been validated to extract viral pathogens, bacterial
toxins (including endotoxin), hepatic toxins and inflammatory cytokines from human blood plasma. These expansive capabilities establish
Sigyn Therapy TM as a novel strategy to address several unmet needs in global health, including untreatable viral pathogens,
antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, endotoxemia, and sepsis. 

28 

Sigyn
Therapy TM Pre-Clinical Studies 

Since
the inception of our Company, we have advanced Sigyn Therapy TM from conceptual design through completion of pre-clinical in
vitro studies that have quantified the reduction of relevant therapeutic targets from human blood plasma with small-scale versions
of Sigyn Therapy TM . These include endotoxin (gram-negative bacterial toxin); peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid (gram-positive
bacterial toxins); viral pathogens (including SARS-CoV-2); hepatic toxins (ammonia, bile acid, and bilirubin); and tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which are pro-inflammatory cytokines whose dysregulated production
(the cytokine storm) precipitate sepsis and play a prominent role in each of our therapeutic opportunities. 

Sigyn
Therapy TM Animal Studies 

Subsequent
to our pre-clinical in vitro studies, we disclosed the completion of in vivo animal studies. In these studies, Sigyn Therapy TM
 was administered via standard dialysis machines utilizing conventional blood-tubing sets, for periods of up to six hours to eight
(8) porcine (pig) subjects, each weighing approximately 40-45 kilograms. The studies were comprised of a pilot phase (two subjects),
which evaluated the feasibility of the study protocol in the first-in-mammal use of Sigyn Therapy TM ; and an expansion phase
(six subjects) to further assess treatment feasibility and refine pre-treatment set-up and operating procedures. There were no serious
adverse events reported in any of the treated animal subjects. Of the eight treatments, seven were administered for the entire six-hour
treatment period. One treatment was halted early due to the observation of a clot in the device, which was believed to be the result
of a procedural deviation in the pre-treatment set-up. Important criteria for treatment feasibility including hemodynamic parameters,
serum chemistries and hematologic measurements were stable across all subjects. 

The
studies were conducted by a clinical team at Innovative BioTherapies, Inc. IBT ), under a contract with the University
of Michigan to utilize animal care, associated institutional review oversight, as well as surgical suite facilities located within the
North Campus Research Complex. The treatment protocol of the study was reviewed and approved by the University of Michigan Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee IACUC ). 

The
animal studies were conducted to correspond with FDA s best practice guidance. The number of animals enrolled in our study and
the amount of data collected was based on the ethical and least burdensome principles that underlie the FDA goal of using the minimum
number of animals necessary to generate valid scientific data to demonstrate reasonable feasibility and performance of a medical device
prior to human study consideration. A porcine animal model is a generally accepted model for the study of extracorporeal blood purification
devices intended to treat infectious disease and inflammatory disorders. Regardless of these factors, FDA may require that we conduct
additional animal studies. 

Sigyn
Therapy TM Clinical Plan 

The
data resulting from our in vivo animal and pre-clinical in vitro studies has been incorporated in an Investigational Device
Exemption (IDE) that we have drafted for submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA to support first-in-human
feasibility studies of Sigyn Therapy TM . The clinical plan of our IDE proposes to enroll 12-15 End-Stage Renal Disease ESRD patients with endotoxemia and concurrent inflammation at three clinical site locations that have been identified and evaluated by a contract
research organization that specializes in ESRD related clinical studies. The primary study objective is to demonstrate that Sigyn Therapy TM
 can be safely administered to health compromised ESRD subjects. Additionally, we plan to quantify changes in endotoxin levels as
well as markers of inflammation as secondary endpoints. The clinical plan proposed in our draft IDE has not yet been provided to FDA
and there is no assurance that FDA will approve the initiation of our proposed feasibility study, nor is there any assurance that we
will receive FDA market approval of Sigyn Therapy TM . 

Based
on our previous experience in developing extracorporeal blood purification therapies, we believe we have collected sufficient data to
support first-in-human studies of Sigyn Therapy TM . However, Sigyn Therapy TM is a Class III device that requires
extensive pre-clinical and clinical studies to be conducted along with the submission of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application prior
to market clearance consideration by FDA. 

29 

Sigyn
 Therapy TM Mechanism of Action 

We
designed Sigyn Therapy TM to treat life-threatening infectious disease disorders that are not addressed with drug therapies.
Based on its ability to extract viral pathogens, bacterial toxins (including endotoxin), hepatic toxins and inflammatory cytokines from
human blood plasma, Sigyn Therapy TM establishes a novel strategy to address several unmet needs in global health. These include
untreatable viral pathogens, antibiotic resistant bacterial infections, endotoxemia, and sepsis. 

To
support widespread implementation, Sigyn Therapy TM is a single-use disposable device that is deployable on the global infrastructure
of hemodialysis and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) machines already located in hospitals and clinics. To reduce the risk
of blood clotting and hemolysis, the anticoagulant heparin is administered, which is the standard-of-care drug administered in dialysis
and CRRT therapies. During animal studies conducted at the University of Michigan, Sigyn Therapy TM was deployed for use on
a dialysis machine manufactured by Fresenius Medical Care, a global leader in the dialysis industry. 

Incorporated
within Sigyn Therapy TM is a cocktail of adsorbent components formulated to optimize the broad-spectrum reduction
of therapeutic targets from the bloodstream. In the medical field, the term cocktail is a reference to the simultaneous
administration of multiple drugs (a drug cocktail) with differing mechanisms of actions. While drug cocktails are emerging as potential
mechanisms to treat cancer, they are life-saving countermeasures to treat HIV and Hepatitis-C viral infections. However, dosing of multi-drug
agent cocktails is limited by toxicity and adverse events that can result from deleterious drug interactions. 

Sigyn
Therapy TM is not constrained by such limitations as active adsorbent components are maintained within Sigyn Therapy TM
 and not introduced into the body. As a result, we are able to incorporate a substantial quantity of adsorbent components to capture
therapeutic targets outside of the body as they circulate through Sigyn Therapy TM . Each adsorbent component has differing
capture characteristics that contribute to optimizing the potential of Sigyn Therapy TM to reduce the circulating presence
of both pathogen and inflammatory targets that underly sepsis and other life-threatening infectious disease disorders. 

The
adsorbent components incorporated within Sigyn Therapy TM provide more than 200,000 square meters (~50 acres) of surface area
on which to adsorb and remove therapeutic targets from the bloodstream. Beyond its capacity to reduce the circulating presence of therapeutic
targets we believe Sigyn Therapy TM to be a highly efficient treatment methodology. Based on targeted blood flow rates of 350ml/min,
the entire bloodstream of an average size person can be processed through Sigyn Therapy TM approximately fifteen times during
a single four-hour treatment period. 

From
a technical perspective, Sigyn Therapy TM is a 325mm long polycarbonate column that internally contains polyethersulphone hollow
fibers that have porous walls with a median pore size of ~200 nanometers (nm). As blood flows into Sigyn Therapy TM , plasma
and therapeutic targets below 200nm travel through the porous walls as a result of blood-side pressure. As the hollow fiber bundle within
Sigyn Therapy TM creates a resistance to the flow of blood, a pressure drop is created along the length of the device such
that the blood-side pressure is higher at the blood inlet and lower at the blood outlet. This allows for plasma and therapeutic targets
to flow away from the blood and into the extra-lumen space (inside the polycarbonate shell, yet outside the hollow-fiber bundle) to interact
with Sigyn Therapy TM adsorbent components in a low shear force environment. In the distal third of the fiber bundle, the pressure
gradient is reversed, which allows for plasma to flow back through the fiber walls to be reconvened into the bloodstream without the
presence of therapeutic targets that were captured or bound by adsorbent components housed in the extra-lumen space of Sigyn Therapy TM . 

Opportunities
to Address Unmet Needs in Global Health 

Based
on data obtained during pre-clinical in vitro validation studies, we are advancing Sigyn Therapy TM to address several
unmet needs in global health. These include untreatable viral pathogen, antibiotic resistant bacterial infections, endotoxemia, and sepsis. 

Untreatable
Viral Pathogens 

A
majority of 200+ viruses that are known to be infectious to humans are not treatable with drug therapies. Furthermore, newly emerging
viruses will remain drug-resistant until a corresponding drug is developed and demonstrated to be safe and effective in human studies.
As a result, extracorporeal blood purification therapies are increasingly being deployed as first-line treatment countermeasures. 

30 

The
first blood purification device to receive FDA Emergency-Use Authorization approval to treat a pandemic virus was the Hemopurifier to
treat Ebola, which occurred under the leadership of our CEO at a previous company. Subsequently, the first therapies to receive FDA Emergency-Use
Authorization to treat Covid-19 were blood purification therapies from Terumo BCT, ExThera Medical Corporation, CytoSorbents, Inc., and
Baxter Healthcare Corporation. In connection with these approvals, FDA published a statement that blood purification devices may be effective
at treating patients with confirmed COVID-19 by reducing various pathogens, cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators from their bloodstream. 

Consistent
with FDA s statement, pediatric versions of Sigyn Therapy TM have demonstrated an ability to reduce the presence of various
pathogens, cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators from human blood plasma. As such, we believe Sigyn Therapy TM offers
an important candidate strategy to treat future pandemic outbreaks, which are increasingly being fueled by a confluence of global warming,
urban crowding, and intercontinental travel. 

Additionally,
as many infectious viruses are not addressed with a corresponding drug or vaccine, there may be an ongoing need for blood purification
technologies that offer to reduce the severity of infection and mitigate the excess production of inflammatory cytokines (the cytokine
storm) associated with high mortality in non-pandemic viral infections. Sigyn Therapy TM also aligns with government initiatives
to support the development of broad-spectrum medical countermeasures that could help mitigate the impact of an emerging pandemic or bioterror
threat yet may also have viability in established disease indications. 

Antibiotic-Resistant
Bacterial Infections 

According
to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC ), nearly three million individuals are infected with antibiotic
resistant bacterial infections in the U.S. each year, which results in more than 35,000 deaths. The United Nations reported approximately
5 million deaths worldwide in 2019 were associated with antimicrobial drug resistance and projects the annual death toll could increase
to 10 million by 2050 in the absence of new therapeutic advances. Based on its broad-spectrum mechanism to extract bacterial toxins and
inflammatory mediators from the bloodstream, Sigyn Therapy TM may provide a novel strategy to assist in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant
bacterial infections. 

Endotoxemia

Endotoxin
is a gram-negative bacterial toxin whose bloodstream presence commonly induces sepsis, the leading cause of death in U.S. hospitals.
Our initial clinical focus is directed toward the treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who suffer from endotoxemia and
concurrent inflammation, which are prevalent, yet untreatable conditions that shorten the lives of dialysis patients. 

According
to the United States Renal Data System USRDS ), more than 550,000 individuals have ESRD, which results in approximately
85 million kidney dialysis treatments being administered in the United States each year. A therapy that could help extend the lives of
these patients may have a quantifiable value to the dialysis industry, which is dominated by Fresenius Medical Care and DaVita, Inc.
in North America. Based on the number of ESRD patients treated in their networks, every month of extended life would equate to approximately
 1 billion in added revenues for each company. 

Sepsis 

Sepsis
is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In January of 2020, a report
entitled; Global, Regional, and National Sepsis Incidence and Mortality, 1990-2017: Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease
Study, reported 48.9 million cases of sepsis and 11 million deaths in 2017. In that same year, an estimated 20.3 million sepsis
cases and 2.9 million deaths were among children younger than 5-years old. The report included a reference that sepsis kills more people
around the world than all forms of cancer combined. In the United States, sepsis was reported to be the most common cause of hospital
deaths with an annual financial burden that exceeds 24 billion. 

To
date, more than 100 human studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of candidate drugs to treat sepsis. With one
brief exception (Xigris, Eli Lilly), none of these studies resulted in a market cleared therapy. As sepsis remains beyond the reach of
single-target drugs, there is a growing interest in multi-mechanism therapies that can simultaneously address both inflammatory and pathogen
associated targets. Sigyn Therapy TM offers to addresses a broad-spectrum of pathogen sources and the resulting dysregulated
cytokine production (the cytokine storm) that is a hallmark of sepsis. 

31 

Emerging
Opportunity for Sigyn Therapy TM in Xenotransplantation 

Beyond
the post-exposure treatment of infectious disease disorders, Sigyn Therapy TM offers a potential preventative strategy to reduce
the spread of infection in organ transplantation, including xenotransplantation, an emerging field related to the transplantation of
an organ from a donor animal species into a human recipient. The advancement of xenotransplantation is being fueled by a global shortage
of transplantable human organs and the recent emergence of gene-editing technologies that have increased the compatibility of porcine-derived
(pig) kidneys for human transplantation. In the United States, approximately 90,000 individuals are on the waitlist for a kidney transplant,
yet fewer than 30,000 kidney transplants are performed each year. 

To
optimize xenotransplantation outcomes, Sigyn Therapy TM is proposed for administration to: 

1. 
 Gene-edited donor pigs to reduce pathogen accumulation in donor
kidneys prior to their extraction for human transplantation. The feasibility of Sigyn Therapy TM administration has been demonstrated
in eight (8) porcine subjects to date. 

2. 
 Human transplant recipients during and after transplantation
to reduce the bloodstream presence of pathogen, inflammatory and other circulating factors that may cause severe illness or induce the
rejection of a transplanted organ, whose source may be either a human or animal donor. 

This
use of Sigyn Therapy TM in these applications corresponds with published FDA guidance on the need for strategies to mitigate
the risk of a known or unknown pathogen being transmitted from a porcine-derived organ to a human transplant recipient. 

Devices
to Optimize the Benefit of Cancer Therapies 

We
are not a developer of drugs to treat cancer. We are a developer of medical devices to optimize the benefit of drugs to treat cancer,
the 2 nd leading cause of death in the United States. Our therapeutic candidates include the ImmunePrep TM platform
to enhance the performance of immunotherapeutic antibodies, ChemoPrep TM to improve the delivery of chemotherapy, and ChemoPure TM
 to extract off-target chemotherapy from the bloodstream to reduce treatment toxicity. At present, we do not have any market approved
products to treat cancer and there is no assurance that we will commercialize any of our proposed cancer therapies. 

Unlike
Sigyn Therapy TM to treat infectious disease disorders, the intent of ImmunePrep TM and ChemoPrep TM is
to optimize the delivery of leading drugs to treat cancer, while ChemoPure TM introduces a strategy to reduce chemotherapy
toxicity. Additionally, Sigyn Therapy TM is a hollow fiber-based device deployed for use on dialysis and continuous renal replacement
machines. Whereas ImmunePrep TM , ChemoPrep TM and ChemoPure TM do not contain hollow-fibers and are intended
for use on portable blood processing systems that can be located within the clinical sites where cancer therapies are infused to patients.
During treatment, the functionality of the blood processing system allows for patient blood plasma to flow through our devices, which
in the case of ImmunePrep TM products, therapeutic antibodies are immobilized for selective elimination of drug decoys and
antibody therapeutic targets from the bloodstream. ChemoPrep TM and ChemoPure TM incorporate adsorbent components
to reduce the circulating presence of particles that interfere with chemotherapy delivery and to extract off-target chemotherapy from
the bloodstream as a means to reduce toxicity. 

ImmunePrep TM
 to Optimize Immunotherapeutic Antibodies 

Immunotherapeutic
antibodies (monoclonal antibodies, therapeutic antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, antibody drug conjugates) generate more revenues than
any other class of drug to treat cancer and are the most valued assets in global medicine based on 2023 and 2024 M A transactions.
However, therapeutic antibodies are poorly delivered to their intended cancer targets and as a result, most patients don t respond
to therapy. In many cases, less than 2 of an antibody dose will reach its cancer target, yet a significant portion of same dose can
be intercepted by high concentrations of circulating decoys that display the antigen binding site of the antibody. 

In
response, we invented the ImmunePrep TM platform to allow for a therapeutic antibody to be immobilized within an extracorporeal

reverse decoy mechanism will improve targeted antibody delivery and simultaneously reduce the circulating presence of the antibody s
cancer targets to further enhance patient benefit. As a platform technology, ImmunePrep TM allows for the potential development
of products that may incorporate a development-stage, clinical-stage or market-approved antibody. Based on previous FDA interactions,
we believe ImmunePrep TM products that incorporate market-approved antibodies may have an accelerated pathway to potential
market clearance. 

32 

ChemoPrep TM
 to Optimize Chemotherapy Delivery 

Chemotherapeutic
agents are the most commonly administered class of drug to treat cancer, yet only a small fraction of infused doses reach their cancer
cell targets. Contributing to inadequate delivery are high concentrations of tumor-derived exosomes, whose bloodstream presence disrupts
chemotherapy delivery and corresponds with treatment resistance. We designed ChemoPrep TM to reduce the circulating presence
of tumor-derived exosomes prior chemotherapy administration. Our clinical goal is to maintain or improve the efficacy of chemotherapy
with lower doses, which would reduce treatment toxicity. In this regard, ChemoPrep TM aligns with the FDA Project Optimus 
initiative to minimize the toxicity of cancer drugs while maximizing patient benefit. 

ChemoPure TM

Once
chemotherapy has been administered, residual off-target chemotherapy that is left to circulate in the bloodstream is more likely to cause
patient harm versus benefit. In response, we designed ChemoPure TM to extract off-target chemotherapy from the bloodstream
to further reduce treatment toxicity. 

Marketing
and Sales 

Our
primary focus is the regulatory and clinical advancement of Sigyn Therapy TM and the continued development of our cancer treatment
technologies. We do not market or sell any therapeutic products at this time. However, we may choose to forge relationships with organizations
that have established distribution channels into markets that may have a demand for our therapies should they receive market clearance
from FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
own the intellectual property rights to pending royalty-free patents that have been assigned to us by our CEO and other employee inventors.
We have also received a Notice of Allowance from the USPTO related to the use of Sigyn Therapeutics, Sigyn Therapy TM ,
and the protection of our corporate logo. We plan to continually expand our intellectual property portfolio and protect trade secrets
that are not the subject of patent submissions. However, there is no assurance that the claims of current pending and future patent applications
will result in issued patents. Pending changes in patent law, it is anticipated that each patent that becomes issued will have an enforceable
life that will extend for a period of 20 years from the initial patent filing date (i.e., the priority date) and will expire at the end
of such 20-year terms. 

At
present, we own the rights to the following patents pending.

Government
Regulation 

In
the United States, our medical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA. Should we seek to commercialize our products outside the
United States, we expect to face comparable international regulatory oversight. The U.S. regulatory jurisdiction for extracorporeal blood
purification therapies is the Center for Devices and Radiological Health CDRH ), the FDA branch that oversees the market
approval of medical devices. 

Based
on published CDRH guidance, we believe that each of our therapeutic candidates will be classified as Class III medical devices that are
subject to a Pre-Market Approval PMA submission pathway. A PMA pathway requires extensive data, including but not limited
to technical documents, preclinical studies, animal studies, human clinical trials, the establishment of Current Good Manufacturing Practices cGMPs standards and labelling that fulfils FDA s requirement to demonstrate reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness
of a medical device product. However, as our therapeutic candidates do not emit electronic product radiation, they will not be subject
to regulatory challenges associated with medical devices that emit electronic radiation. 

The
commercialization of medical devices in the United States requires either a prior 510(k) clearance, unless it is exempt, or a PMA from
the FDA. Generally, if a new device has a predicate that is already on the market under a 510(k) clearance, the FDA will allow that new
device to be marketed under a 510(k) clearance; otherwise, a premarket approval, or PMA, is required. Medical devices are classified
into one of three classes; Class I, Class II or Class III which are determined by the degree of risk associated with each medical device
and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk
and are subject to the general controls of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, such as provisions that relate to: adulteration;
misbranding; registration and listing; notification, including repair, replacement, or refund; records and reports; and good manufacturing
practices. Most Class I devices are classified as exempt from pre-market notification under section 510(k) of the FD C Act, and therefore
may be commercially distributed without obtaining 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Class II devices are subject to both general controls
and special controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Special controls include performance standards, post
market surveillance, patient registries and guidance documents. A manufacturer may be required to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification
requesting permission to commercially distribute some Class II devices. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as
life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k)
device, are placed in Class III. A Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after
submission of a PMA. We believe that all of our therapeutic candidates will be classified as a Class III device and as such will be subject
to a PMA submission and approval. 

Should
Sigyn Therapy TM or any of our other therapeutic candidates receive market clearance from FDA, we would need to comply with
applicable laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, storage, distribution, advertising
and promotion, and post-marketing surveillance reporting for medical devices. Failure to comply with these applicable requirements may
subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as issuance of warning letters, import detentions,
civil monetary penalties and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Our failure to comply
with any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

34 

The
Pre-market Approval Pathway 

A
pre-market approval PMA application must be submitted to FDA for Class III devices requiring a PMA. The PMA application
process is more demanding than the 510(k)-pre-market notification process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including
but not limited to technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA s satisfaction
reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of the device. 

After
a PMA application is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive
review and thus whether the FDA will file the application for review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although
the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this
review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel
of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the
approvability of the device. 

Although
the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel s recommendations are important to the FDA decision making process.
In addition, the FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality System
Regulation, or QSR. The agency also may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA s regulations. 

Upon
completion of the PMA review, the FDA may: (i) approve the PMA which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information
for one or more indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates
the FDA s belief that the PMA is approvable and states what additional information the FDA requires, or the post-approval commitments
that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii) issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which are
typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time
consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If the FDA issues an approvable or not approvable
letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which the FDA s review clock is reset. 

Clinical
Trials 

Clinical
trials are almost always required to support PMA market clearance and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the United States,
for significant risk Class III devices, these trials require submission of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application to the
FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to
test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a
specific number of patients at specified study sites. During the trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA s IDE requirements
for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously
follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting
and record keeping requirements. Clinical trials for Class III devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA
and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that
has been formally designated to review and monitor medical research involving subjects and which has the authority to approve, require
modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety and welfare of human research subjects. The FDA or the IRB at
each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may withdraw approval of a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including
a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits or a failure to comply with FDA or IRB requirements. Even if a trial
is completed, there is no assurance that clinical testing will demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of Sigyn Therapy TM 
or other pipeline devices. 

35 

Manufacturing
and Procurement 

At
present, we plan to manufacture Sigyn Therapy TM and other candidate products through contracts with FDA registered Contract
Manufacturing Organizations (CMO) to establish cGMPs compliant manufacturing to support human clinical studies and potential commercialization
should we receive clearance from FDA to market one or more of our products. We plan to establish manufacturing procedure specifications
that define each stage of our manufacturing, inspection and testing processes and the control parameters or acceptance criteria that
apply to each activity that result in the production of our technologies. 

We
have also established relationships with industry vendors that provide components necessary to manufacture Sigyn Therapy TM .
Should the relationship with an industry vendor be interrupted or discontinued, we believe that alternate component suppliers can be
identified to support continued manufacturing. However, delays related to interrupted or discontinued vendor relationships could adversely
impact our business. 

Research
and Product Development 

To
date, we have outsourced our research and product development activities, which include the performance of in vitro blood plasma
validation studies, animal studies, pre-cGMPs product assembly and manufacturing through third party organizations with experience in
advancing extracorporeal blood purification technologies. Our pre-clinical in vitro blood plasma studies we each performed under
an agreement with Innovative BioTherapies, Inc. (IBT) and our animal clinical studies were conducted by IBT team members through a contract
with the University of Michigan to utilize animal care, associated institutional review oversight, as well as surgical suite facilities
located within the North Campus Research Complex. While we maintain ownership rights to all study data collected by IBT, we do permit
for IBT to publish or present the results of our contracted studies. At present, we do not have plans to build and staff our own research
and product development facility. 

Competition 

Our
therapeutic candidates provide a novel approach and are not similar to other products in the marketplace. However, there are there may
be medical device or pharmaceutics companies that may develop products that could compete directly with our therapeutic candidates. If
these companies develop competing products, they have far greater resources to support the clinical advancement and post approval marketing
of their products within the medical industry than we do. 

Environmental
Laws and Regulations 

At
present, our operations are not subject to any environmental laws or regulations.

General

Depending
on the extent of our future growth, we may experience significant strain on our management, personnel, and information systems. We will
need to implement and improve operational, financial, and management information systems. In addition, we are implementing new information
systems that will provide better record-keeping, customer service and billing. However, there can be no assurance that our management
resources or information systems will be sufficient to manage any future growth in our business, and the failure to do so could have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among
other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had an accumulated
deficit of 14,158,906 at September 30, 2024, had a working capital deficit of 4,006,168 and 3,489,941 at September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, respectively, had net losses of 1,196,923 and 2,817,394, and 905,726 and 2,969,886 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities of 582,218 and 1,255,316 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with no revenue earned since inception, and a lack of operational history. These matters raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

While
the Company is attempting to expand operations and generate revenues, the Company s cash position may not be significant enough
to support the Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public offering or an asset
sale transaction. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues
provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While management believes in the viability of its strategy to
generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds or transact an asset sale, there can be no assurances to that effect or
on terms acceptable to the Company. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability
to further implement its business plan and generate revenues. 

39 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a
going concern. 

General
 Overall, we had an increase in cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 153,098 resulting from cash
provided by financing activities of 735,316, offset partially by cash used in operating activities of 582,218. 

The
following is a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities during the periods indicated:

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operations was 582,218
compared to net cash used in operations of 1,255,316 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in operations was primarily
due to a net loss of 2,817,394 for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the changes in operating assets and liabilities of 1,114,944,
primarily due to the changes in accounts payable of 149,997, other current assets of 2,053, accrued payroll and payroll taxes of 969,890,
offset partially by the change in other current liabilities of 6,996. In addition, net cash used in operating activities includes adjustments
to reconcile net profit from depreciation expense of 4,248, stock issued for services of 214,550, warrants issued for services of 15,703,
stock-based compensation of 112,500, accretion of original issuance costs of 324,798, the accretion of debt discount of 423,663, and
modification of warrants of 24,770. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operations was primarily due to a net loss of 2,969,886 and the changes in
operating assets and liabilities of 365,319, primarily due to the increase in accounts payable of 34,112 and accrued payroll and payroll
taxes of 375,124, offset partially by the decrease in other current liabilities of 1,572, and other current assets of 42,345. In addition,
net cash used in operating activities includes adjustments to reconcile net profit from depreciation expense of 5,146, amortization
expense of 2,100, stock based compensation of 112,500, accretion of debt discount of 1,309,703, accretion of original issuance costs
of 146,731, and modification of warrants of 226,929. 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no cash flows
from investing activities. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing was 735,316,
due to proceeds from short term convertible notes of 771,890 and advance from shareholder of 35,000, offset primarily by repayments
of advance from shareholder of 71,574 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 1,311,544 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 due to proceeds from short term convertible notes of 1,272,000, advances from shareholder of 45,000, and fees associated with
the filing of the Company s Form S-1 of 5,456. 

Financing 
We expect that our current working capital position, together with our expected future cash flows from operations will be
insufficient to fund our operations in the ordinary course of business, anticipated capital expenditures, debt payment requirements
and other contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months. As stated above, management intends to raise additional funds
by way of a private offering, public offering, or an asset sale transaction, however there can be no assurance that we will be
successful in completing such transactions. 

We
have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights or
technologies or any other material capital expenditures. However, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of and/or investments in
products, technologies, capital equipment or improvements or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions and/or
investments in the future. Accordingly, we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any such acquisitions
and/or investments. We may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Due to the ongoing global
economic crisis, we believe it may be difficult to obtain additional financing if needed. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing,
it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders,
in the case of equity financing.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we have not entered into any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement with an entity unconsolidated
under which it has: 

a
 retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to the unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit; 

liquidity
 or market risk support to such entity for such assets; 

an
 obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument; or 

an
 obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by, and
 material to us, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to or engages in leasing, hedging,
 or research and development services with us. 

Inflation 

We
do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information
under this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-l5(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information
that would be required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period
specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report (September 30, 2024), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon
that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to enable us to accurately record, process, summarize
and report certain information required to be included in the Company s periodic SEC filings within the required time periods,
and to accumulate and communicate to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-l5(f) of the Securities Exchange Act). Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO (2013). Based on that assessment, management believes that, as of September
30, 2024, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective based on the COSO criteria, due to the following
material weaknesses listed below. 

42 

The
specific material weaknesses identified by the company s management as of end of the period covered by this report include the
following: 

we
 have not performed a risk assessment and mapped our processes to control objectives; 

we
 have not implemented comprehensive entity-level internal controls; 

we
 have not implemented adequate system and manual controls; and 

we
 do not have sufficient segregation of duties. As such, the officers approve their own related business expense reimbursements 

Despite
the material weaknesses reported above, our management believes that our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this
report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented
and that this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by
this report. 

This
report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Commission
that permit us to provide only management s report in this report. 

Management s
Remediation Plan 

The
weaknesses and their related risks are not uncommon in a company of our size because of the limitations in the size and number of staff.
Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties has not always been possible and may not be economically feasible. 

However,
we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design
of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able
to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes in the
current fiscal year as resources allow: 

(i) 
 Appoint
 additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and implement modifications to our financial controls
 to address such inadequacies; 

The
remediation efforts set out herein will be implemented in the 2024 fiscal year. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple
error or mistake. 

Management
believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ending September 30, 2024 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
