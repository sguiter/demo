If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the initial stockholders (as defined below) have agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined below in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. In addition, the initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination.

 or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. The holders of the Founder Shares (as defined below) have agreed not to propose an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the extended deadline of March 28, 2025 (the Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and its board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. The initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the initial stockholders acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.

In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (except for the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement (a Target ), reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or Target that executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

As of September 30, 2024, there were amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans.

In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations, the Company is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the specified period. If a Business Combination is not consummated by March 28, 2025, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. The Company s evaluation of its working capital, along with, the liquidity condition and date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern one year from the date that these financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The Company has identified the United States as its only major tax jurisdiction. The Company is subject to income taxation by major taxing authorities since inception. These examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. While ASC 740 identifies usage of an effective annual tax rate for purposes of an interim provision, it does allow for estimating individual elements in the current period if they are significant, unusual or infrequent. Computing the effective tax rate for the Company is complicated due to the potential impact of the timing of any Business Combination expenses and the actual interest income that will be recognized during the year. The Company has taken a position as to the calculation of income tax expense in a current period based on ASC 740-270-25-3 which states, If an entity is unable to estimate a part of its ordinary income (or loss) or the related tax (benefit) but is otherwise able to make a reasonable estimate, the tax (or benefit) applicable to the item that cannot be estimated shall be reported in the interim period in which the item is reported. The Company believes its calculation to be a reliable estimate and allows it to properly take into account the usual elements that can impact its annualized book income and its impact on the effective tax rate.

Holders of 7,391,973 shares of RFAC Class A Common Stock exercised their right to redeem at a per share redemption price of approximately 10.29. On April 3, 2023, a total of 76,054,240 in redemption payments were made in connection therewith. Following the redemption, RFAC had a total of 4,108,027 shares of RFAC Class A Common Stock outstanding and 42,266,506 in the Trust Account. Following the redemption, RFAC recorded 760,542 of excise tax expense and excise tax payable related to the redemption. On December 20, 2023, a special meeting was held where RFAC Stockholders approved a proposal to amend the RFAC Charter to give RFAC the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from December 28, 2023, to September 28, 2024. In connection therewith the stockholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights. Holders of 1,363,378 shares of RFAC Class A Common Stock exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately 10.72. On December 22, 2023, a total of 14,619,421 in redemption payments were made in connection with the redemption. On December 27, 2023, RFAC deposited into the Trust Account 225,000, which amount was provided by the Sponsor, and extended the deadline to complete the business combination from December 28, 2023 to March 28, 2024. On each of March 25, 2024, April 25, 2024, May 24, 2024, June 25, 2024, July 24, 2024, and August 23, 2024, RFAC deposited into the Trust Account 75,000, which amount was provided by the GCL, and extended the deadline to complete the business combination to August 28, 2024. On September 23, 2024, a special meeting was held where the Company s stockholders of record approved a proposal to amend the Company s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to give the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from September 28, 2024 to March 28, 2025, composed of six monthly extensions after September 28, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Account for each of the six monthly extensions, 0.03 for each share of Class A Common Stock not redeemed in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal. The Company s stockholders were also provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights. Stockholders properly elected to redeem an aggregate of 1,170,280 Class A common stock at a redemption price of approximately 11.23 per share. On September 25, 2024, a total of 13,136,586 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 4,649,369 shares of Class A common stock outstanding. Following the redemption, RFAC had a total of 1,574,369 shares of RFAC Class A Common Stock subject to possible redemption and 17,693,877 in the Trust Account. As a result of the redemptions, RFAC now has less liquidity and fewer round-lot holders of RFAC Public Shares, which may make it more difficult for PubCo to meet all of the Nasdaq listing requirements. Since it is a condition to closing to receive the approval for listing by Nasdaq or the NYSE of the shares of PubCo to be issued in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the reduced public float may make it more difficult for RFAC to meet all of the Nasdaq listing requirements, and to consummate the Business Combination.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, RFAC had 17,693,877 and 29,718,024 cash held in the Trust Account, respectively. RFAC intends to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account to complete the Business Combination. To the extent that its shares or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete the Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the post-Business Combination entity, make other acquisitions and pursue RFAC s growth strategies. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, RFAC had cash of 18,452 and 188,235 held outside of the Trust Account, respectively and had a working capital deficit of 6,658,098. RFAC intends to use the funds held outside of the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, properties, or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representative or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete the Business Combination. In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of RFAC s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan RFAC working capital loans. If RFAC completes the Business Combination, RFAC would repay such loaned amounts. If the Business Combination does not close, RFAC may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from its Trust Account would be used for such repayment. In connection with RFAC s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. RFAC has until March 28, 2025 Revised Extension Deadline ), to consummate a business combination. It is uncertain that RFAC will be able to consummate a business combination by the specified period. If a business combination is not consummated by the Revised Extension Deadline, and RFAC decides not to further extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. The liquidity condition and date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about RFAC s ability to continue as a going concern one year from the date that its financial statements are issued. RFAC s financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should RFAC be unable to continue as a going concern. The following table presents information about the RFAC s cash flow activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023: 

For the Nine Months For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash Flows from Operating Activities: (762,543) (1,252,878) Cash Flows from Investing Activities: 13,184,721 75,972,675 Cash Flows from Financing Activities: (12,591,961) (74,735,490) Operating Activities RFAC used cash for operating activities primarily for operating purposes related to administration of RFAC s activities. Investing Activities The cash provided by investing was due to withdrawals from the trust account for redemption payments. Financing Activities RFAC s cash used in financing activities was due to redemption payments made in August 2024.

 Due to Sponsor The Sponsor has paid expenses on behalf of RFAC, the amount is not interest bearing and due on demand by the Sponsor. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total amount due to Sponsor was 1,504,559 and 1,392,629, respectively. In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of RFAC s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan RFAC working capital loans. If RFAC completes a business combination, RFAC would repay such loaned amounts. If a business combination does not close, RFAC may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from its Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Contractual Obligations Administrative Services Agreement Commencing on the date of the IPO and until completion of RFAC s business combination or liquidation, RFAC will make a payment of a monthly fee of 10,000 to the Sponsor for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support provided to RFAC. Upon completion of a business combination or RFAC s liquidation, RFAC will cease paying these monthly fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, RFAC recognized 90,000 in connection with such services, respectively. Registration and Stockholder Rights The holders of the Sponsor Founder Shares, RFAC Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of the IPO, requiring RFAC to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Sponsor Founder Shares, only after conversion to RFAC Class A Common Stock). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that RFAC register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a business combination and rights to require RFAC to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. RFAC will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement The underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of 2.00 of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or 2,300,000. On March 30, 2022, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 1,500,000 over-allotment Units, generating an aggregate of gross proceeds of 15,000,000. Business Combination Marketing Agreement On March 23, 2022, RFAC engaged EBC as an advisor in connection with a business combination to assist RFAC in holding meetings with its stockholders to discuss the potential business combination and the target business attributes, introduce RFAC to potential investors that are interested in purchasing RFAC s securities in connection with a business combination, assist RFAC with its press releases and public filings in connection with a business combination. RFAC will pay EBC a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a business combination in an amount equal to 3.5 of the gross proceeds of IPO. Additionally, RFAC will pay EBC a cash fee equal to 1.0 of the total consideration payable in the proposed business combination if it introduces RFAC to the target business with which RFAC completes a business combination; provided that the foregoing fee will not be paid prior to the date that is 90 days from the effective date of the IPO, unless the FINRA determines that such payment would not be deemed underwriters compensation in connection with the IPO pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110.

 EBC Founder Shares On April 12, 2021, RFAC issued to EBC and or designees an aggregate of 200,000 shares of RFAC Class A Common Stock at a price of 0.0001 per share for a total consideration of 20. RFAC accounts for the fair value of the EBC Founder Shares over consideration paid as offering cost of the IPO, with a corresponding credit to stockholder s equity. RFAC estimated the fair value of the EBC Founder Shares to be 519,415 and is recorded as an offering cost with a corresponding increase in stockholder s equity. RFAC established the initial fair value of the EBC Founder Shares on April 12, 2021, using a probability weighted model for the EBC Founder Shares. The EBC Founder Shares are classified as Level 3 at the measurement date due to the use of unobservable inputs including the probability of a business combination, the probability of the IPO, and other risk factors. EBC (and/or its designees) has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such shares without RFAC s prior written consent until the completion of the Business Combination. In addition, EBC (and/or its designees) has agreed (i) to waive its redemption rights with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of the Business Combination and (ii) to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if RFAC fails to complete the Business Combination by September 28, 2024. The shares have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a lock-up for a period of 180 days immediately following the date of the effectiveness of the registration statement pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(g)(1). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(g)(1), these securities will not be the subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative, put or call transaction that would result in the economic disposition of the securities by any person for a period of 180 days immediately following the effective date of the registration statement, nor may they be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a period of 180 days immediately following the effective date of the registration statement except to any underwriter and selected dealer that participated in RFAC s IPO and their bona fide officers or partners. Critical Accounting Estimates This management s discussion and analysis of RFAC s financial condition and results of operations is based on RFAC s financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of RFAC s financial statements requires RFAC to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in RFAC s financial statements. On an ongoing basis, RFAC evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. RFAC bases its estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that RFAC believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. RFAC is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09 requires additional quantitative and qualitative income tax disclosures to enable financial statements users to better assess how an entity s operations and related tax risks and tax planning and operational opportunities affect its tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. For public business entities, ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, which will be fiscal 2025 for us. We expect the adoption to result in disclosure changes only.

 Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on RFAC s financial statements. JOBS Act The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. RFAC qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and is allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. RFAC is electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, RFAC may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, RFAC s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. Additionally, RFAC is in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, RFAC chooses to rely on such exemptions RFAC may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an independent registered public accounting firm s attestation report on RFAC s system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the independent registered public accounting firm s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of RFAC s IPO or until RFAC is no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, RFAC did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants held in the Trust Account were initially invested in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, RFAC believes there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. However, if the interest rates of U.S. Treasury obligations become negative, RFAC may have less interest income available to us for payment of taxes, and a decline in the value of the assets held in the Trust Account could reduce the principal below the amount initially deposited in the Trust Account. In February of 2023, RFAC s trust balance was moved to an interest-bearing bank deposit account due to receiving a slightly higher interest rate from Citibank. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, RFAC had 17,693,877 and 29,718,024 in the trust account, respectively. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such 

 28 

Table of Contents 
 information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on their evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with lack of controls to assure the accuracy and completeness of accrued expenses and classification and presentation of expense reimbursement accounting and excise taxes payable. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness relates to the lack of segregation of duties in financial reporting, as our financial reporting and all accounting functions are performed by an external consultant with no oversight by a professional with accounting expertise. We expect to be materially dependent upon a third party to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future. Management s Quarterly Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not include a report of management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
