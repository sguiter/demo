 Accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024 included unbilled accounts receivable of million. We expect to invoice and collect all unbilled accounts receivable within twelve months. 
 We record deferred revenue when we have entered into a contract with a customer and cash payments are received or due prior to transfer of control or satisfaction of the related performance obligation. 
 Our performance obligations are generally satisfied within twelve months of the initial contract date. The deferred revenue balances related to performance obligations that will be satisfied after twelve months were million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023. These balances are included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Revenue recognized in the period from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods was not material for the periods presented.

 Upfront and Incentive payments 
 In the fourth quarter of 2018, we made an initial payment for an upfront fee of million through the issuance of million shares of our common stock. We recorded a million charge in our consolidated statements of operations during 2018 relating to the issuance of this common stock because this milestone payment did not meet the capitalization criteria. The value of the charge was based on our closing stock price of per share on December 28, 2018, the date on which we obtained the necessary regulatory approvals and represents the date the performance-based awards were issued. In 2019, we made a cash incentive payment of million due to the completion of certain development obligations and we recorded these payments as research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 Contingent milestones 
 In the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined the achievement of the regulatory approval milestone to be probable and recorded an million research and development charge in our consolidated statements of operations. This charge is associated with in-process research and development obtained in an asset acquisition prior to regulatory approval and therefore does not have an alternative future use. 
 In the first quarter of 2022, we received regulatory approval and issued million shares of our common stock in connection with our achievement of the related milestone. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, we received approval from the Food and Drug Administration and determined the achievement of the sales-based milestones to be probable. As such, we capitalized the full value of the sales-based milestones, million, as an intangible asset. The sales-based milestones are contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue targets. The value of the sales-based milestones is based on: 1) million shares of our common stock, as agreed upon in November 2018 and 2) our closing stock price on December 28, 2018 of per share. December 28, 2018 is the date on which we obtained the necessary regulatory approvals and represents the date the performance-based awards were issued. The intangible asset will be amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life of months through March 2028. The related amortization expense is recognized in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations.

 million and million, respectively. The resulting impact on our consolidated financial statements from currency hedging activities was not significant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 Our foreign currency exposures vary but are primarily concentrated in the Australian Dollar, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, and the Malaysian Ringgit. We monitor the costs and the impact of foreign currency risks upon our financial results as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes or for activities other than risk management. We do not require and are not required to pledge collateral for these financial instruments and we do not carry any master netting arrangements to mitigate the credit risk. 
 
 million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023. We include the carrying values of these investments in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. It is impracticable for us to estimate the fair value of these investments on a recurring basis due to the fact that these entities are privately held and limited information is available. We monitor the information that becomes available from time to time and adjust the carrying values of these investments if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that have a significant effect on the fair values. 
 There were significant impairment losses on assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

 As of September 30, 2024, the estimated market values of our short-term debt securities with contractual maturities up to months and up to months were billion and million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the estimated market value of our short-term debt securities with contractual maturities up to months was billion. Gross realized gains and losses on sales of our short-term debt securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were not significant. 
 We periodically review our portfolio of debt securities to determine if any investment is impaired due to credit loss or other potential valuation concerns. For debt securities where the fair value of the investment is less than the amortized cost basis, we have assessed at the individual security level for various quantitative factors including, but not limited to, the nature of the investments, changes in credit ratings, interest rate fluctuations, industry analyst reports, and the severity of impairment. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities at September 30, 2024 were primarily due to changes in interest rates, including market credit spreads, and not due to increased credit risks associated with specific securities. Accordingly, we have not recorded an allowance for credit losses. We do not intend to sell these investments and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity.

 We use the if-converted method for assumed conversion of our senior convertible notes to compute the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for diluted earnings per share. 
 No principal payments are due on any of our senior convertible notes prior to maturity. Other than restrictions relating to certain fundamental changes and consolidations, mergers or asset sales and customary anti-dilution adjustments, the indentures relating to our senior convertible notes include customary terms and covenants, including certain events of default after which the senior convertible notes may be due and payable immediately. 
 2023 Note Hedge 
 In connection with the offering of the 2023 Notes, in November 2018 we entered into convertible note hedge transactions, or the 2023 Note Hedge, with of the initial purchasers of the 2023 Notes, which we refer to as the 2023 Counterparties, entitling us to purchase up to million shares of our common stock. The 2023 Note Hedge expired on December 1, 2023. See below for a description of conversion activity related to the 2023 Notes and shares received as the result of exercising the remaining portion of the 2023 Note Hedge in 2023. 
 2023 Warrants 
 In November 2018, we also sold warrants, or the 2023 Warrants, to the 2023 Counterparties to acquire up to million shares of our common stock. The 2023 Warrants required net share settlement and a pro-rated number of warrants expired on each of the scheduled trading days following March 1, 2024. We received million in cash proceeds from the sale of the 2023 Warrants, which we recorded in additional paid-in capital during 2018. The 2023 Warrants could have had a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock during a given measurement period exceeded the strike price of the 2023 Warrants. The strike price of the 2023 Warrants was initially per share, subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the warrant agreements.

 On February 13, 2024, we entered into a warrant termination agreement with one of the 2023 Counterparties to terminate outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock. In consideration of the termination of these warrants, we delivered million shares of our common stock to the holder.

Our actual effective tax rate of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to income tax expense from normal, recurring operations, partially offset by excess tax benefits recognized for share-based compensation for employees, net of disallowed executive compensation, and the Verily milestone payment. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has a framework to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15 for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds (referred to as Pillar 2), with certain aspects of Pillar 2 effective January 1, 2024 and other aspects effective January 1, 2025. While it is uncertain whether the United States will enact legislation to adopt Pillar 2, certain countries in which we operate have adopted legislation, and other countries in which we operate are in the process of introducing legislation to implement Pillar 2. We have assessed the impact of Pillar 2 on our financial statements and the impact is immaterial. 
 In June 2024, the State of California enacted S.B. 167, which suspends the use of net operating losses NOLs for the tax period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026 for net business income of 1.0 million or more, as well as limits the utilization of research and development tax credits to 5.0 million each year. The State of California also passed S.B. 175 to provide for a potential early sunset of NOLs in either 2025 or 2026 if necessary. We have analyzed the effect of both these laws on our financial statements. We are estimating million utilization of our California research and development tax credits for tax year ending December 31, 2024, resulting in a corresponding valuation allowance release of the same amount.

 Overview 
 Who We Are We are a medical device company primarily focused on the design, development and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring, or CGM, systems for the management of diabetes and metabolic health by patients, caregivers, and clinicians around the world. 
 We received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and commercialized our first product in 2006. We launched our latest generation system, the Dexcom G6 integrated Continuous Glucose Monitoring System, or G6, in 2018, and we launched the Dexcom G7 , or G7, in 2023. In August 2024, we launched Stelo, our new biosensor designed for adults with prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin, as the first over-the-counter glucose biosensor in the U.S. 
 Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms we, us, our, the company, or Dexcom refer to DexCom, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Global Presence We have built a direct sales organization in North America and certain international markets to call on health care professionals, such as endocrinologists, physicians and diabetes educators, who can educate and influence patient adoption of continuous glucose monitoring. To complement our direct sales efforts, we have entered into distribution arrangements in North America and several international markets that allow distributors to sell our products. 
 Future Developments Product Development: We plan to develop future generations of technologies that are focused on improved performance and convenience and that will enable intelligent insulin administration. Over the longer term, we plan to continue to develop and improve networked platforms with open architecture, connectivity and transmitters capable of communicating with other devices. We also intend to expand our efforts to accumulate CGM patient data and metrics and apply predictive modeling and machine learning to generate interactive CGM insights that can inform patient behavior. 
 Partnerships: We also continue to pursue and support development partnerships with insulin pump companies and companies or institutions developing insulin delivery systems, including automated insulin delivery systems. 
 New Opportunities: We are also exploring how to extend our offerings to other opportunities, including for people with Type 2 diabetes that are non-insulin using, people with pre-diabetes, people who are obese, people who are pregnant, and people in the hospital setting. Eventually, we may apply our technological expertise to products beyond glucose monitoring.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider them to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. There were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Overview of Financial Results The most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, and operating cash flow. 
 Key Highlights for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 include the following: 
 Revenue Gross Profit Operating Income Net Income Operating Cash Flow 994.2 million 593.8 million 152.0 million 134.6 million 199.5 million up 2 from the same period in 2023

 Revenue 
 We generate our revenue from the sale of disposable sensors and our reusable transmitter and receiver, collectively referred to as Reusable Hardware. We expect that the revenue we generate from the sales of our products will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We typically experience seasonality, with lower sales in the first quarter of each year compared to the immediately preceding fourth quarter. This seasonal sales pattern relates to U.S. annual insurance deductible resets and unfunded flexible spending accounts. 
 Cost of sales 
 Cost of sales includes direct labor and materials costs related to each product sold or produced, including assembly, test labor and scrap, as well as factory overhead supporting our manufacturing operations. Factory overhead includes facilities, material procurement and control, manufacturing engineering, quality assurance, supervision and management. These costs are primarily salary, fringe benefits, share-based compensation, facility expense, supplies and purchased services. All of our manufacturing costs are included in cost of sales. In addition, amortization of certain licensing related intangibles are also included in cost of sales. 
 Research and development 
 Our research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering and research expenses related to our sensing technology, clinical trials, regulatory expenses, quality assurance programs, employee compensation, and business process outsourcers. 
 Selling, general and administrative 
 Our selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation for our executive, financial, sales, marketing, information technology and administrative functions. Other significant expenses include commissions, marketing and advertising, IT software license costs, insurance, professional fees for our outside legal counsel and independent auditors, litigation expenses, patent application expenses and consulting expenses.

 Revenue The revenue increase was primarily driven by increased sales volume of our disposable sensors due to the continued growth of our worldwide customer base. We added approximately 600,000 net users to our worldwide customer base in 2023. The increase in revenue was offset by pricing headwinds due to greater rebate eligibility and channel mix. 
 
 Disposable sensor and other revenue comprised approximately 96 of total revenue and Reusable Hardware revenue comprised approximately 4 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Disposable sensor and other revenue comprised approximately 90 of total revenue and Reusable Hardware revenue comprised approximately 10 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of sales Gross profit Cost of sales and gross profit increased primarily due to an increase in sales volume driven by the addition of approximately 600,000 net users to our worldwide customer base in 2023. 
 
 The decrease in gross profit margin percentage in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by product and channel mix changes and a 24.6 million non-cash inventory build charge.

 Research and development expense Research and development expense increased primarily due to 4.5 million in clinical trials, supplies and other support costs and 2.7 million in software and data costs, offset by a 2.8 million decrease in compensation and related costs. 
 
 We continue to believe that focused investments in research and development are critical to our future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to our core business strategy. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to 13.6 million in advertising and marketing costs and 5.4 million in software and data costs, offset by a 7.1 million decrease in compensation and related costs. 
 Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, decreased primarily due to a 9.5 million decrease in interest and dividend income on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities portfolio. The decrease in interest income was related to a change in market interest rates, as well as a decrease in the average invested balances compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Income tax expense The income tax expense recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to income tax expense from normal, recurring operations and discrete impacts of certain foreign tax return filings. 
 The income tax expense recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to income tax expense from normal, recurring operations, discrete income tax expense related to an intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property, and decrease in the state tax rate applied to beginning of year deferred tax assets. 
 The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily attributable to impacts of the prior year tax restructuring.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview, Capital Resources, and Capital Requirements 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, proceeds from our senior convertible notes issuances, and access to our Credit Facility. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses, and debt service costs. 
 We expect that cash provided by our operations may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, working capital requirements and capital deployment decisions. We have historically invested our cash primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated, investment grade, highly liquid obligations of U.S. government agencies, commercial paper, corporate debt, and money market funds. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity and other market risks. The general condition of the financial markets and the economy may increase those risks and may affect the value and liquidity of investments and restrict our ability to access the capital markets. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to: 
 The evolution of the international expansion of our business and the revenue generated by sales of our approved products and any future products; 
 Our ability to efficiently scale our operations to meet demand for our current and any future products; The success of our research and development efforts; The expenses we incur in manufacturing, developing, selling and marketing our products; The costs, timing and risks of delays of additional regulatory approvals; The costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; The quality levels of our products and services; The emergence of competing or complementary technological developments; The terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish; and The third-party reimbursement of our products for our customers; The rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other development activities; The acquisition of businesses, products and technologies and our ability to integrate and manage any acquired businesses, products and technologies. 
 We expect that existing cash and short-term investments and cash flows from our future operations will generally be sufficient to fund our ongoing core business. As current borrowing sources become due, we may be required to access the capital markets for additional funding. As we assess inorganic growth strategies, we may need to supplement our internally generated cash flow with outside sources. In the event that we are required to access the debt market, we believe that we will be able to secure reasonable borrowing rates. As part of our liquidity strategy, we will continue to monitor our current level of earnings and cash flow generation as well as our ability to access the market in light of those earning levels. 
 A substantial portion of our operations are located in the United States, and the majority of our sales since inception have been made in U.S. dollars. We will be exposed to additional foreign currency exchange risk related to our international operations as we expand our manufacturing internationally and as our business continues to increase in international markets. See Foreign Currency Exchange Risk in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, for more information.

 Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities totaled 2.49 billion as of September 30, 2024. None of those funds were restricted and 2.30 billion (approximately 92 of those funds were located in the United States. 
 Cash flows from Operations 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had positive cash flows of 688.1 million from operating activities. We anticipate that we will continue to generate positive cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. 
 Senior Convertible Notes 
 We received net proceeds of 1.19 billion in May 2020 from the 2025 Notes offering, and net proceeds of 1.23 billion in May 2023 from the 2028 Notes offering. We used 282.6 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2025 Notes to repurchase a portion of our senior convertible notes due in 2022. We used 289.9 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2028 Notes to purchase capped call transactions and repurchase shares of our common stock in May 2023. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the 2025 Notes offering and 2028 Notes offering for general corporate purposes and capital expenditures, including working capital needs. We may also use the net proceeds to expand our current business through in-licensing or acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses, products or technologies; however, we do not have any significant commitments with respect to any such acquisitions or investments at this time. 
 In connection with the 2028 Notes offering, we purchased the 2028 Capped Calls. See Note 5 Debt to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information about our senior convertible notes and the 2028 Capped Calls. 
 Revolving Credit Agreement 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings, 7.6 million in outstanding letters of credit, and a total available balance of 192.4 million under the Amended Credit Agreement. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the Credit Facility. We currently believe that the Credit Facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it. Revolving loans will be available for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. See Note 5 Debt to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the Amended Credit Agreement. 
 Short-term Liquidity Requirements 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of regular operating costs, interest payments related to our senior convertible notes, capital expenditures for the development of our manufacturing facilities and office spaces, and short-term material cash requirements as described below. As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital ratio of 2.46 and a quick ratio of 2.01, which indicates that our current assets are more than enough to cover our short-term liabilities. We expect to have significant capital expenditures for the next year to scale-up capacity in Mesa, Arizona and drive our strategic initiatives of building out our manufacturing facilities and/or equipment in Malaysia and Ireland. 
 We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, projected cash contributions from our commercial operations, and borrowings under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated seasonal working capital needs, all capital expenditure requirements, material cash requirements as described below, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. We may use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock or for other strategic initiatives that strengthen our foundation for long-term growth. 
 Long-term Liquidity Requirements 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of interest and principal payments related to our senior convertible notes, capital expenditures for the development of our manufacturing facilities and office spaces, and long-term material cash requirements as described below. As of September 30, 2024, we had a debt-to-assets ratio of 0.38, which indicates that our total assets are more than enough to cover our short-term and long-term debts. As demand grows for our products, we will continue to expand global operations to meet demand through investments in manufacturing and operations. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements from our main sources of

 liquidity as described above to support our future operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations beyond the next 12 months. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have outstanding senior convertible notes that will mature in November 2025 and May 2028. However, the outstanding principal of our senior convertible notes could be converted into cash and/or shares of our common stock prior to maturity once certain conditions are met. See Note 5 Debt Senior Convertible Notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information on conversion rights prior to maturity. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into a variety of purchase arrangements including but not limited to, purchase arrangements related to capital expenditures, components used in manufacturing, and research and development activities. See Contractual Obligations below for more information. 
 Our obligations under the 2025 Notes and 2028 Notes include both principal and interest payments. Although the 2025 Notes and 2028 Notes mature in November 2025 and May 2028, respectively, they may be converted into cash and/or shares of our common stock prior to maturity if certain conditions are met. Any conversion prior to maturity may result in repayment of the principal amounts due under the Notes sooner than the scheduled repayment. 
 As market conditions warrant, we may, from time to time, repurchase our outstanding debt securities or shares of our common stock, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, by exchange transaction or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time. The amounts involved and total consideration paid may be material. See Note 8 Stockholder s Equity Share Repurchase Program and Treasury Shares to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information about our 2024 Share Repurchase Program. 
 See Note 5 Debt to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information about the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, our senior convertible notes, and the 2028 Capped Calls. 
 We are party to various leasing arrangements, primarily for office, manufacturing and warehouse space that expire at various times through December 2030, excluding any renewal options. We also have land leases in Penang, Malaysia that expire in 2082 and Athenry, Ireland that expire in 3023 for our international manufacturing facilities. We anticipate incurring significant expenditures related to our Malaysia manufacturing facility and equipment over the next year and the build-out of the Ireland manufacturing facility and equipment over the next five years. See Note 6 Leases and Other Commitments Leases to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for more information about our leases.

 ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Regulations under the Exchange Act require public companies to maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and timely communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of such date. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls 
 It should be noted that any system of controls, including ours, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. The design of any control system is based, in part, upon the benefits of the control system relative to its costs. Control systems can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. In addition, over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, we cannot guarantee that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are subject to various claims, complaints and legal actions that arise from time to time in the normal course of business, including commercial insurance, product liability, intellectual property and employment related matters. In addition, from time to time we may bring claims or initiate lawsuits against various third parties with respect to matters arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including commercial and employment related matters. 
 Litigation with Abbott 
 Since June 2021, we and certain Abbott Diabetes Care, Inc. Abbott entities have served patent infringement complaints against each other in multiple jurisdictions against certain continuous glucose monitoring products of each company. 
 In June 2021, we initiated patent infringement litigation against Abbott in the United States (U.S.D.C., Western District of Texas) and Germany (National Court N.C. in Mannheim). In May 2023, we filed additional patent infringement actions in Germany (N.C. in Munich). In July and August 2023, we initiated patent infringement litigation in the United Patent Court UPC (Paris Munich) and in Spain (Commercial Courts of Barcelona). 
 In October and November 2023, we initiated patent infringement litigation in Germany (N.C. in Munich) and in the UPC (Paris Munich). In January 2024, we initiated patent infringement litigation in Germany (N.C. in Hamburg). 
 In July 2024, after hearings in May and June in the Paris and Munich divisions of the UPC, each division issued a decision revoking our patents asserted against Abbott. In late 2024 and early 2025, hearings in the Paris, Munich and Stockholm divisions of the UPC are scheduled wherein Dexcom asserts two patents against Abbott and Abbott asserts three patents against Dexcom. 
 In July 2021, one day after we initiated litigation in the U.S.D.C., Western District of Texas, Abbott initiated patent infringement litigation against Dexcom in the United States (U.S.D.C., Delaware D1 )). Shortly thereafter, Abbott filed additional patent infringement litigation actions in the United Kingdom (Business and Property Courts of England and Wales) and Germany (N.C. in Mannheim and Dusseldorf). 
 In response to the lawsuits initiated by Abbott in the United Kingdom, Dexcom also filed patent infringement counterclaims in the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales. Three trials on liability have already been conducted in the United Kingdom. On October 18, 2023 and June 28, 2024, judgment was handed down in favor of Dexcom, finding the Abbott patents to be invalid and not infringed. On January 15, 2024, judgment was handed down invalidating both Abbott and Dexcom s patents. 
 In December 2021, Abbott filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Dexcom in the United States (U.S.D.C., District of Delaware) alleging that Dexcom breached the parties' Settlement and License Agreement dated July 2, 2014 SLA ). The U.S.D.C., District of Delaware consolidated Abbott s breach of contract lawsuit with Dexcom s patent infringement lawsuit which had been transferred from the U.S.D.C., Western District of Texas D3 ). Dexcom asserted counterclaims that Abbott also breached the SLA. A jury trial on Abbott s breach of contract claims commenced on July 10, 2023. On July 14, 2023, the jury verdict determined that Abbott was not licensed to thirteen claims of certain Dexcom patents and that Abbott was licensed to five claims. In April 2022, Abbott initiated the inter partes review IPR process on the asserted claims of Dexcom s patents in D3. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the PTO denied institution of one of Dexcom s patents and instituted IPR on the other four. Ultimately, in November 2023, the PTO issued its Final Written Decision, upholding claims of two Dexcom patents to be patentable, which cover factory calibration and certain alarms and alerts, and two to be unpatentable, which cover certain sensor code and sensor configurations. We will continue to enforce the remaining claims of the patents asserted in Delaware at a trial set for January 11, 2027. 
 In February 2023, Abbott filed patent infringement litigation against us in Germany (N.C. in Hamburg and Munich). In March 2023, Abbott filed a patent infringement litigation in the United States (U.S.D.C., Delaware D4 )) and we filed counterclaims for patent infringement in that action in June 2023. The D4 Court recently set a February 15, 2027 trial date for Abbott s offensive case and a March 8, 2027 trial date for Dexcom s offensive case. In June 2023, Abbott filed patent infringement litigation actions in the United Kingdom (Business and Property Courts of England and Wales). In response to the lawsuits initiated by Abbott in the United Kingdom, Dexcom also filed patent infringement counterclaims in that jurisdiction. Two trials are set to occur in the United Kingdom in late 2024 and early 2025, with two Dexcom patents asserted and one Abbott patent asserted.

Table of Contents 

 Abbott s patent infringement trial, D1 , against Dexcom commenced in the U.S.D.C., District of Delaware in March 2024. In the lead up to trial, the U.S.D.C., District of Delaware invalidated one of Abbott s patents on factory calibration and Abbott dropped four other patents from the litigation. The claims litigated were isolated to the inserter mechanism and the wearable seal and mount of Dexcom s G6. On March 22, 2024, a jury returned a mixed verdict. The jury found that Dexcom infringes one patent, that Dexcom did not infringe a second patent, and that Dexcom also did not infringe a third patent, which the jury also found invalid. The jury found that any infringement was not willful. It could not reach unanimity as to a fourth patent. No determination of damages was made or awarded. Dexcom has challenged the sole finding of infringement and continues to defend itself vigorously. 
 Commencing in January 2024, patent infringement hearings between Abbott and Dexcom were scheduled to take place in Germany wherein each sought damages and injunctive relief against the other. All but one of Abbott s offensive hearings were either stayed or cancelled entirely due to parallel invalidity proceedings and nullity decisions. After a February 28, 2024 hearing in Munich wherein Abbott asserted patent infringement claims against Dexcom, Dexcom received a favorable non-infringement decision. On July 24, 2024, Dexcom received a decision from the Munich court related to the July 3, 2024 hearing, staying our offensive infringement proceedings pending the outcome of an opposition proceeding. On July 31, 2024, Dexcom received a decision from the Munich courts related to hearings in April 2024, dismissing our claims for infringement. Dexcom and Abbott each await a decision from the Munich court on infringement proceedings which took place in September 2024. 
 Due to uncertainty surrounding patent litigation procedures initiated by Dexcom and Abbott throughout multiple jurisdictions, we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of any of the litigation matters at this time. We intend to protect our intellectual property and defend against Abbott s claims vigorously in all of these actions. 
 Securities Class Action Litigation 
 On August 21, 2024, a putative class action complaint was filed against us and certain of our executive officers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (captioned Alonzo v. DexCom, Inc., Case No. 24-cv-1485) alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act for allegedly making false and misleading statements between January 8, 2024 and July 25, 2024 with respect to our expected revenue for fiscal 2024 and ability to capitalize on our growth potential. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages and attorney s fees and costs. On October 3, 2024, the court granted the parties joint motion to defer our deadline to respond to the complaint until after appointment of lead plaintiff. 
 On October 8, 2024, a second, substantially similar, putative class action complaint was filed against us and certain of our officers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (captioned Oakland County Employees Retirement System v. DexCom, Inc., Case No. 24-cv-1804), alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act for allegedly making false and misleading statements between April 28, 2023 and July 25, 2024. On October 9, 2024, a third, substantially similar, putative class action complaint was filed against us and certain of our officers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (captioned Carnes v. DexCom, Inc., Case No. 24-cv-1809). 
 Derivative Actions 
 On September 13, 2024, a putative stockholder filed a derivative lawsuit against us and certain of our current and former executive officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (captioned Silva v. Sayer, et al., Case No. 24-cv-1645). On October 7, 2024, another putative stockholder filed a second derivative lawsuit against us and certain of our current and former executive officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (captioned Malone v. Sayer, et al., Case No. 24-cv-1799). The derivative complaints allege factual allegations largely tracking allegations made in the Securities Class Action Litigation and seek, among other things, damages and restitution to be paid to the Company by the individual defendants, punitive damages, and attorney s fees and costs. On October 16, 2024, the parties filed a joint motion to consolidate the two derivative actions and stay the consolidated action until (i) the dismissal of the Securities Class Action, with prejudice, and exhaustion of all appeals related thereto; or (ii) the denial of any motion to dismiss the Securities Class Action in whole or in part. 
 We intend to vigorously defend against such claims; however, we cannot be certain of the outcome of our ongoing proceedings and, if determined adversely to us, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 We do not believe we are party to any other currently pending legal proceedings, the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. There can be no assurance that existing or future legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

 ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS 
 There were no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed and included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

 Amendment to Bylaws 
 On and effective as of October 22, 2024, our Board of Directors (the Board approved an amendment and restatement of our bylaws (the Amended and Restated Bylaws ), to, among other things: 
 Revise the notice deadline for the submission of proposals or nominations under our advance notice bylaw to provide that such notices must generally be received no earlier than 120 days and no later than 90 days prior to the anniversary of the prior year s annual meeting; 
 Address the effectiveness of Rule 14a-19 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended i . e ., federal proxy rules regarding the use of universal proxy cards in contested director elections), including by requiring that any nominating stockholder represent and provide evidence that such stockholder is soliciting the holders of shares representing at least 67 of the voting power of the company; 
 Require that a stockholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other stockholders use a proxy card color other than white, which is to be reserved for exclusive use by the Board; and 
 Update the procedural mechanics and disclosure requirements relating to director nominations submitted by stockholders, including by: 
 enhancing the disclosure requirements in connection with director nominations by stockholders to include (i) additional information regarding the stockholder making the director nomination(s), their affiliates and the director nominee(s), and (ii) a requirement that such information is to be updated as of the record date for the applicable meeting; 
 requiring any notice of director nomination be accompanied by written questionnaires required of our directors completed and signed by any proposed director nominee(s); and 
 limiting the number of nominees a stockholder may nominate for election at a meeting to the number of directors to be elected at such meeting. 
 Additional amendments were made to align the Amended and Restated Bylaws more closely with the Delaware General Corporation Law, provide us more flexibility to conduct virtual stockholder meetings and to implement clarifying, conforming, technical or ministerial changes. 
 In light of the change to the notice deadline under our advance notice bylaw described above, stockholders wishing to present nominations for director or proposals for consideration at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders under these provisions of our bylaws must submit their nominations or proposals in writing so that they are delivered to our Chief Legal Officer at our principal executive offices not earlier than January 22, 2025, and not later than February 21, 2025.

 Section 7.2. Waiver of Notice.

Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any waiver of notice.
