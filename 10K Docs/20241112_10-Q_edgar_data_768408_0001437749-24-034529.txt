and working capital of compared to and , respectively, as of March 31, 2024. The Company had a Line of Credit with the Bank that provided for borrowings up to on a revolving basis, however, as part of the covenant waiver at March 31, 2023, the borrowings under this Line of Credit were frozen. On October 13, 2023, the Bank converted this Line of Credit to a term loan in the amount of with an original maturity date of August 30, 2024 the 2023 Loan ). As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company had and , respectively, outstanding on the 2023 Loan, with a maturity date, which was extended to March 31, 2025. See Note 5 ). 
 
 The Company also has a loan facility with a related party that allows the Company to borrow up to on a revolving basis (the Revolver ). At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company had and , respectively, outstanding borrowings on the Revolver, which was included in line of credit related party on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Revolver expires on April 12, 2026 see Notes 5 and 12 ). 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had of debt pursuant to the 2012 Loan (as defined below) payable to the Bank that require the payment of principal and interest monthly through August 2032. Pursuant to the 2012 Loan and the 2023 Loan, the Company is subject to annual financial covenants, customary affirmative and negative covenants and certain subjective acceleration clauses. As of March 31, 2024, the Company s debt service coverage ratio and current ratio fell short of the Bank s annual requirement. On September 12, 2024, the Bank provided the Company with a letter waiving the covenant violations as of March 31, 2024, but noting that the Bank reserves its right to declare a default in the future if any covenants remain out of compliance at applicable measurement dates. 

In April 2019, the Company obtained a loan in the amount of from a related party. The proceeds were used to pay down accounts payable and for general operating capital purposes. On April 12, 2021, December 14, 2022, August 14, 2023, and August 9, 2024, the Company amended this loan (see Notes 5 and 12 ). As of both September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding on the related party note. The loan matures on April 12, 2027. 
 
 The Company continues to experience a loss from operations as the impacts from the macroeconomic environment led to lower sales across the Company's portfolio, therefore, the Company continues to rely on its funding source to provide liquidity. To address the resulting cash flow challenges, the Company continues to monitor cost savings initiatives implemented in fiscal year 2023, including stopping or slowing production of inventory in alignment with current customer demand, maintaining a reduced headcount and compensation, primarily through attrition and furloughs, respectively, and eliminating certain discretionary selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company has also made changes in the sales and marketing team starting with the Chief Commercial Officer and strengthening the sales team, re-positioning the brand(s) and optimizing the Company s marketing efforts to emphasize its competitive strengths. In addition, the Company raised capital by completing a private placement in the third fiscal quarter of 2024. 
 
 Funds generated by operating activities and available cash are the Company s most significant sources of liquidity for working capital requirements, debt service and funding of maintenance levels of capital expenditures. The Company has developed its operating plan to produce a significant portion of its cash flows necessary to meet all financing requirements, with the remaining need for capital raising. Although the Company has a history of either being in compliance with debt covenants, or obtaining the necessary waivers, execution of its operating plan is dependent on many factors, some of which are not within the control of the Company. However, no assurances can be provided that the Company will achieve its operating plan and cash flow projections for the next fiscal years or its projected consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2025. Such estimates are subject to change based on future results and such change could cause future results to vary significantly from expected results. 

If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
 
 Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value. 

Cash, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Customer Deposits - Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, management believes that the carrying amounts approximate fair value. 
 
 Line of Credit, Revolver, Short-Term and Long-Term Debt - The carrying amount of our line of credit, Revolver and short and long-term debt approximates fair value as interest rates applied to the underlying debt are adjusted quarterly to market interest rates, which approximate current interest rates for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. 
 
 customers individually accounted for and of the Company s total net sales, and for the three months ended September 30, 2023, customers individually accounted for and of the Company s total net sales. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, two customers individually accounted for and of the Company s total net sales, and for the six months ended September 30, 2023, customers individually accounted for and of the Company s total net sales. Two customers accounted for and of the Company s accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. 

Customer contract liabilities consist of customer deposits received in advance of fulfilling an order and are shown separately on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized and , respectively, of revenue from deposits that were included in contract liabilities as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized and , respectively, of revenue from deposits that were included in contract liabilities as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s contracts have a duration of one year or less and therefore, the Company has elected the practical expedient of not disclosing revenues allocated to partially unsatisfied performance obligations.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023 - 09, Income Taxes (Topic 740 ): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosure ASU 2023 - 09 ), which enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. Adjustments to the annual disclosure of income taxes include: a tabulate rate reconciliation comprised of eight specific categories; income taxes paid, disaggregated between significant federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions; eliminating requirements to disclose the nature and estimate of reasonably possible changes to unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months or that an estimated range cannot be made; and adds a requirement to disclose income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) and income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated between domestic and foreign. ASU 2023 - 09 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in ASU 2023 - 09 should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2023 - 09 to determine its impact on the Company s disclosures.

The Company recognizes abnormal production costs, including fixed cost variances from normal production capacity, fixed production overhead costs, idle facilities, freight handling costs and spoilage, as an expense in the period incurred, without adjusting overhead absorption rates. Normal production capacity is defined as the production expected to be achieved over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances, taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance. The Company had abnormal production capitalization of and abnormal production costs to cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company had abnormal production capitalization of and abnormal production expense of to cost of sales for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 In fiscal year 2024, cultivation of astaxanthin was completed year-round, however, in fiscal year 2025, cultivation of astaxanthin will be completed in the most productive nine months of the year. The Company calculates total production costs for the year based on normal capacity of production expected to be achieved in a year under normal circumstances. These costs are then allocated into inventory based on the period of production, not including abnormal production costs. Allocating fixed and overhead costs requires management s judgement to determine when production is outside of the normal range of expected variation in production. 
 
 Other non-inventoriable fixed costs of and were expensed to cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other non-inventoriable fixed costs of and were expensed to cost of sales for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Line of Credit and Term Loans 
 
 On June 3, 2016, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with the Bank, after the necessary approvals from the State of Hawaii were received, to secure the lien on the Company s leasehold property in Kona, Hawaii. The Credit Agreement further defined the terms and conditions for the 2012 Loan and allowed for the Line of Credit, which was subsequently converted to the 2023 loan. The Credit Agreement grants the Bank the following security interests in the Company s property: (a) a lien on the Company s leasehold interest in its Kona facility; (b) an assignment of the Company s interest in leases and rents on its Kona facility; and (c) a security interest in all fixtures, furnishings and equipment related to or used by the Company at the Kona facility. Each security interest is further subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement.

 On October 13, 2023, the Bank converted the Line of Credit to the 2023 Loan in the amount of , with no further advances or disbursements under this line, with an original maturity of August 30, 2024. The 2023 Loan requires at least monthly payments of plus interest accrued on the unpaid balance of the loan at the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus , floating, provided that at no time shall the annual interest rate be less than . On August 28, 2024, the Bank extended the maturity date of the 2023 Loan from August 30, 2024 to March 31, 2025, at which time the full unpaid principal balance owed under the Credit Agreement, together with all interest, shall be due and payable in full. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company had and , respectively, outstanding on the 2023 Loan, bearing interest for both periods at , plus . The 2023 Loan was included in current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The 2012 Loan is evidenced by promissory notes in the amounts of and , the repayment of which is partially guaranteed under the provisions of a United States Department of Agriculture USDA Rural Development Guarantee program. The proceeds of the 2012 Loan were used to acquire processing equipment and leasehold improvements at its Kona, Hawaii facility. 
 
 The provisions of the 2012 Loan required the payment of interest only for the first months of the term; thereafter, and until its maturity on August 14, 2032, the obligation fully amortizes over nineteen 19 years. Interest on the 2012 Loan accrues on the outstanding principal balance at an annual variable rate equal to the published Wall Street Journal prime rate at both September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 plus and is adjustable on the first day of each calendar quarter and fixed for that quarter, provided that at no time shall the annual interest rate be less than .

The USDA has guaranteed of all amounts owing under the 2012 Loan. The balance in unamortized debt issuance costs was and at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, and was included in current maturities of long-term debt in the debt table above.

Loan Covenants, Violation and Waiver 
 
 The Company s 2023 Loan and the 2012 Loan are subject to annual debt service and other financial covenants, including covenants which require the Company to meet key financial ratios and customary affirmative and negative covenants. As of March 31, 2023, the Company was not in compliance with the required debt service coverage ratio, however, was in compliance with the two other covenants. Due to this violation, the Bank would be contractually entitled to require immediate repayment of the outstanding term loans and the outstanding line of credit balance. On June 22, 2023, the Bank issued the Company a letter waiving the covenant violation as of March 31, 2023, and implemented an immediate freeze on any and all further advances of the Credit Agreement through the maturity date. As of March 31, 2024, the Company was not in compliance with the debt service coverage and current ratio, however, was in compliance with the third covenant. On September 12, 2024, the Bank issued a letter waiving the covenant violations as of March 31, 2024, but noting that the Bank reserves its right to declare a default in the future, if any covenants remain out of compliance at applicable measurement dates. 
 
 Although the 2012 Loan matures in August 2032, it is probable that a debt covenant violation occurs within the next twelve months. Therefore, the 2012 Loan and related unamortized debt issuance costs are classified as current on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company recorded income tax expense and of income tax expense for the six months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, with the effective tax rate of and ), respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of as a result of state taxes (net of federal benefit) and the net change in valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset the Company believes is not more likely than not to be realized. The Company continues to carry a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets. 
 
 The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and eleven state jurisdictions. The preparation of tax returns requires management to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company. Management, in consultation with its tax advisors, files its tax returns based on interpretations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The income tax returns, however, are subject to routine reviews by the various taxing authorities. As part of these reviews, a taxing authority may disagree with respect to the tax positions taken by management uncertain tax positions and therefore may require the Company to pay additional taxes. Management evaluates the requirement for additional tax accruals, including interest and penalties, which the Company could incur as a result of the ultimate resolution of its uncertain tax positions. Management reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities, completion of tax audits, expiration of statute of limitations, or upon occurrence of other events. 

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was liability for income tax associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as well as any related penalties in interest income or expense in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods. 
 
 In general, the Company s open tax years range from fiscal years ended 2020 to 2024. The Company has net operating loss carry forwards, which cause the federal and state statutes to remain open for earlier fiscal years. 

Basic and diluted per share amounts are the same in periods of a net loss because common share equivalents are anti-dilutive when a net loss is recorded. Diluted earnings per share does not include the impact of common stock options and restricted stock units totaling and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Diluted earnings per share does not include the impact of common stock options and restricted stock units totaling and for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Restricted stock units become dilutive within the period granted and remain dilutive until the units vest and are then included in the calculation of basic earnings per share. 

pursuant to a Promissory Note (the Skywords Note executed by the Company in favor of Skywords. Skywords is controlled by the Company s Chairman of the Board of Directors and largest stockholder. The Skywords Note bore interest at a rate of plus the prime rate (as published by the Wall Street Journal), which was recalculated and payable on a quarterly basis.

Item 2. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview: 
 
 We are an agricultural company and a world leader in the production of natural products derived from microalgae grown in complex and intricate agricultural systems on the Kona coast of Hawaii. Incorporated in 1983, we are guided by the principle of providing beneficial, quality microalgal products for health and human nutrition in a sustainable, reliable and environmentally sensitive operation. We are Good Manufacturing Practices GMP certified by the Merieux NutriSciences, reinforcing our commitment to quality in our products, quality in our relationships (with our customers, suppliers, employees and the communities we live in), and quality of the environment in which we work. Our products include: 

BioAstin Hawaiian Astaxanthin - a powerful, natural antioxidant clinically studied to support and maintain the body s natural inflammatory response, to enhance skin, and to support eye, joint and immune health . It has expanding applications as a human dietary supplement and dietary ingredient; and 

Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica - a nutrient-rich superfood dietary supplement clinically supported for natural energy, immune system support, cardiovascular health and as a source of antioxidant carotenoids 

These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. 
 
 Microalgae are a diverse group of microscopic plants that have a wide range of physiological and biochemical characteristics and contain, among other things, high levels of natural protein, amino acids, vitamins, pigments and enzymes. Microalgae have the following properties that make commercial production attractive: (1) microalgae grow much faster than land grown plants, often up to 100 times faster; (2) microalgae have uniform cell structures with no bark, stems, branches or leaves, permitting easier extraction of products and higher utilization of the microalgae cells; and (3) the cellular uniformity of microalgae makes it practical to control the growing environment in order to optimize a particular cell characteristic. Efficient and effective cultivation of microalgae requires consistent light, warm temperatures, low rainfall and proper chemical balance in a very nutrient-rich environment, free of environmental contaminants and unwanted organisms. This is a challenge that has motivated us to design, develop and implement proprietary production and harvesting technologies, systems and processes in order to commercially produce human dietary supplement products derived from microalgae. 
 
 Our production of these products at the 96-acre facility on the Kona Coast of the island of Hawaii provides several benefits. We selected the Keahole Point location in order to take advantage of relatively consistent warm temperatures, sunshine and low levels of rainfall needed for optimal cultivation of microalgae. This location also offers us access to cold deep ocean water, drawn from an offshore depth of 2,000 feet, which we use in our Ocean-Chill Drying system to eliminate the oxidative damage caused by standard drying techniques and as a source of trace nutrients for microalgal cultures. The area is also designated a Biosecure Zone, with tight control of organisms allowed into the area and free of genetically modified organisms GMO ). We believe that our technology, systems, processes and favorable growing location generally permit year-round harvest of our microalgal products in a cost-effective manner.

Net Sales The net sales decrease of 8.3 for the current quarter compared to the same period last year was driven by a decrease in both astaxanthin and spirulina packaged sales, offset by an increase in spirulina bulk sales and contract extraction revenue. During the current year quarter, we saw lower demand in packaged sales due to timing of shipments, offset by higher demand in spirulina bulk related to both timing of customer orders and increased demand. 
 
 Gross Profit Gross profit as a percent of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased by 7.5 percentage points compared to the same period last year, which was the result of higher bulk sales with lower gross margins, and higher inventory costs due to lower production volumes. 
 
 Operating Expenses Operating expenses of 2.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year same quarter, decreased 0.2 million. Sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to lower online selling fees and advertising costs. 
 
 Income Taxes We did not record income tax expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and recorded an income tax expense of 2,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. We continue to carry a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets.

Net Sales The net sales increase of 1.9 for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the same period last year was driven by an increase in astaxanthin and spirulina bulk and contract extraction sales, offset by a decrease in both astaxanthin and spirulina packaged sales. We saw higher demand in bulk sales related to both timing of customer orders and increased demand over prior year, offset by decreased packaged sales due to the timing of shipments. 
 
 Gross Profit Gross profit as a percent of net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2025 decreased by 6.2 percentage points compared to the same period last year, which was the result of higher bulk sales with lower gross margins, and higher inventory costs due to lower production volumes. 
 
 Operating Expenses Operating expenses of 5.0 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year same period, decreased 0.5 million. Sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to lower online selling fees, advertising and commissions, as well as lower research and development costs related to lower headcount. 
 
 Income Taxes We did not record income tax expense for the first six months of fiscal 2025 and recorded an income tax expense of 2,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2024. We continue to carry a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. 
 
 Liquidity and Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, as of and for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and as of March 31, 2024, have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We sustained operating losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations for most of these same periods. Further, as discussed below, we were not in compliance with two debt covenant requirements at March 31, 2024 and one debt covenant requirement at March 31, 2023. In June 2023, the Bank instituted a freeze on additional advances from the Line of Credit. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities, and reported expense that may be necessary if we were unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 0.8 million and working capital of 0.6 million compared to 0.7 million and 2.0 million, respectively, at March 31, 2024. We had a Line of Credit with the Bank that provided for borrowings up to 2.0 million on a revolving basis, however, as part of the covenant waiver at March 31, 2023, the borrowings under this Line of Credit were frozen. On October 13, 2023, the Bank converted this Line of Credit to the 2023 Loan in the amount of 1.48 million with an original maturity date of August 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had 1.0 million and 1.24 million, respectively, outstanding on the 2023 Loan, with a maturity date, which was extended to March 31, 2025. (See Note 5 in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements).

Table of Contents 

We also have a loan facility with a related party that allows us to borrow up to 4.0 million on the Revolver. At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had 2.0 million and 1.25 million, respectively, outstanding borrowings on the Revolver, which was included in line of credit related party on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Revolver expires on April 12, 2026 (see Notes 5 and 12 in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 3.1 million in the 2012 Loan payable to the Bank that require the payment of principal and interest monthly through August 2032. Pursuant to the 2012 Loan and the 2023 Loan, we are subject to annual financial covenants, customary affirmative and negative covenants and certain subjective acceleration clauses. As of March 31, 2024, our debt service coverage ratio and current ratio fell short of the Bank s annual requirement. On September 12, 2024, the Bank provided us with a letter waiving the covenant violations as of March 31, 2024, but noting that the Bank reserves its right to declare a default in the future if any covenants remain out of compliance at applicable measurement dates. 
 
 In April 2019, we obtained a loan in the amount of 1.5 million from a related party. The proceeds were used to pay down accounts payable and for general operating capital purposes. On April 12, 2021, December 14, 2022, August 14, 2023, and August 9, 2024, we amended this loan (see Notes 5 and 12 in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements). As of both September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had 1.0 million outstanding on the related party note. The loan matures on April 12, 2027. 
 
 We continue to experience a loss from operations as the impacts from the macroeconomic environment led to lower sales across our portfolio, therefore, we continue to rely on our funding source to provide liquidity. To address the resulting cash flow challenges, we continue to monitor cost savings initiatives implemented in fiscal year 2023, including stopping or slowing production of inventory in alignment with current customer demand, maintaining a reduced headcount and compensation, primarily through attrition and furloughs, respectively, and eliminating certain discretionary selling, general and administrative expenses. We have also made changes in the sales and marketing team starting with the Chief Commercial Officer and strengthening the sales team, re-positioning the brand(s) and optimizing our marketing efforts to emphasize our competitive strengths. In addition, we raised capital by completing a private placement in the third fiscal quarter of 2024. 
 
 Funds generated by operating activities and available cash are our most significant sources of liquidity for working capital requirements, debt service and funding of maintenance levels of capital expenditures. We have developed our operating plan to produce a significant portion of our cash flows necessary to meet all financing requirements, with the remaining need for capital raising. Although we have a history of either being in compliance with debt covenants or obtaining the necessary waivers, execution of our operating plan is dependent on many factors, some of which are not within the control of the Company. However, no assurances can be provided that we will achieve our operating plan and cash flow projections for this fiscal year or our projected consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2025. Such estimates are subject to change based on future results and such change could cause future results to vary significantly from expected results. 
 
 Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated in thousands):

Increase in cash

262 

Cash used in operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was the result of a net loss of 2.4 million less non-cash items of 1.1 million, offset by lower inventories and higher accounts payable as we continue to closely manage inventory and have increased the purchase of materials to support an increase in production to meet customer needs. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 primarily includes costs for capital improvements at our Kona facility. 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 consists of additional draws on the related party line of credit of 750,000, offset by the paydown of 240,000 on the 2023 Loan and 127,000 of debt service payments. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Capital 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our working capital was 550 thousand, a decrease of 1.5 million compared to March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable due to sales demand, timing and receipt of cash payments and inventories in the first half of fiscal year 2025, as we continue to manage our production in line with sales demand and material supplies are being managed on a just-in-time basis. We also had additional draw on the related party line of credit.

Our results of operations and financial condition can be affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and could cause future results of operations to fluctuate materially as it has in the past. Future operating results may fluctuate as a result of changes in sales volumes to our largest customers, weather patterns, increased competition, increased materials, nutrient and energy costs, government regulations and other factors beyond our control. 
 
 A significant portion of our expense levels are relatively fixed, so the timing of increases in expenses is based in large part on forecasts of future sales. If net sales are below expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on results of operations may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the sales shortfall. We may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to market conditions, which may have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Outlook 
 
 This outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. 
 
 Our strategic direction has been to position as a world leader in the production and marketing of high-value natural products from microalgae. We are vertically aligned, producing raw materials in the form of microalgae processed at our 96-acre facility in Hawaii, and integrating those raw materials into finished products. Our primary focus is stabilizing our production volume, rationalizing market channel participation, and leveraging our centers of core competence. We will continue to place emphasis on our Nutrex Hawaiian consumer products while exploring further opportunities for bulk sales orders for Spirulina and Astaxanthin, both domestically and internationally. Extraction services to third party customers utilizing our 1,000 bar, supercritical carbon dioxide extractor process are expected to generate additional income throughout the year. We will leverage our experience and reputation for quality, nutritional products which promote health and well-being. The foundation of our nutritional products is naturally cultivated Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica in powder and tablet form; and BioAstin Hawaiian Astaxanthin antioxidant in extract and softgel form. Information about our Company and our products can be viewed at www.cyanotech.com and www.nutrex-hawaii.com. Consumer products can also be purchased online at www.nutrex-hawaii.com. 
 
 Gross profit margin percentages going forward can be impacted by lower production volumes along with pressure on input costs as well as greater competition in the market place. This could cause margins to decline in future periods. We will continue to focus on higher margin consumer products that promote health and well-being and strive for continuous improvements in processes and production methods to stabilize costs and production levels for the future. However, significant sales variability between periods may occur based on historical results. 
 
 Producing the highest quality microalgae is a complex biological process which requires balancing numerous factors including microalgal strain variation, temperature, acidity, nutrient and other environmental considerations, some of which are not within our control. An imbalance or unexpected event can occur resulting in production levels below normal capacity. The allocation of fixed production overheads (such as depreciation, rent and general insurance) to inventories is determined based on normal production capacity. When our production volumes are below normal capacity limits, certain fixed production overhead costs cannot be inventoried and are recorded immediately in cost of sales. In addition, when production costs exceed historical averages, we evaluate whether such costs are one-time-period charges or an ongoing component of inventory cost. 
 
 To manage our cash resources effectively, we will balance production with sales demand, minimizing the cost associated with inventory levels when appropriate and manage our expenses judiciously. We could experience unplanned cash outflows and may need to utilize other cash resources to meet working capital needs. A prolonged downturn in sales could impair our ability to generate sufficient cash for operations and hamper our ability to attract additional capital investment which could become necessary to maintain optimal production levels and efficiencies. 
 
 Our future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this Outlook, in particular the statements regarding revenues, gross margin and capital spending, involve a number of risks and uncertainties. In addition to the factors discussed above, any of the following could cause actual results to differ materially: business conditions and growth in the natural products industry and in the general economy; changes in customer order patterns; changes in demand for natural products in general; changes in weather conditions; changes in health and growing conditions of our astaxanthin and spirulina products; competitive factors, such as increased production capacity from competing spirulina and astaxanthin producers and the resulting impact, if any, on world market prices for these products; government actions and increased regulations both domestic and foreign; shortage of manufacturing capacity; and other factors beyond our control. Risk factors are discussed in detail in Part II, Item 1A of this quarterly report and in Part I, Item 1A of our Form 10-K report for the year ended March 31, 2024.

We believe that our technology, systems, processes and favorable growing location generally permit year-round harvest of our microalgal products in a cost-effective manner. However, previously experienced imbalances in the highly complex biological production systems, together with volatile energy costs and rapidly changing world markets, suggest a need for continuing caution with respect to variables beyond our reasonable control. Therefore, we cannot, and do not attempt to, provide any definitive assurance with regard to our technology, systems, processes, location, or cost-effectiveness. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations. 
 
 Impact of Inflation 
 
 Inflationary factors such as increases in the costs of materials, utilities and labor affected our operations. We have seen stabilization in our underlying costs, however, we are also experiencing overall lower demand as consumers are feeling the impacts of higher inflation and are closely managing their discretionary spend. The exact impact on our results is difficult to isolate and quantify given the macroeconomic environment. Most of our leases provide for cost-of-living adjustments and require us to pay for insurance and maintenance expenses, all of which are subject to inflation. Additionally, our future lease cost for new facilities may include potentially escalating costs of real estate and construction. There is no assurance that we will be able to pass on increased costs to our customers. 
 
 Depreciation expense is based on the historical cost of fixed assets and is therefore potentially less than it would be if it were based on current replacement cost. While property and equipment acquired in prior years will ultimately have to be replaced at higher prices, it is expected that replacement will be a gradual process over many years. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates are disclosed in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on June 26, 2024. In the six months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes to the application of critical accounting policies previously disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Cyanotech Reports Financial Results for the Second Quarter and First Six Months of Fiscal 2025 

KAILUA KONA, Hawaii (November 12, 2024) Cyanotech Corporation (OTCQB: CYAN), a world leader in microalgae-based, high-value nutrition and health dietary supplement products, announced financial results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal year 2025, ended September 30, 2024. 

Commenting on the second quarter fiscal year 2025 results, Cyanotech s President and Chief Executive Officer, Matthew K. Custer, said: 

In prior quarters, our inventory levels were reduced to just-in-time levels to manage cash flow and strong sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased inventory. However, mid-quarter financing allowed us to start restocking, increasing work-in-progress inventory by 1.9 million, even though finished goods were still down by 1.5 million. 

Bulk inventory, which has a shorter production time, helped drive a 39 increase in sales, and revenue from contract extraction grew by 156 . However, packaged goods, which take longer to restock, saw a 21 decrease due to stock shortages and timing issues, contributing to an overall 8 drop in total sales for the quarter. 

For the first half of the year, sales were up 2 . While progress with packaged goods has been slower than expected, we're working quickly to replenish stock and continue promoting our algae-based products farmed in Hawaii's pristine waters. 

Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 

 Cyanotech reported net sales of 5,845,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 6,373,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, a decrease of 8.3 . Gross profit was 1,479,000, with gross profit margin of 25.3 , compared to gross profit of 2,088,000, with gross profit margin of 32.8 . Operating loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 975,000 compared to operating loss of 632,000 in the same period of the prior year. Net loss for the current fiscal quarter was 1,150,000, or 0.16 per diluted share, compared to net loss of 797,000, or 0.13 per diluted share, for the same period of the prior year. 

First Six Months of Fiscal 2025 

 Cyanotech reported net sales of 11,743,000 for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 11,519,000 for the same period in fiscal 2024, an increase of 1.9 . Gross profit was 2,956,000, with gross profit margin of 25.2 , compared to gross profit of 3,620,000, with gross profit margin of 31.4 . Operating loss for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was 2,016,000 compared to operating loss of 1,841,000 in the same period of the prior year. Net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was 2,352,000, or 0.34 per diluted share, compared to net loss of 2,166,000, or 0.34 per diluted share, for the same period of the prior year. 

Trailing Twelve Months 

 For the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2023, net sales were 23,295,000 compared to 22,801,000, respectively. Gross profit was 5,280,000, with gross profit margin of 22.7 , compared to 6,771,000 and 29.7 . Net loss was 5,452,000, or 0.80 per diluted share, compared to net loss of 4,195,000, or 0.67 per diluted share.
