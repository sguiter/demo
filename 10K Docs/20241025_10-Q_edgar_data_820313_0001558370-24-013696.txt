The grant-date fair value of each option grant under the 2009 Employee Option Plan and the 2017 Option Plan is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The grant-date fair value of each share grant is determined based on the closing share price of the Company s Common Stock on the date of the grant. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model for option grants requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected share price volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the Common Stock and implied volatility derived from related exchange traded options. The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option and expected exercise and historical experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issuances with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share is based on the Company s dividend rate.

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 On August 16, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA ), a tax and spending package that introduces several tax-related provisions, including a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax CAMT on certain large corporations and a 1 excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases. Companies are required to reassess their valuation allowances for certain affected deferred tax assets in the period of enactment but do not need to remeasure deferred tax balances for the related tax accounting implications of the CAMT. The IRA provisions, which became effective for Amphenol beginning on January 1, 2023, did not have a material impact on the Company during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. While the full impact of these provisions in the future depends on several factors, including interpretive regulatory guidance, which has not yet been released, the Company does not currently believe that the provisions of the IRA, including several other non-tax related provisions, will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.

 Pillar Two Framework The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework, known as Pillar Two, provides guidance for a global minimum tax. This guidance lays out a common approach for adopting the global minimum tax and enacting local legislation codifying the provisions that all 142 countries in the Inclusive Framework agreed to by consensus. The European Union EU member states have agreed to adopt these rules in two stages. The first component became effective on January 1, 2024, and the second component will become effective January 1, 2025. Non-EU countries have enacted or are expected to enact legislation on a similar timeline. Certain countries in which we operate have already enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar Two framework, while several other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation with varying effective dates in the future. When and how this framework is adopted or enacted by the various countries in which we do business will increase tax complexity and may increase uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The Company has done a preliminary review of currently enacted legislation. The initial implementation did not have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and it is not currently expected to have a material impact on the Company s operations, financial condition or cash flows in the future. However, the Company will continue to evaluate the potential impact of Pillar Two on the Company and its results as additional countries adopt legislation and issue individual guidance on their enacted legislation. Results of Operations Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 Net sales were 4,038.8 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3,199.2 in the third quarter of 2023, representing an increase of 26 in U.S. dollars, 26 in constant currencies and 15 organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts), compared to the prior year period.

 (1) Percentages in this table were calculated using actual, unrounded results; therefore, the sum of the components may not add due to rounding. (2) Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. While the term net sales growth in U.S. dollars is not considered a U.S. GAAP financial measure, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measure based on GAAP results, which serves as the basis for the reconciliation to its comparable non-GAAP financial measures. (3) Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the percentage impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current reporting period(s) compared to the same respective period(s) in the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting net sales for the current reporting period(s) translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year period(s) from net sales for the current reporting period(s), taken as a percentage of the respective prior year period(s) net sales. (4) Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this Item 2. (5) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the percentage impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions that have not been included in the Company s consolidated results for the full current period(s) and/or prior comparable period(s) presented. Such net sales related to these acquisitions do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Acquisition impact is calculated as a percentage of the respective prior year period(s) net sales. (6) Net sales by geographic area are based on the customer location to which the product is shipped. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar for the third quarter of 2024 had the effect of increasing sales by approximately 9.2 for such period, relative to the comparable period in 2023. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar for the first nine months of 2024 had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately 34.9 for such period, relative to the comparable period in 2023.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 492.0, or 12.2 of net sales, and 1,340.4, or 12.3 of net sales, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 381.6, or 11.9 of net sales, and 1,095.7, or 11.9 of net sales, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The increases in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were primarily driven by the effect of acquisitions, which currently have higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales compared to the Company average. Administrative expenses represented approximately 5.0 and 4.9 of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and represented approximately 4.9 and 4.8 of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Research and development expenses represented approximately 3.1 and 3.0 of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and represented approximately 2.7 of net sales for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.1 and 4.3 of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and represented approximately 4.3 of net sales for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. Operating income was 819.5, or 20.3 of net sales, and 2,203.2, or 20.2 of net sales, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 657.9, or 20.6 of net sales, and 1,869.6, or 20.3 of net sales, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Operating income for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 includes 63.6 and 133.6, respectively, of acquisition-related expenses, comprised primarily of (i) the amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from the Carlisle Interconnect Technologies CIT acquisition and external transaction costs associated with acquisitions (such acquisition-related expenses aggregating 45.4 and 115.4, respectively, are presented separately in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) and (ii) the amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up costs in the third quarter of 2024 of 18.2 associated with the CIT acquisition (such costs are recorded in Cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) . Operating income for the third quarter of 2023 included 9.0 of acquisition-related expenses, comprised of external transaction costs related to acquisitions. Operating income for the first nine months of 2023 included 18.4 of acquisition-related expenses, comprised of external transaction costs incurred in the second and third quarters of 2023, as well as the amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from an acquisition that closed in the first quarter of 2023. Acquisition-related expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are presented separately in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the acquisition-related expenses had the effect of decreasing net income by 49.8, or 0.04 per share, and 109.7, or 0.09 per share, respectively, while for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the acquisition-related expenses had the effect of decreasing net income by 8.4, or 0.01 per share, and 16.2, or 0.01 per share, respectively, as shown in the tables below. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, each as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below, were 883.1, or 21.9 of net sales, and 666.9, or 20.8 of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin were 2,336.8, or 21.4 of net sales, and 1,888.0, or 20.5 of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases in Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 relative to the comparable periods in 2023 were primarily driven by strong operating performance on the higher sales volumes, partially offset by the negative impact on operating margin related to acquisitions completed within the prior twelve months that are currently operating below the average operating margin of the Company. Operating income for the Harsh Environment Solutions segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 283.7, or 23.8 of net sales, and 787.8, or 25.0 of net sales, respectively, compared to 239.1, or 26.9 of net sales, and 705.7, or 26.8 of net sales, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The decreases in operating margin for the Harsh Environment Solutions segment for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 relative to the comparable periods in 2023 were primarily driven by the negative impact on operating margin related to acquisitions completed within the prior twelve months, particularly the CIT acquisition, that are currently operating below the average operating margin of the Company.

 Operating income for the Communications Solutions segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 431.0, or 25.6 of net sales, and 1,067.7, or 24.3 of net sales, respectively, compared to 283.3, or 22.1 of net sales, and 752.4, or 21.1 of net sales, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The increases in operating margin for the Communications Solutions segment for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 relative to the comparable periods in 2023 were primarily driven by strong operating performance on the higher sales volumes. Operating income for the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 217.6, or 18.8 of net sales, and 616.3, or 18.4 of net sales, respectively, compared to 188.9, or 18.3 of net sales, and 553.6, or 18.3 of net sales, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The modest increases in operating margin for the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 relative to the comparable periods in 2023 were primarily driven by strong operating performance on the higher sales volumes, partially offset by the negative impact on operating margin related to acquisitions completed within the prior twelve months that are currently operating below the average operating margin of the Company. Interest expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 55.7 and 150.1, respectively, compared to 33.6 and 104.5 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The increases in interest expense for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were driven by higher average borrowing levels, primarily intended to fully or partially fund acquisitions, including the CIT acquisition, along with the higher interest rate environment. Provision for income taxes for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was at an effective tax rate of 21.4 and 19.6 , respectively. Provision for income taxes for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 was at an effective tax rate of 18.2 and 20.3 , respectively. Various items incurred in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 had an impact on the Company s effective tax rate and earnings per share , which impacted the effective tax rate and earnings per share by the amounts noted in the tables below. For the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023, these items included excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity, along with the tax effect of the aforementioned acquisition-related expenses incurred during each period. In addition, for the first nine months of 2024, the effective tax rate was further impacted by a discrete tax benefit related to the settlement of tax audits and associated lapses of statutes of limitation, along with a difference in a non-U.S. tax filing position. For the first nine months of 2023, the effective tax rate was further impacted by the gain from the bargain purchase acquisition that closed in the second quarter of 2023 . Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below within this Item 2, for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 24.0 , as reconciled in the tables below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to income taxes. Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation per common share - Diluted Diluted EPS were 604.4 and 0.48, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 513.9 and 0.41, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. Excluding the effect of the items listed in the tables below, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below within this Item 2, were 632.8 and 0.50, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 484.0 and 0.39, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Diluted EPS were 1,677.8 and 1.33, respectively, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 1,413.6 and 1.14, respectively, for the first nine months of 2023. Excluding the effect of the items listed in the tables below, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS were 1,686.9 and 1.34, respectively, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 1,357.1 and 1.09, respectively, for the first nine months of 2023.

(2) All percentages and per share amounts in this table were calculated using actual, unrounded results; therefore, the sum of the components may not add due to rounding. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Cash Requirements As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 1,583.3 and 1,660.2, respectively, with the majority of the Company s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand located outside of the United States. The Company s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash provided by operating activities, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, as well as availability under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the Euro Commercial Paper Program, and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that these sources of liquidity, along with access to capital markets (which the Company accessed in early April 2024 in connection with the issuance of the New Senior Notes), provide adequate liquidity to meet both its short-term (next 12 months) and reasonably foreseeable long-term requirements and obligations. The Company s debt instruments are defined and discussed in more detail below within this Item 2.

Table of Contents 
 Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations The Company s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and working capital needs, capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of our Common Stock, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of all of the Company s pre-2018 accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries Transition Tax ), which is payable in annual installments until 2025, taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings), funding of pension obligations, and other contractual obligations and commitments included in Item 7 of the 2023 Annual Report. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of future acquisitions, as has been the case in recent years with the Company s various acquisitions, including the acquisition of CIT in May 2024. The Company s debt service requirements primarily consist of principal and interest on the Company s Senior Notes, and to the extent of any amounts outstanding, the Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Programs (all as defined below). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program. However, the Company borrowed under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program throughout much of the first nine months of 2024, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, partially funding the acquisition of CIT in May 2024, as discussed later within this Item 2. Although all such borrowings were repaid before the end of the third quarter of 2024, the Company may make additional borrowings under any of its debt instruments in the future. Although the federal funds rate has increased in recent years, causing the floating interest rates related to our U.S. Commercial Paper Program (as well as our Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent drawn upon in the future) to also increase substantially, the U.S. Federal Reserve recently lowered the federal funds rate modestly in September of 2024. To the extent that interest rates related to this floating rate debt decrease further and the Company borrows under any of these floating interest rate instruments in the future (and consistent with current year levels), interest expense and interest payments would decrease. Although the Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows for the remainder of 2024, there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly from current levels. Repatriation of Foreign Earnings and Related Income Taxes The Company has previously indicated an intention to repatriate most of its pre-2024 accumulated earnings and has accrued the foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, if applicable, on those earnings, as appropriate. The associated tax payments are due as the repatriations are made. The Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining pre-2024 foreign earnings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has accrued the foreign and U.S. state and local taxes associated with the foreign earnings that it intends to repatriate. The Company intends to evaluate future earnings for repatriation, and will accrue for those distributions where appropriate, and to indefinitely reinvest all other foreign earnings.

 Operating Activities The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company s fundamental financial strengths. Net cash provided by operating activities Operating Cash Flow was 1,967.6 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1,686.9 in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in Operating Cash Flow for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 is primarily due to the increase in net income, partially offset by a higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital. In the first nine months of 2024, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased 197.6, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable of 358.9, inventories of 186.0 and prepaid expenses and other current assets of 83.2 , partially offset by increases in accounts payable of 319.2 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of 111.3. In the first nine months of 2023, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased 81.2, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to decreases in accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of 90.3 and accounts payable of 88.1, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 17.2, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of 83.8 and inventories of 30.6. The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. Accounts receivable increased 511.9 to 3,130.3, primarily due to the higher sales in the third quarter of 2024 relative to the fourth quarter of 2023, along with the impact of the two acquisitions (the 2024 Acquisitions that closed during the first nine months of 2024 and the effect of translation from exchange rate changes Translation at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. Days sales outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 69 days and 70 days, respectively. Inventories increased 411.7 to 2,578.8, primarily due to the impact of the 2024 Acquisitions, along with the impact of higher sales in the third quarter of 2024 relative to the fourth quarter of 2023 and Translation . Inventory days at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 87 days and 85 days, respectively. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased 90.8 to 480.4, primarily due to increases in various prepaid expenses and other current receivables, along with the impact of the 2024 Acquisitions . Property, plant and equipment, net, increased 356.2 to 1,670.9, primarily due to capital expenditures of 465.6 and the impact of the 2024 Acquisitions, partially offset by depreciation of 276.9. Goodwill increased 1,259.7 to 8,352.1, primarily driven by goodwill recognized from the 2024 Acquisitions, in particular the CIT acquisition . Other intangible assets, net, increased 412.2 to 1,247.0, primarily due to the recognition of certain intangible assets related to the 2024 Acquisitions, in particular the CIT acquisition, partially offset by the amortization associated with the Company s current intangible assets as well as measurement period adjustments related to certain intangible assets associated with acquisitions that closed late in 2023. Other long-term assets increased 93.6 to 542.8, primarily due to an increase in operating lease right-of-use assets resulting from new and renewed lease agreements entered into during the first nine months of 2024 as well as acquired leases resulting from acquisitions. Accounts payable increased 412.1 to 1,763.0, primarily due to incr eased purchasing activity related to the higher sales levels in the third quarter of 2024 relative to the fourth quarter of 2023, along with the impact of the 2024 Acquisitions and Translation. Payable days at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 59 days and 55 days, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased 287.6 to 1,735.6, primarily as a result of increases in accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits and various other accrued expenses, along with the impact of the 2024 Acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in accrued income taxes. Other long-term liabilities, including deferred tax liabilities, increased 108.0 to 928.7, primarily as a result of an increase in deferred tax liabilities resulting from the 2024 Acquisitions, along with an increase in long-term lease liabilities resulting from new and renewed lease agreements entered into during the first nine months of 2024 as well as acquired leases resulting from acquisitions.

 In addition to Operating Cash Flow, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase in Free Cash Flow was driven by an increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Operating Cash Flow (GAAP) 1,967.6 1,686.9 Capital expenditures (GAAP) (465.6) (267.8) Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment (GAAP) 7.1 2.1 Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) 1,509.1 1,421.2 Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities primarily consist of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, net purchases (sales and maturities) of short- and long-term investments, and acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities was 2,398.2 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 704.4 in the first nine months of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by the use of 2,099.8 to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures (net of disposals) of 458.5, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of 161.0. In the first nine months of 2023, net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by the use of 292.6 to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of 265.7, and net purchases of short-term and long-term investments of 151.0. The elevated capital expenditures for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were driven by investments primarily in support of the growth in our IT datacom and defense markets. We expect this elevated level of capital spending to continue for the fourth quarter of 2024. Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities primarily consist of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of Common Stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments, and distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Net cash provided by financing activities was 515.8 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 822.4 in the first nine months of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by (i) net cash proceeds from borrowings of 1,500.1, primarily related to the issuance of the New Senior Notes (as defined below), and (ii) cash proceeds of 320.3 from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by (a) repurchases of the Company s Common Stock of 520.4, (b) dividend payments of 396.2, (c) debt repayments of 353.7, primarily related to the redemption of the 3.20 Senior Notes in the second quarter of 2024, (d) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of 20.8, and (e) payments of 14.7 related to debt financing costs associated with the Company s amended and restated revolving credit facility in March 2024 as well as the issuances of the New Senior Notes in April 2024, as discussed further below.

Free Cash Flow is defined as (i) Net cash provided by operating activities Operating Cash Flow - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less (ii) capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), net of proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), all of which are derived from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to stockholders through either stock repurchases or dividends. Organic Net Sales Growth is defined as the period-over-period percentage change in net sales growth resulting from operating volume and pricing changes and excludes the impact of (i) changes in foreign currency exchange rates (described above), which is outside the control of the Company, and (ii) acquisitions, both of which are taken as a percentage of the respective prior period(s) net sales. The acquisition impact represents the percentage impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions that have not been included in the Company's consolidated results for the full current period(s) and/or prior comparable period(s) presented. Such net sales related to these acquisitions do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Management evaluates the Company s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Constant Currency Net Sales Growth (as defined above) and Organic Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company s disclosures of its critical accounting policies and estimates, which are discussed in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of its 2023 Annual Report, have not materially changed since that report was filed. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions) The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. The Company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty. There has been no material change in the Company s assessment of its sensitivity to foreign currency exchange rate risk since its presentation set forth in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in its 2023 Annual Report. From time to time, the Company may borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Programs. In addition to the outstanding borrowings under the Company s Euro Notes (as discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), any borrowings under the Euro Commercial Paper Program and Revolving Credit Facility have been and may continue to be denominated in various foreign currencies, including the Euro, and there can be no assurance that the Company can successfully manage changes in exchange rates, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies in which such borrowings are made. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The Company currently has various fixed rate senior notes outstanding, in both the United States and Europe, with various maturity dates, the most recent of which were issued in April 2024. In addition, any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at rates that fluctuate with a spread that varies, based on the Company s debt rating, over certain currency-specific benchmark rates, which benchmark rates in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings are either the base rate or the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). Any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs are subject to floating interest rates. Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program. However, the Company borrowed under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program throughout much of the first nine months of 2024, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, partially funding the acquisition of the Carlisle Interconnect Technologies CIT business in May 2024, as discussed further in Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Although all such borrowings were repaid before the end of the third quarter of 2024, the Company may make additional borrowings under any of its debt instruments from time to time. Although the federal funds rate has increased in recent years, causing the floating interest rates related to our U.S. Commercial Paper Program (as well as our Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent drawn upon in the future) to also increase substantially, the U.S. Federal Reserve recently lowered the federal funds rate modestly in September of 2024. To the extent that interest rates related to this floating rate debt decrease further and the Company borrows under any of these floating interest rate instruments in the future (and consistent with current year levels), interest expense and interest payments would decrease. Although the Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows for the remainder of 2024, there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly from current levels.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
