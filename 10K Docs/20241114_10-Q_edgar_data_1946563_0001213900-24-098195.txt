CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and
financial trends impacting the financial condition of our business. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future
performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will
be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made and/or management s
good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance
or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. 

Forward-looking statements include all statements
that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, 
 should, could, would, expect, intend, seek, plan, 
 anticipate, believe, estimate, project, predict, potential, 
 might, forecast, continue, or the negative of those terms, and similar expressions and comparable
terminology intended to reference future periods. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about: 

Our ability to effectively operate
our business segments; 

Our ability to manage our research,
development, expansion, growth and operating expenses; 

Our ability to evaluate and measure
our business, prospects and performance metrics; 

Our ability to compete, directly
and indirectly, and succeed in a highly competitive and evolving industry; 

Our ability to respond and adapt
to changes in technology and customer behavior; and 

Our ability to protect our intellectual
property and to develop, maintain and enhance a strong brand. 

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed,
estimated, expected, intended or planned. 

Factors or events that could cause our actual
results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements. Accordingly, the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should
not be regarded as representations that the results or conditions described in such statements will occur or that our objectives and plans
will be achieved, and we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements.

STATEMENTS 

units at a price of per unit for in net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting
discount and commission and other estimated offering expenses paid by the Company at closing (the IPO ). Each unit consisted
of one share of common stock, one tradeable warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share (a
 Tradeable Warrant ), and one non-tradeable warrant to purchase one share of the Company s common stock at an exercise
price of per share (a Non-tradeable Warrant ). The Tradeable Warrants and Non-Tradeable Warrants were immediately
exercisable on the date of issuance and will expire from the date of issuance (July 12, 2023 to July 12, 2028). 

The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day
over-allotment option to purchase up to shares of the Company s common stock at a price of per share and/or 
Tradeable Warrants at a price of per Tradeable Warrant and/or Non-tradeable Warrants at per Non-tradeable Warrant,
or any combination thereof (the IPO Over-Allotment ). On July 13, 2023, the underwriters partially exercised the Over-Allotment
and purchased an additional Tradeable Warrants and Non-tradeable Warrants. The Company also issued to the underwriters warrants
to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, at an exercise price of per share, equal to of the offering
price per unit (the IPO Representative Warrants ). The IPO Representative Warrants are exercisable for a period of 
from the date of issuance (July 14, 2023 to July 14, 2028). 

The units were offered and sold pursuant to the
Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-269483), originally filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC on January 31, 2023 (the IPO Registration Statement and the final prospectus filed with
the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Registration Statement was declared effective by the
SEC on July 11, 2023. The common stock and tradeable warrants began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on July 12, 2023 under the symbols
 SXTP and SXTPW, respectively. The closing of the IPO occurred on July 14, 2023. 

(b) Going Concern 

The Company s financial statements are prepared
on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of obligations in the normal course of business.
However, the Company has not demonstrated the ability to generate enough revenues to date to cover operating expenses and has accumulated
losses to date. This condition, among others, raises substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
for one year from the date these consolidated condensed financial statements are issued. 

In view of these
matters, continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to meet its financial requirements, raise additional
capital, and achieve gross profitability from their single marketed product. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to
the amount and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should the Company not continue as a going concern.

, as compared to cash and cash equivalents totaling at December 31, 2023. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used of cash in its operating activities. 

The Company s future results are subject
to substantial risks and uncertainties. The Company has operated at a loss for its entire history and there can be no assurance that it
will ever achieve or maintain profitability. The Company has historically funded its operations primarily with proceeds from sales of
common stock and warrants for the purchase of common stock, proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt, and borrowings under loan
and security agreements. 

The Company expects to need to raise additional
capital under structures available to the Company, including debt and/or equity offerings, which may not be on favorable terms. The Company
would not have sufficient funds to meet its obligations within twelve months from the issuance date of these consolidated condensed financial
statements. As such, there is uncertainty regarding the Company s ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business
effectively, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Debt financing and equity
financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting the Company s ability to take specific
actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If the Company raises funds through collaborations,
or other similar arrangements with third parties, it may have to relinquish valuable rights to its technologies, future revenue streams,
research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to the Company and/or may reduce the value
of its common stock. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, it may be required
to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market
its product candidates even if the Company would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates itself. 

The Company also expects to use cash and cash
equivalents to fund activities relating to commercial support for its existing product and any future clinical research trials and operating
activities. The Company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the initiation and
progress of clinical trials and research and product development programs; obtaining regulatory approvals and complying with applicable
laws and regulations; the timing and effectiveness of product commercialization activities, including marketing arrangements; the timing
and costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights; and the effect of competing
technological and market developments. 

The Company s capital commitments over the
next twelve months include interest obligations on the Company s debt arrangements of and to satisfy current accounts
payable and accrued expenses.

common shares to the Company for no consideration, thereby increasing the proportional ownership
of 60P, Inc. in 60P Australia Pty Ltd from to . The purpose of this assignment was to eliminate the related party conflict
associated with Geoffrey Dow s ultimate beneficial ownership in 60P Australia Pty Ltd being greater than that of other 60P, Inc.
shareholders. The increase in the Company s proportional interest is reflected as a contribution from noncontrolling interest in
the accompanying consolidated condensed statement of shareholders equity (deficit). 

(the Reverse Stock Split ), which was effective as of August 12,
2024. Proportional adjustments were made to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of the Company s
equity awards, warrants, and other equity instruments convertible into common stock, as well as the respective exercise prices, if applicable
in accordance with the terms of the instruments. Unless otherwise noted, all references to numbers of shares of the Company s common
stock and per share information presented in these consolidated condensed financial statements have been retroactively adjusted, as appropriate,
to reflect the Reverse Stock Split, including reclassifying an amount equal to the reduction in par value of common stock to additional
paid-in capital.

related to amounts in excess of FDIC Limits. The Company periodically assesses the credit risk associated with these financial institutions
and believes that the risk of loss is minimal.

(e) Knight Debt Conversion 

On January 9, 2023, and in two subsequent amendments,
the Company and Knight Therapeutics agreed to extinguish Knight s debt in the event of an IPO. Key points of this agreement are
as follows: 

The Parties agreed to fix Knight s
cumulative debt to the value as it stood on March 31, 2022, which consisted of in principal and in accumulated
interest should the Company execute an IPO that results in gross proceeds of at least prior to December 31, 2023. Should an
IPO not occur by January 1, 2024 then all terms of the original debt would resume including any interest earned after March 31, 2022. 

The Parties agreed to convert
the fixed principal amount into (i) that number of shares of common stock equal to dividing the principal amount by an amount equal to
the offering price of the common stock in the IPO discounted by , rounding up for fractional shares, in a number of common shares
up to of the Company s outstanding common stock after giving effect of the IPO; (ii) the Company will make a milestone payment
of million to Knight if, after the date of a Qualifying IPO, the Company sells Arakoda or if a Change of Control (as per the
definition included in the original loan agreement dated on December 10, 2015) occurs, provided that the purchaser of Arakoda 
or individual or entity gaining control of the Borrower is not the Lender or an affiliate of the Lender; (iii) following the License
and Supply agreement dated on December 10, 2015 and subsequently amended on January 21, 2019, an expansion of existing distribution rights
to tafenoquine/Arakoda to include COVID-19 indications as well as malaria prevention across the Territory as defined in said documents,
subject to US Army approval; and (iv) Company will retain Lender or an affiliate to provide financial consulting services, management,
strategic and/or regulatory advice of value per month for five years (the parties will negotiate the terms of that consulting
agreement separately in good faith).

, then rounding up. The Preferred Stock shall have the following rights, preferences, and designations:
(i) have a cumulative dividend accumulated annually on March 31; (ii) shall be non-voting stock; (iii) are not redeemable, (iv) be
convertible to shares of common stock at a price equal to the lower of (1) the price paid for the shares of common stock in the initial
public offering, as adjusted after the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split and (2) the 10 day volume weighted average share price
immediately prior to conversion; and (v) conversion of the preferred stock to common shares will be at the Company s sole discretion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Preferred Stock shall not be converted into shares of common stock if as a result of such conversion
Knight will own or more of our outstanding common stock. 

In addition to the conversion
of the debt, for a period commencing on January 1, 2022 and ending upon the earlier of 10 years after the Closing or the conversion or
redemption in full of the Preferred Stock, Company shall pay Lender a royalty equal to of the Company s net sales (the Royalty ),
where Net Sales has the same meaning as in the Company s license agreement with the U.S. Army for tafenoquine. Upon
success of the Qualified IPO, the Company shall calculate the royalty payable to Knight at the end of each calendar quarter. The Company
shall pay to Knight the royalty amounts due with respect to a given calendar quarter within fifteen (15) business days after the end
of such calendar quarter. Each payment of royalties due to Knight shall be accompanied by a statement specifying the total gross sales,
the net sales and the deductions taken to arrive to net sales. For clarification purposes, the first royalty payment will be performed
following the above instructions, on the first calendar quarter in which the Qualified IPO takes place and will cover the sales for the
period from January 1, 2022 until the end of said calendar quarter. 

The Company evaluated the January 9, 2023 exchange
agreement in accordance with ASC 470-50 and concluded that the debt qualified for debt extinguishment because a substantial conversion
feature was added to the debt terms. In January 2023, the Company recorded a loss upon extinguishment in the amount of and elected
to recognize the new debt under the ASC 825 fair value option until it was settled, which occurred in the third quarter of 2023 (see below).
Therefore, there were no amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

addition, the entirety of the accumulated interest as of March 31, 2022 converted into shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the
conversion rate detailed above, in full satisfaction of the Company s obligations with respect to the accumulated interest. Upon
consummation of the IPO and under the terms of the Knight Debt Conversion Agreement, the Company became obligated to the contingent milestone
payments and the accumulated Royalty discussed above, which value was included in the reacquisition price of the debt upon extinguishment.
The Company recognized a final mark-to-market adjustment of to adjust the Convertible Knight Loan to its fair value on the
date of settlement, and as a result, no gain or loss was recognized on the debt extinguishment. 

The Company performed an evaluation of the contingent
payment features and concluded that the contingent milestone payment is a freestanding financial instrument that meets the definition
of a derivative under ASC 815, and accordingly, the fair value of the derivative liability is marked to market each reporting period until

debenture of with an original issue discount of , which was being amortized using the effective interest method.
The Company subsequently restructured the Knight Loans, including the debenture, pursuant to the Knight Debt Conversion Agreement (see
above). of the original issue discount was amortized to interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 prior
to the amendment. The Knight Debt Conversion Agreement in January 2023 was accounted for as an extinguishment of the Debenture, as discussed
above. Therefore, there were no amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

(g) SBA COVID-19 EIDL 

On May 14, 2020, the Company received COVID-19

Prior to the Company s IPO, the fair value
of the Company s potential future issuances of common stock related to common stock issued with promissory notes, warrants and embedded
conversion features in convertible promissory notes was established with an estimate using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model to compute
fair value as of each reporting date. The Monte Carlo simulation requires the input of assumptions, including our stock price, the volatility
of our stock price, remaining term in years, expected dividend yield, and risk-free rate. In addition, the valuation model considered
the probability of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an IPO within the terms of liability-classified financial instruments, as an IPO
could potentially impact the settlement.

preceding December 31, or such number of shares as determined by the Board of Directors. On July 16, 2024, at the Company s 2024
Annual Stockholders Meeting, the Company s stockholders approved the proposal to amend the 2022 Plan to increase the number
of shares available for issuance by shares. As of September 30, 2024, the number of remaining shares available for issuance under
the 2022 Plan is equal to .

Stock Options 

The Company grants stock options to employees,
non-employees, and Directors with exercise prices equal to the closing price of the underlying shares of the Company s common stock
on the Nasdaq Capital Market on the date that the options are granted. Options granted generally have a term of five or ten years from
the grant date and are subject to vesting as determined in the individual award agreement. The Company estimates the fair value of stock
options on the grant date by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model.

in ASC 718. Florida State University Research Fund, Inc. agreed to render research and development services related to development of
celgosivir over a period of up to five years using the proceeds from the sale of the Company s common shares to fund the services.
Prepaid research and development costs recognized associated with the Florida State University Research Fund, Inc. are expected to be
rendered within one year. Kentucky Technology Inc. agreed to furnish a written report on the potential development of SJ733 + tafenoquine
in exchange for fully vested shares of the Company s common stock. On May 3, 2024, the Company indicated to Kentucky Technology,
Inc. that the report (delivered in April 2024) was acceptable to the Company. Upon acceptance, the Company recognized of share-based
compensation expense, which is reflected in Research and Development expense in the results of operations for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the unamortized balance of prepaid assets related to these share-based payments for research and development
costs for which the grant date criteria has been met and the services are expected to be rendered within one year is

and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively). 

(b) Board of Directors 

In 2022, the Company signed agreements with its
four Directors (Cheryl Xu, Paul Field, Charles Allen and Stephen Toovey) which came into effect on July 11, 2023, the date the Company s
IPO Registration Statement was declared effective. Each director is entitled to receive cash compensation of quarterly. In addition,
the non-audit committee chairs (Toovey, Field) will receive per quarter and the audit committee chair (Allen) will receive
an additional per quarter. In addition, each director is entitled to receive annual equity-based compensation awards, with the
amounts and terms to be determined by the Compensation Committee. 

(c) Contingencies 

The Company s operations are subject to
a variety of local and state regulations. Failure to comply with one or more of those regulations could result in fines, restrictions
on its operations, or losses of permits that could result in the Company ceasing operations. 

(d) Contingent Compensation 

Following the Company s IPO and the conversion
of the outstanding debt pursuant to the Knight Debt Conversion Agreement as discussed in Note 7, the Company is obligated to pay Knight
a contingent milestone payment of million if the Company sells Arakoda or if a Change of Control occurs. The Company accounts
for the contingent milestone payment as a derivative liability (See Note 8).

payment of of Net Sales (as defined in the U.S. Army Agreement) for Net Sales less than million, and of Net Sales greater than
 million, with US government sales excluded from the definition of Net Sales. In addition, the Company must pay fees upon the achievement
of certain milestones, including a sales-based milestone fee of once cumulative Net Sales from all sources exceeds million.
The Company accrues the minimum annual royalty when the related sales occur. The Company achieved the sales-based milestone target during
the year ended December 31, 2023, which was paid in full on June 13, 2024. The achievement of other milestones under the U.S. Army Agreement
are not considered probable and thus no accruals for the related milestone payments have been made. 

(e) Litigation, Claims and Assessments 

From time to time, the Company may be involved
in litigation relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, there were no pending

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis is intended
as a review of significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated. The discussion
should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements and the other information set forth in certain of our filings
with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. In addition
to historical information, the following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated
in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed herein and any other periodic reports filed and to be filed
with the SEC. 

Overview 

We are a specialty pharmaceutical company with
a goal of using cutting-edge biological science and applied research to further develop and commercialize new therapies for the prevention
and treatment of infectious diseases. We have successfully achieved regulatory approval of Arakoda Arakoda ), a malaria
preventative treatment that has been on the market since late 2019. Currently, 60P s pipeline under development covers development
programs for vector-borne, fungal, and viral diseases utilizing three of the Company s future products: (i) new products that contain
the Arakoda regimen of Tafenoquine; (ii) new products that contain Tafenoquine; and (iii) Celgosivir. 

Following our initial public offering in July
2023, our initial strategic priority was to conduct a Phase IIB study that would have evaluated the potential of the Arakoda regimen of
Tafenoquine to accelerate disease recovery in COVID-19 patients with low risk of disease progression. In October 2023, we made a decision
to suspend this study. This was a consequence of advice previously received from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which we
interpreted to mean that the Agency would not have granted clearance for the study to proceed unless we redesigned it to (i) enroll a
patient population in which receipt of Paxlovid or Lagevrio would be medically contraindicated, or (ii) compare Tafenoquine to placebo
in patients taking a standard of care regimen (defined by the FDA as Lagevrio or Paxlovid). The FDA s position was
somewhat surprising given that neither Paxlovid nor Lagevrio is indicated for treatment of COVID-19 in low-risk patients. We determined
that conducting our study in an alternate population in the United States would be unfeasible, and that conducting an add-on-to standard
of care study might not be Phase III enabling. Accordingly, we made a decision to pivot back to continue commercialization of Arakoda
for malaria, and further evaluation of the Arakoda regimen of Tafenoquine for babesiosis and other diseases. We believe such an approach
is both less risky and less expensive. 

Moving forward, our general strategy to achieve
profitability and grow shareholder value has three facets: (i) increase sales of Arakoda; (ii) conduct clinical trials to expand the number
of patients who can use Tafenoquine for new indications in the future; and (iii) reposition small molecule therapeutics with good clinical
safety profiles for new indications. 

Business Developments 

The following highlights significant business
developments in our business during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

On July 9, 2024, our expanded use protocol for treatment of babesiosis in immunocompromised patients with persistent babesia microti received IRB (ethics) clearance. 

On July 15, 2024, we entered into clinical trial agreements with Yale University and Rhode Island Hospital for our tafenoquine babesiosis clinical trial in hospitalized patients. 

On July 22, 2024, we converted 1,291 shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by an investor into 40,000 shares of our common stock. On July 26, 2024, we converted an additional 1,032 shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by the investor into 33,334 shares of our common stock. 

31 

On July 24, 2024, we were awarded a fixed-price contract with the United States Army Medical Materiel Development Activity to support commercial validation of new bottle and replacement blister packaging of ARAKODA . This initiative is critical for ensuring the continued procurement by the U.S. government. 

In August 2024, we granted the University of Kentucky a right of reference to our new drug application for ARAKODA . The right of reference will allow the FDA to review clinical efficacy and safety data, non-clinical data and chemistry, manufacturing and control information on ARAKODA as the FDA reviews protocols and new IND application submissions related to the University of Kentucky s investigational SJ733 Phase IIB program. 

At-the-Market Sales Agreement 

On July 12, 2024, we filed a shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-280796) containing a (i) base prospectus covering the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to 15,000,000
of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and units and (ii) sales agreement prospectus Prospectus Supplement covering the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of 1,253,603 (which amount was included in
the 15,000,000 aggregate offering price set forth in the base prospectus) of our common stock that may be issued and sold under the At-The-Market
Issuance Sales Agreement dated as of July 12, 2024 (the ATM Agreement ), that we entered into with WallachBeth Capital LLC,
as sales agent. The Prospectus Supplement was subsequently amended on July 22, 2024, July 24, 2024, July 26, 2024, and August 2, 2024,
to increase the maximum aggregate offering price under the ATM Agreement to 1,774,640, 1,890,705, 2,190,416, and 2,295,192, respectively.
Between July 19, 2024 and August 1, 2024, we sold a total of 677,819 shares pursuant to the ATM Agreement and Prospectus Supplement, as
amended, for gross proceeds of 1,994,583. 

2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders 

On July 16, 2024, we conducted our 2024 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders (the 2024 Annual Meeting ). The stockholders of record at the close of business on May 12, 2024,
the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting, approved the proposals to (1) elect
five directors to serve until the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified;
(2) approve an amendment to the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance by
416,667 shares; (3) approve an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock at a
reverse stock split ratio ranging from 1:5 to 1:12 inclusive, as may be determined at the appropriate time by the Board of Directors,
in its sole discretion; (4) approve the issuance of options granted to a consultant to
comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c); and (5) ratify the selection of RBSM LLP by the Board of Directors as our independent auditor
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. 

Reverse Stock Split and Nasdaq Delisting Notice 

In February 2024, we received a letter from the
Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive
business days, our common stock had not maintained a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share required for continued listing on The
Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Rule ). Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A),
we were provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until August 26, 2024 (the Compliance Period ), to regain compliance
with the Bid Price Rule. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed 1.00 per share for a minimum
of 10 consecutive trading days, unless extended by Nasdaq under Nasdaq Rule 5810(c)(3)(H), prior to August 26, 2024. At the 2024 Annual
Meeting in July 2024, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to effect reverse stock split of our
common stock at a range of ratios between 1:5 to 1:12 inclusive, and on July 19, 2024, our Board of Directors approved the implementation
of the reverse stock split at a ratio of 1:12 (the Reverse Stock Split ). The Reverse Stock Split was effective as of August
12, 2024. 

32 

As of the effective time of the Reverse Stock
Split, every twelve (12) issued and outstanding shares of our common stock was automatically combined and converted into one (1) issued
and outstanding share of common stock, with no change to the par value, reducing the number of shares of common stock outstanding from
21,219,937 shares to 1,768,337 shares. No fractional shares of common stock were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split and
all fractional shares were rounded up to the nearest whole share with respect to outstanding shares of common stock. We issued an additional
93,563 shares of common stock on August 19, 2024 for rounding due to fractional shares. The Reverse Stock Split did not change the authorized
number of shares of common stock or preferred stock. Proportional adjustments were made to the number of shares of common stock issuable
upon exercise or conversion of our equity awards, warrants, and other equity instruments convertible into common stock, as well as the
respective exercise prices, if applicable in accordance with the terms of the instruments. Unless otherwise noted, all references to numbers
of shares of our common stock and per share information presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been retroactively adjusted,
as appropriate, to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. 

On August 26, 2024, we received written notice
from the Listing Qualifications Staff of Nasdaq stating that for the 10 consecutive business day period between August 12, 2024 through
August 23, 2024, the closing bid price of our common stock was at 1.00 per share or greater. Accordingly, we regained compliance with
the Bid Price Rule for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market and the matter was closed. 

Private Placement 

On September 4, 2024, we entered into a Securities
Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor, agreeing to issue and sell in a private placement
offering (the Private Placement (i) pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,898,551 shares of common stock (the September
2024 Pre-Funded Warrants ), (ii) series A warrants to purchase 2,898,551 shares of common stock (the Series A Warrants ),
and (iii) series B warrants to purchase 2,898,551 shares of common stock (the Series B Warrants at a price of 1.379 per
Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying Series A and Series B Warrants. The Private Placement closed on September 5, 2024, generating net
proceeds to us of 3,414,502, after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. 

The September Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise
price of 0.001 per share and are immediately exercisable, subject to certain ownership restrictions, and will remain exercisable until
exercised in full. The Series A and Series B Warrants have an exercise price of 1.38 per share and will be exercisable beginning on the
effective date of stockholder approval to approve the exercise of the Series A and Series B Warrants and the September 2024 Agent Warrants,
defined below, to comply with applicable listing rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market Stockholder Approval ,
and such date that approval is obtained, the Stockholder Approval Date ). The Series A Warrants expire five years after the
Stockholder Approval Date and the Series B Warrants will expire 18 months after the Stockholder Approval Date. 

As compensation for acting as the placement agent
for the Private Placement, we issued to H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC warrants to purchase up to 217,391 shares of stock (the September
2024 Agent Warrants ). The September 2024 Agent Warrants have substantially the same terms as the Series A Warrants, except that
the September 2024 Agent Warrants have an exercise price equal to 1.725 per share. 

The Purchase Agreement requires that we must hold
an annual or special meeting of stockholders within 90 days from the Closing for the purposes of obtaining the Stockholder Approval. If
Stockholder Approval is not obtained, we must call an additional stockholder meeting every six months thereafter until the earlier of
the date such Stockholder Approval is obtained, or the Series A Warrants, the Series B Warrants, and the September 2024 Agent Warrants
are no longer outstanding. 

The September 2024
Pre-Funded Warrants, the Series A Warrants, the Series B Warrants, and the September 2024 Agent Warrants and the shares of our Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
Act ), were not offered pursuant to the Registration Statement and were offered pursuant to the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2)
under the Securities Act and Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder. In connection with the Private Placement, we entered into a registration
rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement with the Purchaser, pursuant to which, among other things, we are required
to prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC one or more registration statements to register
for resale the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Series A Warrants, the Series B Warrants, and the September 2024 Pre-Funded
Warrants (the Warrant Shares ). We are required to use our best efforts to have such registration statement(s) declared effective
as promptly as possible thereafter, and in any event no later than 45 days following September 4, 2024, or, in the event of a full
review by the SEC, 75 days following the date such additional registration statement is required to be filed thereunder.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, our net cash used in operating activities was 4,009,871 and 4,479,242, respectively and the cash balance was 3,300,688 as of
September 30, 2024 2,142,485 as of December 31, 2023). To date, we have funded our operations through debt and equity financings. Based
on current internal projections, taking into consideration the net proceeds of approximately 1.8 million received under the ATM Agreement,
an additional 3.4 million received from the Private Placement, and recent growth in Arakoda sales, we estimate that we will have sufficient
funds to remain viable through June 30, 2025, excluding the additional costs of conducting the expanded access study for chronic babesiosis
patients (currently being planned). We cannot give assurance that we can increase our cash balances or limit our cash consumption and
thus maintain sufficient cash balances for our planned operations or future acquisitions. Future business demands may lead to cash utilization
at levels greater than recently experienced. We may need to raise additional capital in the future. However, we cannot assure you that
we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. 

Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated
deficit of 38,482,920. In their audit report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our auditors have expressed their concern as
to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate cash
flows from operations and obtain financing. 

The audited consolidated financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, included an explanatory note referring to our recurring operating
losses and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated condensed financial
statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of obligations in
the normal course of business. However, we have not demonstrated the ability to generate enough revenues to date to cover operating expenses
and have accumulated losses to date. This condition, among others, raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
for one year from the date these consolidated condensed financial statements are issued. 

In view of these matters, continuation as a going
concern is dependent upon our ability to meet financial requirements, raise additional capital, and achieve gross profitability from our
single marketed product. We plan to fund our operations through third party and related party debt/advances, private placement of restricted
securities and the issuance of stock in a subsequent offering until such a time as we are able to generate profitable operations, or a
business combination may be achieved. 

Our consolidated condensed financial statements
do not include any adjustments to the amount and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to
continue as a going concern.

Amounts related to contingent milestone payments
are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the achievement of certain milestones. These contingent milestones
may or may not be achieved. We have not included any of these amounts in the table above as we cannot estimate or predict when, or if,
these amounts will become due. 

Components of Results of Operations 

Product Revenues - net of Discounts and
Rebates 

To date, we have received the majority of our
product revenues from sales of our Arakoda product to the US Department of Defense (the DoD and resellers in the U.S. and
abroad. Foreign sales to both Australia and Europe are further subject to profit sharing agreements for boxes sold to customers. Currently,
the procurement contract with the DoD has expired and DoD sales last occurred in 2021. Sales to resellers in the US are subject to considerable
discounts and rebates for services provided by our third-party logistics 3PL partner and wholesalers and pharmacy benefit
managers PBMs ). 

Cost of Revenues, Gross Profit (Loss), and
Gross Margin 

Cost of revenues associated with our products
is primarily comprised of direct materials, manufacturing related costs incurred in the production process and inventory write-downs due
to expiration. 

Other Operating Revenues 

Other operating revenues for the periods presented
primarily consist of research revenue earned from the Australian Tax Authority for research activities conducted in Australia. Beginning
in the third quarter of 2024, we began to recognize research revenues associated with the new contract with the United States Army Medical
Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) for Arakoda supply chain upgrade support. Research revenue under this contract is recognized when
we incur the direct costs eligible for reimbursement, up to the maximum allowable amount. 

Operating Expenses 

Research and Development 

Research and development costs for the periods
presented primarily consist of contracted R D services and costs associated with preparation for our Babesiosis trial in 2024 and,
in 2023 related to our now halted COVID-19 clinical trial. We expense all research and development costs in the period in which they are
incurred. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are recognized as prepaid assets
and expensed over the service period as the services are provided. We have also issued shares of our common stock in exchange for research
and development services. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

Our general and administrative expenses primarily
consist of salaries, advertising and promotion expenses, professional services fees, such as consulting, audit, accounting and legal fees,
general corporate costs and allocated costs, including facilities, information technology and amortization of intangibles. 

Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net 

Interest expense consists of interest accrued
on our debt obligations and related amortization of debt discounts and deferred issuance costs. Other components of other income (expense),
net include changes in the fair value of financial instruments, gains and losses on extinguishments of debt, and other miscellaneous income
(expense). We also earn interest income from cash invested in interest-bearing accounts as well as cash equivalents and short-term investments
consisting of certificates of deposits with original maturities ranging from three to six months.

Product Revenues - net of Discounts and Rebates 

Our product revenues - net of discounts and rebates
were 135,293 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 51,188 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our U.S. pharmaceutical distributor accounted for 92 of our total net product sales and Kodatef
sales to our Australian distributor accounted for 8 of total net product sales (100 and 0 for the three months ended September 30,
2023, respectively). Domestic, commercial product sales are primarily driving increased sales volume during the period. 

We offer discounts and rebates to the civilian
U.S. supply chain distribution channel. We record sales when our 3PL partner transfers boxes into their title model. Discounts and rebates
offered to our 3PL partner amount to 12 along with a 5,500 fixed monthly fee that started in 2023. The product is then transferred usually
to one of the three large U.S. pharmaceutical distributors where rebates are 10 . Lastly, we have relationships with several large PBMs
that allow patients to purchase Arakoda at a discount. The rebate associated with PBMs ranges from 30 to 41.25 depending on the amount
of coverage provided. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, discounts and rebates were 122,862 compared to 76,441 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Arakoda entered the U.S. civilian supply chain
in the third quarter of 2019. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, 550 boxes were sold to pharmacies and dispensaries. Sales
volume increased by 140 to 1,319 boxes sold to pharmacies and dispensaries for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Based on IQVIA
data, this growth in sales volume appears to be driven primarily by organic growth in the Lyme disease community, whose prescribers utilize
Arakoda for treatment of babesiosis. The sales volume growth to pharmacies and dispensaries ties more closely to the growth in discounts
and rebates previously discussed than our reported sales to our 3PL. 

Kodatef sales to our distributor Biocelect in
Australia for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 10,691 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023). Sales to Biocelect
are currently subject to a profit share distribution once the original transfer price has been recouped. The most recent sale of boxes
to Biocelect reached profit share at the end of Q1 2024. Biocelect reported approximately 130 year-over-year growth for the quarter,
the equivalent of 414 boxes sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 184 boxes for the three months ended September
30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Biocelect s unsold inventory that remains subject to profit share was the equivalent of 726
boxes. While growth in Australia is similarly positive to that in the US, Biocelect has achieved that growth by competing directly with
Malarone in terms of price in their market for the approved antimalarial prophylaxis indication. As of September 30, 2024, 11,037 of
profit share was due to us 0 as of December 31, 2023). 

Arakoda sales volume is also showing signs of
sales growth in Europe. We first shipped Arakoda to our distributor Scandinavian Biopharma SB in September 2022. For the
three months ended September 30, 2024, SB reported 54 boxes sold (none the three months ended September 30, 2023). According to our distributor
this is due to greater interest in treating babesiosis. 

Cost of Revenues, Gross Profit (Loss), and
Gross Margin 

Cost of revenues was 111,687 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 71,196 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of goods sold is
primarily driven by the increase in net product sales over the same periods. Despite the increase, the Gross Margin increased significantly
from (39.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 17.45 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This is primarily
attributable to the fixed part of cost of goods. As the sales volume has increased, the gross margin has improved as the variable cost
of goods of each unit sold is substantially less than the sales price.

Research and Development 

Research and development costs increased during
the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Research and development costs incurred
during the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of initiation costs related to our Phase IIB COVID-19 clinical trial, which
was later suspended in the fourth quarter of 2023. Direct COVID-19-related trial costs represented 82 of the costs for the three months
ended September 30, 2023 at 216,567 (less than 1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 at 5,445). During the three months ended
September 30, 2024, we recorded research and development expense of 600,000, representing 64 of the total costs, upon the delivery from
Trevally of 8.8 kilograms of castanospermine. In January 2023, we issued Trevally 10,000 fully vested shares of our common stock as advance
consideration for the services, which payment was deferred and capitalized until delivery of the completed research materials. We also
incurred 270,497 in costs related to our babesiosis trial for tafenoquine during the three months ended September 30, 2024 0 during
the three months ended September 30, 2023). 

General and Administrative Expenses 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
our general and administrative expenses decreased by 7.5 or 98,564 from the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three
months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded higher compensation expenses due to accruals for performance bonuses payable to our executives,
as well as higher salaries and benefits expense due to hiring a new Chief Commercial Officer in February 2024 at 171,948 and 171,353,
respectively (compared to 0 and 123,672 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively). However, the main driver of the
decrease relates to stock-based compensation, which decreased from 458,266 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 15,246 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of certain options and restricted stock units granted to our directors and executives
on the closing date of our IPO in July 2023, some of which were fully vested and thus immediately expensed on the IPO date.

Interest Expense 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we recognized 1,467 of interest expense 40,106 for the three months ended September 30, 2023). The decrease in interest expense is
the result of the settlement or conversion of a majority of our outstanding debt obligations upon the closing of our IPO in July 2023.
Cash paid for interest was 2,193 and 171,807 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

39 

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we recognized a loss on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of 56,712 compared to a gain of 92,490 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, derivative liabilities include the contingent milestone payment
due to Knight upon a future sale of Arakoda or a Change of Control. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, derivative liabilities
consisted of bridge shares, certain warrants, and embedded conversion features in our convertible notes. We use a probability-weighted
discounted cash flow model or a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of these instruments. 

Loss on Debt Extinguishment 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023,
we recognized a 391,593 net loss on debt extinguishment (none for the three months ended September 30, 2024). The decrease is related,
in part, to a total 614,670 loss recognized upon extinguishment of our interim bridge financing notes, all of which were settled or converted
upon our IPO in July 2023. The net amount for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was partially offset by a debt extinguishment
gain of 223,077 recognized on conversion of the Xu Yu promissory note on the date of our IPO. There were no debt extinguishments recognized
during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Change in Fair Value of Promissory Note 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023,
we recognized a 6,105,066 gain related to the change in the fair value of the promissory note with Knight, which was held at fair value.
The gain relates to the mark to market adjustment recognized immediately prior to the automatic conversion of the outstanding debt obligation
into our equity shares upon the closing of our IPO. We no longer have any debt obligations measured at fair value on a recurring basis,
hence we recorded a 0 change in fair value for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Other Income (Expense), net 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we recognized 16,623 in other income compared to 70,490 in other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a result
of the IPO and recent equity offerings completed in 2024, we now earn interest income as we have invested certain cash proceeds in interest-bearing
accounts and short-term certificates of deposit. We recognized interest income of 16,635 during the three months ended September 30,
2024 0 during the three months ended September 30, 2023).

We offer discounts and rebates to the civilian
U.S. supply chain distribution channel. We record sales when our 3PL partner transfers boxes into their title model. Discounts and rebates
offered to our 3PL partner amount to 12 along with a 5,500 fixed monthly fee that started in 2023. The product is then transferred usually
to one of the three large U.S. pharmaceutical distributors where rebates are 10 . Lastly, we have relationships with several large PBMs
that allow patients to purchase Arakoda at a discount. The rebate associated with PBMs ranges from 30 to 41.25 depending on the amount
of coverage provided. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, discounts and rebates were 324,486 compared to 124,090 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Arakoda entered the U.S. civilian supply chain
in the third quarter of 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 1,059 boxes were sold to pharmacies and dispensaries. Sales
volume increased by 244 to 3,642 boxes sold to pharmacies and dispensaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Based on IQVIA
data, this growth in sales volume appears to be driven primarily by organic growth in the Lyme disease community, whose prescribers utilize
Arakoda for treatment of babesiosis. The sales volume growth to pharmacies and dispensaries ties more closely to the growth in discounts
and rebates previously discussed than our reported sales to our 3PL. 

Kodatef sales to our distributor Biocelect in
Australia for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 20,697 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023). Sales to Biocelect
are currently subject to a profit share distribution once the original transfer price has been recouped. The most recent sale of boxes
to Biocelect reached profit share at the end of Q1 2024. Biocelect reported 279 year-over-year growth, the equivalent of 1,489 boxes
sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 393 boxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September
30, 2024, Biocelect s unsold inventory that remains subject to profit share was the equivalent of 726 boxes. While growth in Australia
is similarly positive to that in the US, Biocelect has achieved that growth by competing directly with Malarone in terms of price in their
market for the approved antimalarial prophylaxis indication. As of September 30, 2024, 11,037 of profit share was due to us 0 as of
December 31, 2023). 

Arakoda sales volume is also showing signs of
increase in Europe. We first shipped Arakoda to our distributor Scandinavian Biopharma in September 2022. For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, they reported 109 boxes sold (none the nine months ended September 30, 2023). According to our distributor this is due to greater
interest in treating babesiosis. 

Service Revenues 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we recognized 10,789 in service revenue in association with the final payment from the USAMMDA for storing Arakoda purchases 0 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023). The revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is related to the final resolution
of storage fees payable from the USAMMDA under the original development contract entered into in 2014. As the development contract ended
on August 31, 2022, additional storage revenue is not expected in the near future. 

Cost of Revenues, Gross Profit (Loss), and
Gross Margin 

Cost of revenues was 266,688 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 328,293 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. While net product sales increased over
the same periods, the decrease in cost of goods sold is primarily attributable to the fixed part of cost of goods. As the sales volume
has increased, the gross margin has improved as the variable cost of goods of each unit sold is substantially less than the sales price.
Additionally, write-downs for expired inventory were significantly higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 at 94,977,
as compared to 18,490 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Due to these factors, the Gross Margin increased significantly
from (156.70 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 29.21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Research and Development 

Research and development costs increased during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Research and development costs incurred
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of initiation costs related to our Phase IIB COVID-19 clinical trial, which
was later suspended in the fourth quarter of 2023. Direct COVID-19-related trial costs represent less than 1 of the total costs for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 at 25,817 and 85 of the costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 at 504,711. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded research and development expense of 3,225,000, representing 74 of the total costs,
related to share-based payments issued to vendors in January 2023 as advance consideration, which payments were initially deferred and
capitalized. Kentucky Technology, Inc. delivered us a report on the potential development of SJ733 + tafenoquine in the second quarter
of 2024 and Trevally completed the synthesis of 8.8 kilograms of castanospermine in the third quarter of 2024, resulting in 2,625,000
and 600,000, respectively, of research and development expense recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We also incurred
 846,323 in costs related to our babesiosis trial for tafenoquine during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 0 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2023). 

General and Administrative Expenses 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
our general and administrative expenses increased by 34.03 or 868,321 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded higher compensation expenses due to accruals for performance bonuses payable to our executives,
as well as higher salaries and benefits expense due to hiring a new Chief Commercial Officer in February 2024 at 171,948 and 498,832,
respectively (compared to 0 and 200,068 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively). Additionally, during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 316,311 in legal and professional fees, 422,702 of insurance expenses, 684,808 of investor outreach
expenses, and 226,024 of advertising and promotion expenses (up from 172,690, 164,361, 417,620 and 64,280 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, respectively). These increases were partially offset by a significant decrease in stock-based compensation, which
decreased from 458,266 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 15,246 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result
of certain options and restricted stock units granted to our directors and executives on the closing date of our IPO in July 2023, some
of which were fully vested and thus immediately expensed on the IPO date.

Interest Expense 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we recognized 6,490 of interest expense 2,281,191 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023). The decrease in interest expense is
the result of the settlement or conversion of a majority of our outstanding debt obligations upon the closing of our IPO in July 2023.
Cash paid for interest expense was 6,579 and 176,924 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Derivative Expense 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
we recognized 399,725 of derivative expense in connection with the raising of 555,000 in net proceeds from our bridge funding in May
2023. We record derivative expense when the initial fair value of the related derivative liabilities exceeds the cash proceeds received.
We did not record derivative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as we did not complete any debt financing transactions
during the period. 

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we recognized a gain on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of 1,683,034 compared to a gain of 95,324 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, derivative liabilities include the contingent milestone payment
due to Knight upon a future sale of Arakoda or a Change of Control. The fair value of the contingent milestone payment is inversely related
to the net present value of future investments in the Company and anticipated timing to profitability within our budget models. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, derivative liabilities consisted of bridge shares, certain warrants, and embedded conversion features
in our convertible notes. We use a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model or a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair
value of these instruments. 

Loss on Debt Extinguishment 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we did not recognize a gain or loss on debt extinguishment 1,231,480 loss recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023).
The decrease is related, in part to the conversion of the cumulative outstanding debt pursuant to the Knight Debt Conversion Agreement
in January 2023, which was accounted for as a debt extinguishment, as well as losses recognized upon extinguishment of our interim bridge
financing notes, all of which were settled or converted upon our IPO in July 2023. The net amount for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 was partially offset by a debt extinguishment gain of 223,077 recognized on conversion of the Xu Yu promissory note on the date
of our IPO. 

Change in Fair Value of Promissory Note 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
we recognized a 5,379,269 gain related to the change in fair value of the Convertible Knight Loan, which was held at fair value beginning
on the modification date in January 2023. The gain relates to the mark to market adjustment recognized immediately prior to the automatic
conversion of the outstanding debt obligation into our equity shares upon the closing of our IPO. We no longer have any debt obligations
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, hence we recorded a 0 change in fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Other Income (Expense), net 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we recognized 56,569 in other income compared to 69,169 in other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a result of
the IPO and recent equity offerings completed in 2024, we now earn interest income as we have invested certain cash proceeds in interest-bearing
accounts and short-term certificates of deposit. We recognized interest income of 59,192 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023). Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 48,236 was recognized
in other expense due to a one-time write off of an uncollectible receivable from our 3PL for an uninvoiced return.

Cash Used in Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was 4,009,871
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4,479,242 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net cash used
in operating activities increased, primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses at 3,419,747 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 2,551,426 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023), primarily due to higher compensation and related expenses,
legal and professional fees, insurance expenses, investor outreach expenses, and advertising and promotion expenses, as discussed above.
In addition, we incurred 846,323 in costs related to our planned babesiosis trial for tafenoquine during the nine months ended September
30, 2024 0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023). 

Cash Used in Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was 1,887,016
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 49,326 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash
used in investing activities is primarily driven by purchases of short-term certificates of deposit for a total cost of 1,708,000 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023) for the purposes of earning interest income.
Additionally, purchases of computer and lab equipment totaled 103,773 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 1,823 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023), and capitalized website development costs and patent costs totaled 25,374 and 49,869, respectively,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 18,283 and 29,220 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively). 

Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was
 7,052,598 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6,474,565 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase
in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to net proceeds of (i) 1,914,513 received for the sale of common
stock and warrants in January 2024, (ii) 1,790,670 from the sale of common stock pursuant to the At-the-Market Sales Agreement in July
and August 2024, and (iii) 3,439,502 received from the sale of warrants in our Private Placement offering that closed in September 2024,
in each case partially offset by payment of deferred offering costs. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 related to net proceeds of 6,454,325 generated from our IPO, which closed on July 14, 2023, as well as 1,131,771 received from
the exercise of warrants, but partially offset by repayments of certain of our outstanding debt obligations in July 2023. 

Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash 

Our foreign operations were small relative to
U.S. operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, thus effects of foreign exchange rate changes on cash have been
minor.

Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments,
and Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Revenue Recognition 

We receive revenues from sales of our Arakoda
product to the DoD and resellers in the U.S. and abroad. We record deferred revenues for any advances and then recognize revenue upon
shipment to the retailer who orders product for a specific customer. We record a receivable for any amounts to be received pursuant to
such sales. We record revenues from product sales at the net sales price, or transaction price, which may include estimates
of variable consideration that result from anticipated product returns, generally based on historical return data. 

Inventory 

We report inventories at the lower of cost or
net realizable value. Cost is comprised of direct materials and, where applicable, costs we incur in bringing the inventories to their
present location and condition. We use the Specific Identification method per lot. A box price is calculated per lot number and sales
are recognized by their lot number. 

We regularly monitor our inventory levels to identify
inventory that may expire or has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, and record write-downs for inventory that has
expired, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value, and inventory in excess of expected sales requirements.
We charge any write-downs of inventories to Cost of Revenues in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
(Loss) Income. 

Share-Based Payments 

We measure compensation for all share-based payment
awards granted to employees, directors, and nonemployees, based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. For awards
that vest based on continued service, the service-based compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period, which is generally the vesting period of the awards. For service vesting awards with compensation expense recognized on a straight-line
basis, at no point in time does the cumulative grant date value of vested awards exceed the cumulative amount of compensation expense
recognized. The grant date is determined based on the date when a mutual understanding of the key terms of the share-based awards is established.
We account for forfeitures as they occur. 

We estimate the fair value of all stock option
awards as of the grant date by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions,
including the fair value of the common stock, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends and the expected term of
the option. Due to the lack of a public market for our common stock prior to the IPO and lack of company-specific historical implied volatility
data, we base our computations of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with
similar characteristics of the Company, including stage of development and industry focus. The historical volatility is calculated based
on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. We use the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin Topic 14, Share-Based Payment , to calculate the expected term for stock options, whereby, the expected term equals the
midpoint of the weighted average remaining time to vest, vesting period and the contractual term of the options due to our lack of historical
exercise data. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity date commensurate with the expected term
of the associated award. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to
pay any dividends on our common stock. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates
and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment. 

45 

We recognize compensation expense for restricted
stock units RSUs with only service-based vesting conditions on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Compensation
cost for service-based RSUs is based on the grant date fair value of the award, which is the closing market price of our common stock
on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares awarded. 

For awards that vest upon a liquidity event or
a change in control, the performance condition is not probable of being achieved until the event occurs. As a result, no compensation
expense is recognized until the performance-based vesting condition is achieved, at which time the cumulative compensation expense is
recognized. Compensation cost related to any remaining time-based service for share-based awards after the liquidity-based event is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the remaining service period. 

For fully vested, nonforfeitable equity instruments
that are granted at the date we enter into an agreement for goods or services with a nonemployee, we recognize the fair value of the equity
instruments on the grant date. The corresponding cost is recognized as an immediate expense or a prepaid asset and expensed over the service
period depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the agreement with the nonemployee. 

Derivative Liabilities 

We assess the classification of our derivative
financial instruments each reporting period, which formerly consisted of bridge shares, convertible notes payable, and certain warrants,
and determined that such instruments qualified for treatment as derivative liabilities as they met the criteria for liability classification
under ASC 815 (excluding certain warrants issued in connection with the IPO). As of September 30, 2024, our derivative financial instruments
consist of contingent payment arrangements. 

We analyze all financial instruments with features
of both liabilities and equity under the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic No. 480, ASC 480 ), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and FASB ASC Topic No. 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). Derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting period, with any increase or decrease
in the fair value recorded in the results of operations (other income/expense) as change in fair value of derivative liabilities. We use
a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of these instruments. 

Upon conversion or repayment of a debt or equity
instrument in exchange for equity shares, where the embedded conversion option has been bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative liability
(generally convertible debt and warrants), we record the equity shares at fair value on the date of conversion, relieve all related debt,
derivative liabilities, and unamortized debt discounts, and recognize a net gain or loss on debt extinguishment, if any. 

Equity or liability instruments that become subject
to reclassification under ASC Topic 815 are reclassified at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

During 2024 and 2023, we did not have any relationships
with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been
established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

JOBS Act Accounting Election 

In April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section
107(b) of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can
delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to
avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public
companies that are not emerging growth companies.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of
the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and
therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over our financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management has used the framework
set forth in the report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that assessment, our
management has identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 

Our management concluded that as of September
30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, and that material weaknesses existed in the following areas
as of September 30, 2024: 

(1) we
do not employ full time in-house personnel with the technical knowledge to identify and address some of the reporting issues surrounding
certain complex or non-routine transactions. With respect to material, complex and non-routine transactions, management has and will
continue to seek guidance from third-party experts and/or consultants to gain a thorough understanding of these transactions 

(2) we
have inadequate segregation of duties consistent with the control objectives including but not limited to the disbursement process, transaction
or account changes, and the performance of account reconciliations and approval and 

(3) we
have ineffective controls over the period end financial disclosure and reporting process caused by insufficient accounting staff. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

47 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEDINGS 

From time to time, claims are made against us
in the ordinary course of business, which could result in litigation. Claims and associated litigation are subject to inherent uncertainties
and unfavorable outcomes could occur, such as monetary damages, fines, penalties or injunctions prohibiting us from selling one or more
products or engaging in other activities. There were no reportable litigation events during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

As a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule
12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and in item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting
obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this item. In any event, there have been no material
changes in our risk factors as previously disclosed in the Registration Statement. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

On July 22, 2024, we issued 40,000 restricted
shares of our common stock to Knight Therapeutics International S.A. (formerly known as Knight Therapeutics (Barbados) Inc.) Knight upon conversion of 1,291 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 

On July 26, 2024, we issued 33,334 restricted
shares of our common stock to Knight upon conversion of 1,032 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 

The issuances of shares of common stock listed
above were deemed exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D promulgated thereunder in that
the issuance of securities did not involve a public offering. 

Securities Purchase Agreement 

On September 4, 2024, we entered into a Securities
Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor (the Purchaser ), pursuant to which
the Company agreed to issue and sell in a private placement offering (the Private Placement (i) an aggregate of 2,898,551
pre-funded warrants (the Pre-funded Warrants ), each having the right to purchase one share of common stock, par value 0.0001
per share (the Common Stock ), at a price per Pre-funded Warrant equal to 1.379, the per share Purchase Price (as defined
in the Purchase Agreement) less 0.001, the exercise price of the Pre-funded Warrants, (ii) series A warrants to purchase up to 2,898,551
shares of Common Stock Series A Warrants and series B warrants to purchase up to 2,898,551 shares of Common Stock Series
B Warrants and, collectively with Series A Warrants, the Common Warrants for gross proceeds of approximately 4
million, before the deduction of placement agent fees and offering expenses. The closing of the Private Placement occurred on September
5, 2024. 

The Pre-funded Warrants were sold, at the Purchaser s
election, to such Purchaser whose purchase of shares of Common Stock in the Private Placement would otherwise result in such Purchaser,
together with its affiliates and certain related parties, beneficially own more than 4.99 (or, at such Purchaser s option upon
issuance 9.99 of the Company s outstanding Common Stock immediately following the consummation of the Private Placement. The Pre-Funded
Warrants have an exercise price of 0.001 per share, will become exercisable upon issuance and remain exercisable until exercised in full. 

The Common Warrants have an exercise price of
 1.38 per share and will be exercisable beginning on the effective date of stockholder approval of the issuance of the shares of common
stock upon exercise of the Common Warrants, which is November 6, 2024 (the Stockholder Approval ). The Series A Warrants
will expire five years from Stockholder Approval and the Series B Warrants will expire eighteen (18) months from Stockholder Approval. 

A holder of a Common Warrant or Pre-funded Warrant
will not have the right to exercise any portion of its warrants if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in
excess of 4.99 (or 9.99 at the election of the holder prior to the date of issuance) of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after giving effect to such exercise (the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provided, however, that upon sixty
(60) days prior notice to the Company, the holder may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, provided that in
no event shall the Beneficial Ownership Limitation exceed 9.99 .

H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Placement Agent acted as the exclusive placement agent in connection with the Private Placement under an engagement
letter, dated August 30, 2024, as amended, between the Company and the Placement Agent (the Engagement Letter ).
Pursuant to the Engagement Letter, the Company agreed to pay the Placement Agent a cash fee equal to 7.5 of the aggregate gross
proceed of the Private Placement and a management fee of 1.0 of the aggregate gross exercise price paid in cash with respect
thereto. The Company also agreed to pay the Placement Agent 85,000 for non-accountable expenses. The Company also issued to
Wainwright (or its designees) warrants (the Placement Agent Warrants to purchase up to 217,391 shares of Common. The
Placement Agent Warrants have an exercise price equal to 1.725 per share and are exercisable beginning on the effective date of the
Stockholder Approval for five years from Stockholder Approval. 

The Pre-Funded Warrants, Common Warrants and Placement
Agent Warrants and the shares of our Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants, Common Warrants and Placement
Agent Warrants have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), were not offered
pursuant to the Registration Statement and were offered pursuant to the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act
and Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder. 

The Company agreed to indemnify the Placement
Agent against certain liabilities relating to or arising out of the Placement Agent s activities under the Engagement Letter and
to contribute to payments that the Placement Agent may be required to make in respect of such liabilities. 

The Company currently intends to use the proceeds
from the Private Placement of approximately 4.0 million in gross proceeds, before deducting the placement agent s fees and other
offering expenses payable by the Company, and excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants and Common
Warrants, for working capital, general operations, commercialization activities related to Arakoda, and the Company s research and
development program. 

Based in part upon the representations of the
Purchaser in the Securities Purchase Agreement, the offering and sale of the securities issued in the Private Placement is exempt from
registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), Rule 506 of Regulation
D promulgated under the Securities Act and corresponding provisions of state securities or blue sky laws. 

Registration Right Agreement 

In connection with the Private Placement, the
Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement with the Purchaser, pursuant to
which, among other things, the Company is required to prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC one or more registration statements to register for resale the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Common Warrants and
the Pre-Funded Warrants (the Warrant Shares ). The Company is required to use best efforts to have such registration statement(s)
(collectively, the Registration Statement declared effective as promptly as possible thereafter, and in any event no later
than 45 days following September 4, 2024, or, in the event of a full review by the SEC, 75 days following the date such
additional Registration Statement is required to be filed hereunder. 

Subsequently, the Company filed a registration
statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-282221) on September 19, 2024, which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission
on September 30, 2024 (the Registration Statement ). The Registration Statement covered the resale of shares of common stock
underlying the Pre-Funded Warrants, Common Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants.

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 

Securities Trading Plans 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
none of our Section 16 officers or directors (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) or any contract, instruction
or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c)
of the Exchange Act or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Section 408(c) of Regulation S-K). 

Subsequent Events 

On October 1, 2024, we issued 206,551 shares of our common stock upon the exercise of 206,551 Pre-Funded Warrants issued September 2024, for aggregate cash proceeds of 207. 

On October 31, 2024, we issued 229,000 shares of our common stock upon the exercise of 229,000 Pre-Funded Warrants issued September 2024, for aggregate cash proceeds of 229. 

On November 6, 2024, we conducted a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the Meeting ). Our stockholders of record at the close of business on September 20, 2024, the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the Meeting, approved the proposals to (1) approve the exercise of the Series A Warrants, the Series B Warrants, and the September 2024 Agent Warrants (each as defined in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements) to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,014,493 shares of our common stock under applicable rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, (2) approve an amendment to the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance by 500,000 shares, and (3) approve an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock at a reverse stock split ratio ranging from 1:3 to 1:5 inclusive, as may be determined at the appropriate time by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion. 

In early November 2024, we received research and development updates in relation to three projects funded by the Company. North Carolina State University provided preliminary PCR testing data from patients with chronic fatigue symptoms and neurological problems. The data will be submitted for publication but is consistent with the prevalence of chronic babesiosis patients being substantially higher than the 10-year addressable market of 350,000 previously reported by the Company. North Carolina State University reported that enrollment in the canine babesiosis program had reached 50 , but no data was available yet. Monash University reported preliminary cell culture and animal data for the tafenoquine-Candida project. The data will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal but does not currently support moving forward with a clinical program focused on development of a parenteral formulation of tafenoquine for candidiasis. 

On November 12, 2024, our Board approved a one-off cash payment of 20,000 to each of the non-executive Directors in lieu of forfeiting the grant of restricted stock units that would have otherwise been granted for the second half of 2024. 

As of November 14, 2024, clinical trial NCT06207370 (evaluation of tafenoquine v placebo in patients hospitalized with severe babesiosis) had enrolled 6 of the minimum 24 patients required to trigger an interim analysis. We expect to complete enrollment prior to September 30, 2025. We have not yet enrolled patients in NCT06478641 (expanded access trial of tafenoquine in high-risk patients with persistent relapsing babesiosis). Trial NCT06656351 (Phase 2 study of tafenoquine for chronic babesiosis) has received comments from the FDA, an ethics committee, and an advisory board of prominent physicians familiar with chronic babesiosis.
