 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q ), including, without limitation, statements under the headings Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about the financial condition, results of operations, earnings outlook and prospects of American Oncology Network, Inc. AON , New AON , AON Inc. , or the Company ). Any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, outlook, estimate, forecast, project, continue, could, may, might, possible, potential, predict, should, would and other similar words and expressions, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. The forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and various assumptions. AON cannot guarantee that it will actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in its forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on AON s forward-looking statements. 
 
 These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond the control of AON), or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are also subject generally to other risks and uncertainties that are described from time to time in AON s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Risk Factors in the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. The risks described in the Risk Factors sections are not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all such risk factors, nor can AON assess the impact of all such risk factors on the business of AON, or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. The statements made herein are made as of the date of this Quarterly Report and, except as may be required by law, AON undertakes no obligation to update them, whether as a result of new information, developments, or otherwise.

 AON LLC Common Units held by New AON - 
 AON LLC Series A Preferred Units held by New AON - 
 
 Class A Common Stock held by the former AON LLC Class B-1 unit holders -

Table of Contents 

 thereafter, the DTOC Sponsor agreed to subject , or shares of New AON Class A common stock held by it as of the Closing (the Sponsor Earnout Shares to the following vesting and forfeiture provisions: 
 
 the Sponsor Earnout Shares will vest when the volume-weighted average price of the New AON Class A common stock equals or exceeds per share for any trading days within any trading day period beginning after the Closing and ending months following the Closing; 
 
 the Sponsor Earnout Shares will be released immediately upon the consummation of a change of control transaction within the -month period following the Closing; and 
 
 if the Sponsor Earnout Shares are not released pursuant to the foregoing provisions on or before the date that is months after the Closing, then the Sponsor Earnout Shares will be forfeited immediately following such date. 
 
 As the Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, the issuance of the Sponsor Earnout Shares to the Company s existing shareholders will be accounted for as an equity transaction. The accounting for the Sponsor Earnout Shares was evaluated under ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , and ASC Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity , to determine if the Sponsor Earnout Shares should be classified as a liability or within equity. As part of that analysis, it was determined that the Sponsor Earnout Shares are freestanding, do not meet the criteria within ASC 480 to be classified as a liability, and meet the criteria in ASC 815-40 to be considered indexed to the post-combination entity s common stock and classified within equity. 
 
 Warrants

 Class B Prefunded Warrants 
 
 As of the Closing Date, New AON issued of Class B Prefunded Warrants to former AON Class A-1 unitholders. Because the Class B Warrants are prefunded, there was not any cash consideration exchanged as part of the Class B Warrant issuance. Each Class B Prefunded Warrant entitles the holder to purchase share of New AON Class B common stock at a price of per share. The exercise term of the Class B Warrant shall continue indefinitely so long as the holder of the Class B Warrant is also the holder of an AON LLC Common Unit, provided that the number of shares of Common Stock that this Warrant is exercisable for shall not exceed the number of AON LLC Common Units held by holder.

 The Company has a system and estimation process for recording Medicare net patient service revenue and estimated recoupments as it relates to value-based care VBC revenue included in patient service revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (income) loss. The Company s VBC revenue is primarily generated through its participation in the CMS Oncology Care Model OCM which is an episode-based payment model to promote high-quality cancer care. Participants enter six-month episode periods, and the Company bills a monthly fee during the six-month period based on a fixed rate per participant per month and the total number of participants. Certain quality and compliance metrics are tracked as part of the program and submitted to CMS at the end of the episode period which may result in recoupment of funds. The Company estimates the recoupment amount by developing a recoupment percentage for each period based on historical known recoupment from CMS and applies the recoupment percentage against total fees for the period. Based on the estimate, the Company accrues a liability representing the expected final recoupments based on historical settlement trends.

This method employs various assumptions such as discount rates, forecasted revenues and growth rates. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 fair value measurements. 
 
 The purchase price allocations are subject to further change when additional information is obtained. The Company intends to finalize the purchase price allocations as soon as practicable within the measurement period, but in no event later than one year following the respective closing date of the acquisitions referenced above.

 AON LLC had authorized units of Class A-1 Units, of which units were issued and were outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Class B Units (Profit Interest) 
 
 The Class B units were issued through the 2017 Profits Interest Plan adopted by the Company in October 2017. The Class B Units represented a non-voting equity interest in AON LLC that entitled the holder to appreciation in the equity value of AON LLC arising after the date of grant and after such time as an applicable hurdle amount is met. AON LLC recognized the cost of services received in exchange for Class B Units based on the grant-date fair value. That cost was recognized over the period during which the service provider is required to provide service in exchange for the award over the requisite service period or based on performance. AON LLC used the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model to estimate the fair value of profits interest unit awards. On an as converted basis, as of December 31, 2022, AON LLC issued Class B Units, of which were vested and outstanding; the remaining of Class B units vested upon consummation of the Business Combination.

 Mezzanine Equity Class C Units 
 
 As described in Note 1, the AON LLC Class C Units were converted into AON LLC Series A Preferred Units as of the Closing Date. Concurrently, New AON issued a number of shares of New AON Series A Preferred Stock equal to the number of AON LLC Series A Preferred Units held by the AON Class C Preferred Investor to AEA Growth Management LP, the parent of AON Class C Preferred Investor AEA Growth in exchange for all the shares of common stock held by AEA Growth in the AON Class C Preferred Investor. Promptly after the First Step, the AON Class C Preferred Investor merged with and into New AON whereby the separate existence of the AON Class C Preferred Investor ceased and New AON held all the AON LLC Series A Preferred Units. On an as converted basis, as of September 20, 2023, Series A Preferred Stock were issued to AEA Growth Management LP . 
 
 The AON LLC Class C Units were contingently redeemable convertible preferred units and classified as mezzanine equity on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023 because the units were redeemable from the issuance date, at the option of the holder. As of June 30, 2023, the AON LLC Class C Units were recorded at their initial carrying value, net of offering costs. The Class C Units were not being accreted to redemption value, as the redemption was not probable due to the removal of the redemption right pursuant to the Business Combination. See discussion below. 
 
 The Class C Units had materially the same rights as the Series A Preferred Stock issued by the Company to AEA Growth Management LP, the parent of the AON Class C Preferred Investor, with the exception of the AON LLC Class C Unit Redemption Right and the Class C Option to Purchase Additional Shares , discussed below. Further, the Class C Units did not contain a mandatory conversion feature that allowed AON LLC to force the Class C Investor to convert the Class C Units into another equity unit in AON LLC and the Class C Units did not have a one time conversion price adjustment. 
 
 Class C Unit Redemption Right 
 
 After the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date (June 7, 2028), the holders of a majority of the Class C Units had the right to cause the Company to redeem all of the Class C Units. The redemption price per Class C Unit was equal to the greater of (i) the Class C Liquidation Preference and (ii) the Fair Market Value of a Class C Unit (the Class C Redemption Price ). The Class C Liquidation Preference is defined as an amount equal to the sum of (a) the Class C Preferred Return of such Class C Member and (b) the amount of such Class C Member s Net Invested Capital Contributions of million. The Class C Unit Preferred Return is defined as the cumulative, semiannually-compounded return of per annum based on the original Net Invested Capital Contributions of million. The Class C Unit Redemption Right was removed as of the Closing of the Business Combination. 
 
 Class C Unit Option to Purchase Additional Units 
 
 In accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated Class C Convertible Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement dated June 7, 2023, the Class C Preferred Investor had an option to purchase an additional AON Class C Units until the Closing of the Business Combination at a purchase price of per Unit Option Feature ). The Company determined that this Option Feature was required to be accounted for as a derivative in accordance with ASC 815. The fair value of the derivative was estimated to be million as of June 30, 2023. 
 
 Series A Preferred Stock (Mezzanine Equity) 
 
 New AON Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable for cash or the value of the property, rights or securities to be paid or distributed in the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event (which outside of the Company s control). As a result, the Company has determined that the New AON Series A Preferred Stock should be classified as mezzanine equity . At the closing of the Business Combination, the Company exchanged existing AON LLC Class C Units for Series A Preferred Stock in the Company. Based on the qualitative changes to the instrument, this exchange is considered an extinguishment for accounting purposes, with the Company recording a deemed dividend of million to account for the difference between the carrying value of the Class C Units and the fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock at the transaction date. This amount is reflected in the December 31, 2023 condensed

 per annum based on the original Net Invested Capital Contributions from the Class C Units of million. These dividends may be paid in cash or accumulate into the Accrued Value at the option of New AON. The accrual shall be calculated on June 30 and December 31 and with respect to the semiannually-compounded return, no interest is required to be paid on any present or future Series A Preferred Stock accrued dividends. The Series A Preferred Stock also participate in distributions with the Class A Common stockholders. 
 
 On September 20, 2023, the Company issued Series A Preferred Stock to AEA Growth Management LP. The number of Series A Preferred Stock shares issued at the Closing of the Business Combination was equal to the aggregate Class C Liquidation Preference pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement. As a result, the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock effectively included an in-kind payout PIK of the accrued dividend since the calculation of the amount issued was based on the Class C Liquidation Preference. As of the Closing, the Company recorded a dividend of Series A Preferred Stock PIK shares with respect to the accrued dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock (the "PIK Dividend") in the December 31, 2023 condensed consolidated statements of mezzanine and stockholders equity. 
 
 Voting 
 
 The holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to elect and appoint one of the directors Series A Director to the Board of Directors. All other directors are appointed by the Class A and Class B Common stockholders. There are no restrictions on which matters the Series A Preferred stockholders are entitled to vote. The Series A Preferred stockholders are entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock would be convertible on the record date of the vote. 
 
 Conversion Rights 
 
 The Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder, into such number of fully-paid Class A Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Accrued Value by the Conversion Price in effect at the time of conversion Conversion Ratio ). The Accrued Value is the Original Issue Price (which is per share of Preferred Stock, as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, combination, or other recapitalization) plus any unpaid dividends, compounded semi-annually. The Conversion Price is initially per Preferred Share subject to adjustment for dilutive issuances of additional shares, dividends to common stockholders, stock splits, mergers, and a anniversary special adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of the common stock. These dividends may be paid in cash or accumulate into the Accrued Value, at the option of New AON, on June 30 and December 31 of each year. The Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the day prior to the date of a Change of Control. 
 
 If at any time on or after the th day after the anniversary of the issue date, any of the Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding and the -Day volume weighted average price VWAP of the Common Stock is less than (as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, combination, or other recapitalization or reclassification), then the Conversion Price shall be adjusted to the greater of (x) the -Day VWAP on such date of determination and (y) (as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, combination, or other recapitalization or reclassification). 
 
 New AON also has the right on or after the third-year anniversary of the date of issuance to cause all (but not less than all) of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted into shares of Class A Common Stock for each share of Series A Preferred Stock at the Conversion Ratio detailed above. The Company may only convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock if the -Day VWAP of the Common Stock immediately prior to the Company Conversion Date is greater than (as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, combination, or other recapitalization).

 AON LLC Common Units, equal to a of the economic interest in AON LLC as of September 30, 2024. Legacy AON Shareholders Common Units are comprised of shares of Class B Common Stock and Class B Prefunded Warrants, which, together with the AON LLC Common Units, may be redeemed at the option of the Legacy AON Shareholder on a -for-one basis for shares of Class A Common Stock or the cash equivalent thereof (based on the market price of the shares of Class A Common Stock at the time of redemption) as determined by New AON. If New AON elects the redemption to be settled in cash, the cash used to settle the redemption must be funded through a private or public offering of Class A Common Stock no later than ten (10) business days after the redemption notice date. Upon the redemption of the AON LLC Common Units and Class B Common Stock for shares of Class A Common Stock or the equivalent thereof, all redeemed shares of Class B Common Stock will be cancelled. The redemption value is determined based on a VWAP of the Class A common shares, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for share splits, share dividends, and similar events affecting Class A Common Stock. After each redemption, AON LLC equity attributable to New AON and the Legacy AON Shareholders is adjusted to reflect New AON s and the Legacy AON Shareholders ownership in AON LLC. 
 
 When applying SEC guidance concerning mezzanine classification, the Company understands that due to the NCI holders having control of the Board, if there is a sequence of remotely possible events that could trigger a redemption, this requires the instrument to be classified as temporary equity, without any regard to probability. Accordingly, though the redemption would require such a remotely possible sequence of events, and such remote sequence of events would also require, in management s view, the Company to take extraordinary actions in order to allow such sequence of events to be remotely possible, the noncontrolling interest is currently classified as temporary equity. In the event that the controlling shareholders control redemption of the shares, the noncontrolling interest will be presented as permanent equity. 
 
 The redeemable noncontrolling interest is recognized at the greater of (1) its initial fair value plus accumulated earnings/(losses) associated with the noncontrolling interest or (2) the redemption value as of the balance sheet date. At September 30, 2024, the redeemable noncontrolling interest was recorded based on its redemption value of million which represented a decrease of million from its redemption value as of December 31, 2023. This measurement adjustment decreased retained deficit by million. Each time a change of interest occurs, AON LLC equity attributable to AON Inc. and the Legacy AON Shareholders is rebalanced to reflect the changes in AON Inc. s and the Legacy AON Shareholder s ownership in AON LLC that occurred throughout the period.

 Hurricanes Helene and Milton 
 
 Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton were major hurricanes that made landfall in the Southeastern United States in late September 2024 and early October 2024, respectively. These hurricanes caused widespread property damage, flooding, power outages, communication interruptions, and severely disrupted normal economic activity in the region. The Company experienced a disruption of operations and temporary clinic closures at approximately locations in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina due to the hurricanes. As of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a reasonable estimate of the financial repercussions of these events cannot be made because, for example, some patient services and treatments not administered due to a clinic closure can be subsequently provided depending on the timing of a clinic reopening. We continue to assess the potential financial impact of these events, however, at this time we do not believe it will have a material effect on our business operations or financial condition.

 Overview 
 Since its inception in 2018, AON has offered an innovative model of physician-led, community-based oncology management. AON preserves and elevates community oncology by helping its physicians navigate the complex healthcare landscape, providing them an efficient platform to work autonomously and thrive, and most importantly, improving the quality of patient care that is being delivered. We are an alliance of physicians and veteran healthcare leaders partnering to ensure the long-term success and viability of oncology diagnosis and treatment in community-based settings. As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 256 physicians and advanced practice providers across 102 locations in 20 states and the District of Columbia. Our robust platform provides oncology practices with comprehensive support, access to revenue- diversifying adjacent services and practice management expertise to empower physicians to make cancer care better for every patient. 
 Our mission is to provide high quality, cost effective cancer care close to where patients live and work. We believe the key to accessible and equitable healthcare lies in the strength of community healthcare practices and we are committed to closing the gap in cancer care to ensure every patient has access to the optimal, comprehensive care needed to help in their fight against cancer. To accomplish this, we have practices in some of the most densely populated cities as well as rural areas where medical resources are scarce. We deliver cancer care innovation by bringing new treatments to the forum and also by ensuring access to the necessary adjacent services to provide comprehensive quality cancer care and preserving the delivery of personalized cancer care in the community oncology setting. 
 Through access to care-enhancing patient services such as a centralized specialty pharmacy, wide ranging clinical lab and pathology services, clinical research, diagnostic imaging, a fully integrated technology platform anchored by an oncology- specific electronic medical record system, as well as a caring management team and a variety of financial assistance programs, our patients receive expert cancer care at each of our clinics. 
 We provide patients a variety of services to enhance patient care throughout the healthcare journey: high-quality and timely laboratory services for routine and specialized testing; in-house professional and technical pathology services providing complete, accurate and timely pathology reports; in-house specialty pharmacy with patient education, financial assistance, and 24/7 patient assistance; and care management support services including nutrition guidance. 
 As the future of healthcare continues to transition from volume to value, we are at the forefront of this initiative by ensuring we remain focused on care quality over care quantity and maintaining a patient-first mentality. Through an integrated system of seamless communication, coordination and patient care for better health outcomes, AON practices benefit from decreased expenditures through the implementation of centralized administrative services, processes, and technologies designed to support effective decision- making such as optimal pricing on drugs and medical supplies. Our patients benefit through our 24/7 clinical care support leading to a reduction in unnecessary emergency room visits and admissions and enhanced care quality. Ultimately, the payors benefit from more efficient delivery of high-quality, comprehensive services comparable to any hospital system at a lower cost point.

 Though our network spans the country, our clinicians are interconnected and focused on driving change not just at their local clinics, but throughout our network. Our Network Practices not only unite in collaboration through a physician advisory board, but they also remain at the forefront of new discoveries and findings by expanding and improving cancer treatment options for every patient through a Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee that continuously updates its formulary in real time as advanced therapeutics come to market and through participating in clinical research to ensure we remain on the cutting edge of cancer protocols. Patients benefit from convenient access to clinical trials that we participate in without the need to travel to large cities or tertiary cancer care facilities, and personalized care by matching a patient s cancer to a tailored therapy using molecular profiling. 
 We have invested significantly in a resilient, integrated technology platform to support the practices which includes a fully integrated electronic health record and a robust decision support tool and analytics engine. Our development of compliance materials ensures consistency and optimal patient experiences that meets or exceeds the Office of Inspector General OIG guidelines. 
 We believe that our position in the market and focus on elevating the state of oncology care with our affiliated providers bodes well for future growth. Our proprietary technology platform supports this growth and enables the Network Practices to standardize and deliver consistent care at scale. We believe that our model will support growth into new markets and allow us to continue to service more patients across the United States.

 Key Factors Affecting Performance Non-GAAP Measures 
 Factors Affecting Our Revenues 
 There are many factors that drive patient service revenues; however, we focus on certain key metrics such as: 
 Total patient encounters which include initial consultations and treatments, new patient encounters, recurring patient encounters and treatments, and cancer vs non cancer patients. 
 Patient referrals which are also an important driver of patient service revenue; we manage the referral pipeline locally through the coordinated efforts of our physician liaisons working with our physicians to market our practices by visiting referral sources such as, primary care providers and other medical specialties. 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 Factors Affecting Our Operating Costs 
 Operating costs are primarily dependent upon factors such as: 
 The cost of prescription drugs used in our treatment plans which include both intravenous and oral oncolytics. Effective management of these costs is a critical component of our business as it is our single largest expense. We manage this cost by strategic volume purchases and continuously evaluating the most clinically effective drug for cancer type through our Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics Committee. 
 Clinical compensation and benefits, including non-medical personnel, represent our second largest operating expense. These costs are impacted by both micro and macro-economic factors as well as local competition for personnel that could impact costs associated with personnel. In particular, in all of our markets, we have seen significant increases in compensation for qualified physician and nursing resources. We continuously monitor wages to mitigate the impact of variations in industry and macro-economic labor conditions. 
 We lease all of our facilities, therefore real-estate costs are a significant component of our operating costs. We continuously monitor local and national real estate conditions to actively manage our exposure to fluctuating occupancy costs. 
 
 Hurricanes Helene and Milton 
 
 Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton were major hurricanes that made landfall in the Southeastern United States in late September 2024 and early October 2024, respectively. These hurricanes caused widespread property damage, flooding, power outages, communication interruptions, and severely disrupted normal economic activity in the region. The Company experienced a disruption of operations and temporary clinic closures at approximately ten locations in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina due to the hurricanes. As of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a reasonable estimate of the financial repercussions of these events cannot be made because, for example, some patient services and treatments not administered due to a clinic closure can be subsequently provided depending on the timing of a clinic reopening. We continue to assess the potential financial impact of these events, however, at this time we do not believe it will have a material effect on our business operations or financial condition. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Patient Service Revenue, net 
 The Company receives payments from the following sources for services rendered: (i) commercial insurers; (ii) pharmacy benefit managers PBMs (iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS (iv) state governments under Medicaid and other programs, including managed Medicare and Medicaid; and (v) individual patients. 
 The primary elements of patient service revenue are from fee for service FFS revenue which includes revenue from required patient infusion and injection treatments, as well as oral prescription drugs. FFS revenue comprise revenues in which we bill and collect for medical services rendered by our physicians or nurse practitioners including office visits and consults. FFS revenue also includes infusion therapies and treatment. FFS revenue consists of fees for medical services provided to patients. Payments for services provided are generally less than billed charges. The Company records revenue net of an allowance for contractual adjustments, which represents the net revenue expected to be collected from third-party payors (including managed care, commercial, and governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid), and patients. 
 These expected collections are based on fees and negotiated payment rates in the case of third-party payors, the specific benefits provided for under each patient s healthcare plan, mandated payment rates in the case of Medicare and Medicaid programs, and historical cash collections (net of recoveries). The recognition of net revenue (gross charges less contractual allowances) from such services is dependent on certain factors, such as, the proper completion of medical charts following a patient encounter, proper medical coding of the charts, and the verification and authorization of each patient s eligibility at the time services are rendered as to the payor(s) responsible for payment of such services. 
 Oral prescription drugs comprise revenues from prescriptions written by our doctors to their patients which are dispensed directly by AON s specialty pharmacy. Revenue for the oral prescription is based on fee schedules set by various PBMs and other third-party payors. The fee schedule is often subject to direct and indirect remuneration DIR fees, which are based primarily on adherence and other metrics. DIR fees may be significant and may be assessed in the periods 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 after payments are received against future payments. The Company recognizes revenue, net of estimated DIR fees, at the time the patient takes possession of the oral drug. 
 Other Revenue 
 Other revenue is primarily generated from service arrangements with various hospitals systems and data contracts as well as through clinical trials. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of services primarily includes chemotherapy drug costs, clinician salaries and benefits, medical supplies, and clinical occupancy costs. Clinicians include oncologists, advanced practice providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. Specialty pharmacy costs primarily include the cost of oral medications dispensed from the specialty pharmacy including overhead costs for running a free-standing pharmacy and shipping costs to patients. 
 General and administrative 
 Our general and administrative expenses include corporate occupancy costs, technology infrastructure, operations, clinical and quality support, finance, legal, human resources, and business development. Depreciation and amortization expenses are also included in general and administrative expenses. The Company expects its general and administrative expenses to increase over time following the consummation of the Business Combination due to the additional legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other costs that the Company will incur as a public company, as well as other costs associated with continuing to grow the business. While we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the foreseeable future, such expenses on average are expected to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term, as the company continues to scale its operations. 
 
 Transaction Expenses 
 Transaction expenses consist of legal costs, professional fees and other due diligence expenses that were incurred in connection with the Business Combination and costs associated with the preparation for initial compliance with Sarbanes Oxley requirements. Transaction expenses also include costs associated with the Delisting, and costs associated with the Third Party Tender Offer.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the 313.1 million increase in revenue is largely attributable to a 18.7 increase in patient encounters, related to both organic growth and growth from acquired practices, driving a 176.4 million revenue increase with 136.7 million due to increased revenue per encounter of 12.2 over the comparable periods. This revenue growth was constrained in part by approximately 10.2 million of incremental implicit price concessions associated with accounts receivable in our legacy and new billing system as the Company transitioned its billing and collection efforts to a new billing system in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Other revenue 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 other revenue increased 0.7 million due to an increase of 2.9 million in data contracts offset by a 2.2 million decrease in clinical trial revenue.

 Cost of revenue 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue increased 122.9 million primarily driven by drug and medical supply costs, due to both increased patient encounters and cost per encounter. Increases in patient encounter volumes at our practices increased cost of revenue by 66.7 million, and the cost per encounter drove a 45.6 million increase. The increased cost of patient encounters was driven by a combination of higher drug and supply costs as well as the drug and service mix patients required. Increases in labor costs drove the remaining 10.6 million increase in cost of revenue as clinical salaries and benefit expenses grew both organically and from acquisition related activity. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue increased 312.5 million primarily driven by drug and medical supply costs, due to both increased patient encounters and cost per encounter. Increases in patient encounter volumes at our practices increased cost of revenue by 140.8 million, and the cost per encounter drove a 129.8 million increase. The increased cost of patient encounters was driven by a combination of higher drug and supply costs as well as the drug and service mix patients required. Additionally, in 2024, the Company issued RSUs under the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan to employees of the Company with various vesting periods including RSUs that vest immediately, over a period of one year, and over a period of two years. The Company recognized an increase of 11.1 million of equity-based compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 associated with the 2024 grant of RSUs, a significant amount of which was related to RSUs that vested immediately upon grant. Refer to Note 12, Equity-Based Compensation, for further discussion.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 In addition to our results of operations prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ), which we have discussed above, we also evaluate our financial performance using Adjusted EBITDA. 
 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization, and income tax expense; as further adjusted for the impact of certain other items that are either non-recurring, infrequent, non-cash, unusual, or items deemed by management to not be indicative of the performance of our core operations, including equity-based compensation; gain or loss on derivative liabilities; revenue cycle transformation; transaction costs; acquisition related costs; and costs and settlements associated with acquisition and divestiture related activities. As a non-GAAP financial measure, our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from similarly termed non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, making comparisons with other companies on the basis of this measure impracticable. 
 
 We believe our computations of Adjusted EBITDA are helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance. In determining which adjustments are made to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA, we consider both (1) certain non-recurring, infrequent, non-cash or unusual items, which can vary significantly from year to year, as well as (2) certain other items that may be recurring, frequent, or settled in cash but which management does not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA to assess operating performance and make business decisions. 
 
 Given our determination of adjustments in arriving at our computations of Adjusted EBITDA, this non-GAAP measure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes or alternatives to net income or loss, revenue, operating income or loss, cash flows from operating activities, or any other financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 To date, the Company has financed its operations principally through the issuance of membership units and long-term debt, and to a lesser extent, cash flows from operations. As discussed below, on June 7, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to issue Class C Preferred Units for net proceeds of approximately 64.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 19.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, 13.6 million available under the PNC Loan Facility, and 1.0 million of availability under its PNC Line of Credit. 
 The Company may incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future due to the investments management intends to continue making in expanding operations and sales and marketing and due to additional general and administrative expenses management expects to incur in connection with operating as a public company. As a result, the Company may require additional capital resources to execute strategic initiatives to grow the business. 
 Management believes that the cash on hand, operating cash flows, proceeds from the 50 million Class A Common Stock Financing, and availability under PNC Facility will be sufficient to fund the Company s operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. The Company s actual results may vary due to, and its future capital requirements will depend on, many factors, including its organic growth rate and the timing and extent of acquisitions of new clinics and 
 60

 expansion into new markets. The Company may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses. The Company could use its available capital resources sooner than management currently expects. The Company may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. 
 
 Reverse Recapitalization 
 
 The Company closed the Business Combination on September 20, 2023 the Closing or the Closing Date ).

Cash Flows 
 Historical information regarding sources of cash and capital expenditures in recent periods and analysis of those sources and uses is provided below. 
 Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operations (16,869) (6,160) (10,709) Net cash used in investing activities 14,809 (24,673) 39,482 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (7,047) 55,560 (62,607)

 Cash flows from operating activities 
 
 The primary sources and uses of our operating cash flow are operating income or operating losses, net of any non-cash items such as stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization. The timing of collections of accounts receivable and the payment of accounts payable, and other working capital items can also impact and cause fluctuations in

Table of Contents 

 our operating cash flow. Cash used in operating activities decreased by 10.7 million du ring the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to: 
 
 The comparative provision of 13.9 million of cash from a decrease in net loss during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, net of changes in adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023; net of 
 
 14.6 million of cash used to fund deferred compensation for physicians in connection with acquisition activities, net of amortization of deferred compensation; 
 
 The comparative usage of cash of 5.5 million from accounts payable, inventory and other receivables, the changes of which are primarily associated with the timing of vendor payments for drug purchases, increases or decreases in drug inventories, and receipt of drug rebates; and 
 
 Other changes in working capital. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 24.7 million net cash used in the comparable period in 2023. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 20, 2024 the Company liquidated its holdings of marketable securities, which provided net cash of 35.9 million, 14.5 million of which was used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, and 6.7 million was used for the acquisition of physician practices. 
 
 Net cash used during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily comprised of 15.9 million of net cash funded to marketable securities on the balance sheet, as well as 9.5 million of cash used for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 Net cash used by financing activities was 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by in financing activities of 55.6 million for the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to 65.0 million of proceeds received from the issuance of redeemable, convertible Class C Units during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There were no such proceeds received in the current period. Current period cash used in financing activities include 2.5 million of payments on notes payable and 3.3 million of payments on certain tax obligations. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, AON does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term off-balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with AON is a party, under which it has any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets. 
 AON does not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Based on the Company s borrowings under the long-term debt arrangement as of September 30, 2024, the Company expects future cash outflows related to interest expense (based on Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index rate of 6.63 as of September 30, 2024 of 1.0 million for the remainder of 2024 and 5.4 million in 2025. 
 The Company also expects a cash outflow of 81.3 million related to the repayment of principal when the PNC Loan Facility matures in June of 2026. 
 The Company expects the following cash flows related to operating leases with third parties: 1.0 million in 2024, 9.2 million in 2025, 8.8 million in 2026, 7.6 million in 2027, 5.9 million in 2028, and 21.5 million thereafter.

 The Company does not have any significant supply or other arrangements which result in material cash requirements other than as described above. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Revenue is recognized under Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 ). The Company determines the transaction price based upon standard charges for goods and services with anticipated consideration due from patients, third-party payors (including health insurers and government agencies) and others. The Company s revenue is primarily derived from patient service revenues, which encompass oncology services provided during patient encounters and shipments of pharmacy prescriptions. Performance obligations for the Company s services provided to patients and most procedures, are satisfied over the time of visit which is the same day services are performed. Performance obligations relating to pharmacy revenue are considered fully satisfied at a point in time upon the customer receiving delivery of the prescription. Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate a significant amount of revenue from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods. 
 As services are performed and prescriptions are shipped, timely billing occurs for services rendered and prescriptions shipped less discounts provided to uninsured patients and contractual adjustments to third-party payors based upon prospectively determined rates and discounted charges. Payment is requested at the time of service for self-paying patients and for patients covered by third-party payors that are responsible for paying deductibles and coinsurance. 
 The Company monitors revenue and receivables to prepare estimated contractual allowances for the anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Payments from third-party payors and Government programs including Medicare and Medicaid may be subject to audit and other retrospective adjustments. Such amounts are considered on an estimated basis when net patient revenue is recorded and are adjusted as final adjustments are determined. 
 The Company has a system and estimation process for recording Medicare net patient service revenue and estimated recoupments as it relates to value-based care VBC revenue included in patient service revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The Company s VBC revenue is primarily generated through its participation in the Enhancing Oncology Model EOM which is an episode-based payment model to promote high-quality cancer care. Participants enter six-month episode periods, and the Company bills a monthly fee during the six-month period based on a fixed rate per participant per month and the total number of participants. Certain quality and compliance metrics are tracked as part of the program and submitted to CMS at the end of the episode period which may result in recoupment of funds. The Company estimates the recoupment amount by developing a recoupment percentage for each period based on historical known recoupment from CMS and applies the recoupment percentage against total fees for the period. Based on the estimate, the Company accrues a liability representing the expected final recoupments based on historical settlement trends. 
 Accounts Receivable 
 Accounts receivable from patients are carried at the original charge for the services provided, and an adjustment is made to the receivable in a contra account based on the historical collection rate for the provider and payor combination. This adjustment takes into consideration any allowance for doubtful accounts. Management determines the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience.

 Business Combinations 
 The Company evaluates acquired practices in accordance with ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This standard clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. Because substantially all of the value of each acquired practice did not relate to a similar group of assets and as each acquired practice contained both inputs and processes necessary to provide economic benefits to the Company, it was determined that each acquisition represents a business combination. Therefore, the transactions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, with limited exceptions, that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs related to business combinations are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. 
 Professional Liability 
 The Company maintains an insurance policy for exposure to professional malpractice insurance risk beyond selected retention levels. Reserves are established for estimates of the loss that will ultimately be incurred on claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported. These reserves are established based on consultation with a third-party actuary. The actuarial valuations consider a number of factors, including historical claims payment patterns, changes in case reserves and the assumed rate of increase in healthcare costs. Management believes the use of actuarial methods to account for these reserves provides a consistent and effective way to measure these subjective accruals. However, due to the sensitive nature of this estimation technique, recorded reserves could differ from ultimate costs related to these claims due to changes in claims reporting, claims payment and settlement practices and differences in assumed future cost increases. Accrued unpaid claims and expenses that are expected to be paid within the next twelve months are classified as current liabilities and included in accrued other. All other accrued unpaid claims and expenses are classified as long-term liabilities and included in other long-term liabilities. Insurance recoveries associated with the unpaid claims are classified as long-term assets included in other assets. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure due to potential changes in inflation or interest rates. We do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Certain of AON s outstanding indebtedness bears interest at a floating rate. As a result, AON may be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of its borrowings under these arrangements. AON does not currently engage in any hedging or derivative instruments to attempt to offset this risk. Based on the total amount of variable debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, if the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index increased by 1.0 due to normal market conditions, AON s interest expense will increase by approximately 0.8 million per annum. 
 AON had 81.3 million of borrowings under loans with variable rates as of September 30, 2024. 
 Inflation Risk 
 The healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are drug and medical supplies costs, medical equipment and other costs. The nationwide shortage of nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers. In particular, like others in the healthcare industry, we have experienced a shortage of nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel in certain geographic areas, which was largely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nationally, the increase demand for healthcare workers has in some regions, required us to offer one-time retention bonuses, pay premium wages above standard compensation for essential workers, and even utilize higher cost temporary labor. This staffing shortage may require us to further enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel. We have also experienced cost increases related to the procurement of medical supplies and equipment as well as construction of new facilities and additional capacity added to existing facilities. Our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. 
 65 

Table of Contents 

 We minimize the impact of inflation on our labor, drug, and supply costs primarily through maintaining strong relationship with our suppliers and GPO and renegotiated contracts with our payors. In addition, AOP has a Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee P T Committee that meets biweekly to evaluate and modify the preferred drug formulary. The P T Committee considers the following in its formulary recommendations: 1) evidence-based research demonstrating favorable clinical outcomes of such treatment; 2) potential adverse events or side effects of such treatment; and 3) cost of such treatment to the applicable stakeholder (patient and payor). 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company on the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including, our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgement in designing and evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting, as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting as defined under the Exchange Act and by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We are in the process of implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate these material weaknesses. 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
