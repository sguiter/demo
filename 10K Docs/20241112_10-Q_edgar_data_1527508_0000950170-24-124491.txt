that we expect will improve our operating efficiency. We expect to incur capital expenditures of million to million, total cash restructuring charges of million to million and total non-cash charges of million to million, each primarily during 2024 and 2025, to execute our plan. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we incurred cash charges of million and million, respectively, primarily related to severance and other exit costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred non-cash charges of million and million, respectively, primarily related to accelerated property, plant and equipment depreciation. The estimated ranges of restructuring charges are provisional and include significant management judgments and assumptions that could change materially as we execute our plans. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and the execution of our plan could result in additional restructuring charges or impairments. Beverage Merchandising Restructuring On , we announced the Beverage Merchandising Restructuring, a plan approved by our Board of Directors to take significant restructuring actions related to our Beverage Merchandising operations. The Beverage Merchandising Restructuring includes, among other things: Closure of our Canton, North Carolina mill, including the cessation of mill operations, during the second quarter of 2023; 

 Closure of our Olmsted Falls, Ohio converting facility and concurrent reallocation of certain production to our remaining converting facilities during the second quarter of 2023; and 

 Reorganizing our operating and reporting structure to achieve increased efficiencies and related cost savings. 

 Additionally, the plan included the exploration of strategic alternatives for our Pine Bluff, Arkansas mill and our Waynesville, North Carolina extrusion facility (the Facilities ). Following authorization by our Board of Directors on July 12, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Facilities and associated assets and liabilities to Suzano S.A. Suzano (the Mill Transaction ). The Mill Transaction closed on October 1, 2024. We received preliminary proceeds of million, inclusive of the million exclusivity payment previously received during the second quarter of 2024 and the preliminary calculation of customary adjustments for closing amounts, such as working capital. The exclusivity payment was recorded in other accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The proceeds received are subject to finalization of the aforementioned closing adjustments. We also entered into a long-term liquid packaging board supply arrangement with Suzano upon closing of the Mill Transaction. We classified the assets and liabilities of the Facilities, including an allocated portion of the goodwill associated with the Beverage Merchandising reporting unit, as held for sale as of July 12, 2024. Upon qualifying as held for sale, we measured the disposal group at the lower of its carrying value and its fair value, less costs to sell, and recognized an impairment charge of million. In addition to this charge, we recorded an million goodwill impairment charge related to the disposal group. The operations of the Facilities did not meet the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. Additionally, we evaluated the assets of our Beverage Merchandising reporting unit that were not allocated to the disposal group for impairment and determined no additional impairment charge was warranted.

(1) We expect to incur any remaining charges primarily in 2024. These charges include certain estimates that are provisional and include significant management judgments and assumptions that could change materially as we complete the execution of our plans. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and the completion of our plan could result in additional restructuring charges, gains, losses or impairments not reflected above. 

 (2) Total cash charges exclude the benefit of any cash proceeds related to sales of any property, plant and equipment that may be disposed of as part of our ongoing restructuring activities. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we received million in cash proceeds and recognized an immaterial gain on the sale of various assets. In addition to the Mill Transaction discussed above, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also received million in proceeds, primarily related to the sale of our Olmsted Falls, Ohio facility that was previously classified as held for sale, resulting in an immaterial gain. 

 (3) Mill Transaction impairment charges included a goodwill impairment charge of million related to the Facilities disposal group. 

 (4) Other non-cash charges include the write-down of certain spare parts classified as inventories on our condensed consolidated balance sheet, the write-off of scrapped raw materials and certain construction in-progress balances, accelerated amortization expense for certain operating lease right-of-use assets and gains or losses on the sale of various property, plant and equipment. 

 (5) Exit, disposal and other transition costs are primarily related to equipment decommissioning and dismantlement, transition labor associated with the facility closures and management restructuring, site remediation, contract terminations, systems conversion and other related costs.

On May 1, 2024, we amended the Credit Agreement to increase the capacity on our Revolving Tranche facility from million to million and extend the maturity date to . We also amended the applicable interest rate and other pricing terms, including by replacing the facility fee with a lower fee on unutilized capacity. On May 28, 2024, we further amended the Credit Agreement to replace the existing million outstanding U.S. term loans Tranche B-3 with a new upsized million tranche of U.S. term loans Tranche B-4. The U.S. term loans Tranche B-4 will mature on . The million proceeds from upsizing the U.S. term loans, together with the proceeds of a million draw upon our Revolving Tranche facility, were used to prepay in full the million of existing U.S. term loans Tranche B-2 maturing in . The U.S. term loans Tranche B-4 have a lower interest rate relative to the U.S. term loans Tranche B-2 and B-3 that they replaced. There were no other material changes to the terms of the Credit Agreement as a result of these amendments.

Our derivatives are comprised of commodity and interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange forward contracts. All derivatives represent Level 2 financial assets and liabilities. Our derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our calculation of the fair value of these financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of non-performance, including counterparty credit risk. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off. We manage the credit risk in connection with our derivatives by limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. During the first quarter of 2024, we began entering into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce our risk from exchange rate fluctuations associated with purchases denominated in a foreign currency. We are exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of our operations and certain commodity risks. In order to manage these risks, we hedge portions of our forecasted purchases expected to occur within the next twelve months that are denominated in non-functional currencies, with foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges. As of September 30, 2024 , we had contracts with U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts of million to exchange the Mexican peso. We believe it is probable that all forecasted cash flow transactions will occur. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into derivative financial instruments with several large financial institutions which swapped the LIBO rate for a weighted average fixed rate of for an aggregate notional amount of

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized an unrealized gain of million within other comprehensive (loss) income for our foreign currency exchange forward contracts. There was unrealized gain or loss during the three months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 , we expected to reclassify million of gains, net of tax, from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income AOCL to earnings over the next twelve months. The actual amount that will be reclassified to future earnings may vary from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we recognized realized gains of million, million, million and million, respectively, within interest expense, net and an unrealized loss of million, an unrealized gain of million, an unrealized gain of million and an unrealized gain of million, respectively, within other comprehensive (loss) income for our interest rate derivatives.

The actual amount that will be reclassified to future earnings may vary from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized unrealized gains of million and million, respectively, in cost of sales, for our commodity swap contracts. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an unrealized gain of million in cost of sales, for our commodity swap contracts.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our Company 
 We are a leading manufacturer and distributor of fresh foodservice and food merchandising products and fresh beverage cartons in North America. We produce a broad range of on-trend and feature-rich products that protect, package and display food and beverages for today s consumers. Our products include containers, drinkware (such as hot and cold cups and lids), cartons for fresh refrigerated beverage products, tableware, meat and poultry trays, liquid packaging board, serviceware, prepared food trays and egg cartons. Our products, many of which are made with recycled, recyclable or renewable materials, are sold to a diversified mix of customers, including restaurants, foodservice distributors, retailers, food and beverage producers, packers and processors. Following authorization by our Board of Directors on July 12, 2024, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the facilities that manufacture liquid packaging board. The transaction closed on October 1, 2024. Refer to Note 2, Restructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Related Charges , for additional details. 
 Business Environment 
 During 2024, we have experienced moderation in demand for certain of our products, primarily driven by the cumulative effect on consumer spending of sustained high levels of inflation in recent years. While we have not observed a material economic contraction to-date, this dynamic may persist in the near-term, which could result in a continued impact on consumer demand and thus our customers purchasing decisions and order patterns. 
 In recent years, we experienced meaningful input cost inflation and challenging labor market conditions. While the rate of inflation has moderated over the past year, we may continue to see increased price sensitivity from our customers in the near term. However, we believe our pricing strategy provides us with flexibility to manage our market position through cost recovery mechanisms and strategic competitive pricing, among others. In this dynamic environment, we remain focused on servicing our customers, improving manufacturing productivity and optimizing costs across our business. 
 The increase in interest rates from historically low levels in recent years, higher levels of inflation and geopolitical factors continue to create uncertainty with respect to the economic outlook. If economic conditions were to deteriorate, a further decline in consumer spending may result, which could lead to a meaningful decline in demand for our products in the remainder of 2024 and beyond. 
 Recent Developments and Items Impacting Comparability 
 Beverage Merchandising Restructuring 
 On March 6, 2023, we announced the Beverage Merchandising Restructuring, a plan approved by our Board of Directors to take significant restructuring actions related to our Beverage Merchandising operations. We expect these actions to increase our production efficiency, streamline our management structure and reduce our ongoing capital expenditures and overhead costs. 
 As a component of the Beverage Merchandising Restructuring, we commenced a process to explore strategic alternatives for our Pine Bluff, Arkansas mill and Waynesville, North Carolina extrusion facility (the Facilities ). Following authorization by our Board of Directors on July 12, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell those facilities and associated assets and liabilities to Suzano S.A. Suzano (the Mill Transaction ). 
 The Mill Transaction closed on October 1, 2024. We received preliminary proceeds of 83 million, inclusive of the 10 million exclusivity payment previously received during the second quarter of 2024 and the preliminary calculation of customary adjustments for closing amounts, such as working capital. The exclusivity payment was recorded in other accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The proceeds received are subject to finalization of the aforementioned closing adjustments. We also entered into a long-term liquid packaging board supply arrangement with Suzano upon closing of the Mill Transaction. 
 We classified the assets and liabilities of the Facilities, including an allocated portion of the goodwill associated with the Beverage Merchandising reporting unit, as held for sale as of July 12, 2024. Upon qualifying as held for sale, we measured the disposal group at the lower of its carrying value and its fair value, less costs to sell, and recognized an impairment charge of 314 million. In addition to this charge, we recorded an 8 million goodwill impairment charge related to the disposal group. The operations of the Facilities did not meet the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. 
 27 

Refer to Note 2, Restructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Related Charges , for additional details. 
 Footprint Optimization 
 On February 29, 2024, we announced the Footprint Optimization, a restructuring plan approved by our Board of Directors to optimize our manufacturing and warehousing footprint that we expect will improve our operating efficiency. 
 Refer to Note 2, Restructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Related Charges , for additional details. 
 Non-GAAP Measures Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations 
 In addition to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, we make use of the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near-term and long-term operating and strategic decisions. 
 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is defined as net (loss) income from continuing operations calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus the sum of income tax expense, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization and further adjusted to exclude certain items, including but not limited to restructuring, asset impairment and other related charges, gains or losses on the sale of businesses and noncurrent assets, non-cash pension income or expense, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives, foreign exchange gains or losses on cash and gains or losses on certain legal settlements. 
 We present Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions and incentivize and reward our employees. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and Board of Directors. We also believe that using Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis because it excludes variations primarily caused by changes in the items noted above. In addition, our CODM, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer, uses Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of each reportable segment to evaluate the operating performance of such segments. 
 Our use of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Instead, you should consider it alongside other financial performance measures, including our net (loss) income from continuing operations and other GAAP results. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses such as those that are the subject of adjustments made in deriving Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, and you should not infer from our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations that our future results will not be affected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items. The following is a reconciliation of our net (loss) income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for each of the periods indicated:

Total Net Revenues. Total net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 46 million, or 3 , to 1,333 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable pricing in the Foodservice segment, largely due to the pass through of higher material costs, and favorable product 
 29 

mix in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment. Lower sales volume was mostly due to a focus on value over volume in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment and the broader demand environment. 
 Cost of Sales. Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 20 million, or 2 , to 1,078 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by higher manufacturing and material costs. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 22 million, or 16 , to 115 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower incentive based compensation costs. 
 Restructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Related Charges. Restructuring, asset impairment and other related charges for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 310 million to 338 million compared to the prior year period. The expense for both periods is primarily related to activities associated with the Beverage Merchandising Restructuring, with the current period including an impairment charge of 322 million related to the Mill Transaction. Refer to Note 2 , Restructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Related Charges , for additional details. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2 million of income compared to 3 million of expense in the prior year period. Refer to Note 10 , Other Income, Net , for additional details. 
 Non-operating Income (Expense), Net. Non-operating income, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1 million of income compared to 2 million of expense in the prior year period. Refer to Note 9, Employee Benefits , for additional details. 
 Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 5 million, or 8 , to 56 million, compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a reduction in total debt outstanding compared to the prior period and a lower interest rate on our floating rate debt as a result of our Credit Agreement amendments. Refer to Note 7 , Debt, for additional details. 
 Income Tax Benefit (Expense). During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a tax benefit of 38 million on loss from continuing operations before tax of 251 million, compared to a tax expense of 22 million on income from continuing operations before tax of 50 million for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for both periods was driven primarily by the inability to recognize a tax benefit on all interest expense. 
 (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations. (Loss) income from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a loss of 213 million compared to income of 28 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to the 322 million Mill Transaction impairment charge. The change also reflects a 60 million decrease in tax expense primarily as a result of the aforementioned impairment charge. 
 Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 13 million, or 6 , to 214 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher manufacturing costs and lower sales volume, partially offset by lower incentive based compensation costs, favorable product mix in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment and favorable pricing, net of material costs passed through, in the Foodservice segment.

Total Net Revenues. Total net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 313 million, or 7 , to 3,923 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the closure of our Canton, North Carolina mill during the second quarter of 2023, lower sales volume and unfavorable product mix. Lower sales volume was mainly due to a focus on value over volume in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment and the broader demand environment. 
 Cost of Sales. Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 532 million, or 14 , to 3,224 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower charges related to the Beverage Merchandising Restructuring as well as the closure of our Canton, North Carolina mill and lower sales volume. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 33 million, or 8 , to 370 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower incentive based compensation costs. 
 Restructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Related Charges. Restructuring, asset impairment and other related charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 228 million to 361 million compared to the prior year period. The expense in both periods is primarily related to activities associated with the Beverage Merchandising Restructuring, with the current period including a 322 million impairment charge related to the Mill Transaction. Refer to Note 2 , Restructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Related Charges , for additional details. 
 Other Income, Net. Other income, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 6 million to 7 million compared to the prior year period. Refer to Note 10, Other Income, Net, for additional details. 
 Non-operating Income (Expense), Net. Non-operating expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1 million of income compared to 6 million of expense in the prior year period. Refer to Note 9, Employee Benefits , for additional details. 
 Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 7 million, or 4 , to 181 million, compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in total debt outstanding, partially offset by a 6 million loss on extinguishment of debt during the current period. Refer to Note 7 , Debt, for additional details. 
 Income Tax Benefit. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a tax benefit of 22 million on loss from continuing operations before tax of 205 million, compared to a tax benefit of 5 million on a loss from continuing operations before tax of 249 million for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for both periods was driven primarily by the inability to recognize a tax benefit on all interest expense. 
 Loss from Continuing Operations. Loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 183 million compared to 244 million in the prior year period. The change included a 219 million increase in gross profit, primarily due to accelerated depreciation expense from the Beverage Merchandising Restructuring incurred in the prior year period, partially offset by lower sales volume in the current period for the reasons discussed above. The change also included a 322 million impairment charge due to the Mill Transaction, and a 33 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, for the reasons discussed above. 
 Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 68 million, or 11 , to 565 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease reflects higher manufacturing costs, lower sales volume and unfavorable product mix in the Foodservice segment, partially offset by lower material costs in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment and lower incentive based compensation costs.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We manage our capital structure in an effort to most effectively execute our strategic priorities and maximize shareholder value. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to support our ongoing operations and to re-invest in our business to drive future growth. Our projected operating cash flows, cash on-hand and available capacity under our revolving credit facility are our primary sources of liquidity for the next 12 months. We expect our liquidity to fund capital expenditures, payments of interest and principal on our debt, cash-based restructuring charges and distributions to shareholders that require approval by our Board of Directors. Additionally, we may continue to utilize portions of our excess cash to repurchase certain amounts of our long-term debt prior to maturity depending on market conditions, among other factors. 
 Cash flows 
 Our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

(300) 

Net cash outflows decreased by 281 million, or 94 , compared to the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in cash used in financing activities driven by 515 million of early debt repayments and repurchases in the prior year period, partially offset by lower net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to lower income from operations and changes in working capital, including a reduction in inventory during the prior period. 
 33 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our primary source of cash was 305 million of net cash provided by operating activities. The net cash provided by operating activities reflects income from operations, partially offset by 148 million of cash interest payments and 48 million of cash taxes. Our primary uses of cash were 152 million of capital expenditures, 67 million of early term loan debt repayments and 54 million of dividends paid. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our primary source of cash was 453 million of net cash provided by operating activities. The net cash provided by operating activities reflects income from operations, partially offset by 177 million of cash interest payments and 51 million of cash taxes. Our primary uses of cash for the same period were 515 million of early debt repayments, 178 million of capital expenditures and 54 million of dividends paid. 
 Dividends 
 During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid cash dividends of 54 million. On November 8, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of 0.10 per share to be paid on December 13, 2024 to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2024. 
 Our Credit Agreement and Notes limit our ability to make dividend payments, subject to specified exceptions. Our Board of Directors must review and approve future dividend payments and will determine whether to declare additional dividends based on our operating performance, expected future cash flows, debt levels, liquidity needs and investment opportunities. 
 Financing and capital resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 3,507 million of total principal amount of borrowings. Refer to Note 7, Debt , for additional details. Of our total debt, 1,587 million is subject to variable interest rates, representing borrowings drawn under our Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, 587 million of the total 1,587 million of variable interest rate indebtedness was not hedged by an interest rate swap, and any additional interest rate swaps into which we enter may not fully mitigate our remaining interest rate risk. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed 391 million of our Revolving Tranche facility and repaid 61 million plus interest. On October 31, 2024, we repaid an additional 70 million. 
 On May 1, 2024, we amended the Credit Agreement to increase the capacity on our Revolving Tranche facility from 250 million to 1,100 million and extend the maturity date to May 1, 2029. We also amended the applicable interest rate and other pricing terms, including by replacing the facility fee with a lower fee on unutilized capacity. 
 On May 28, 2024, we further amended the Credit Agreement to replace the existing 990 million outstanding U.S. term loans Tranche B-3 with a new upsized 1,330 million of U.S. term loans Tranche B-4. The U.S. term loans Tranche B-4 will mature on September 24, 2028. The 340 million proceeds from upsizing the U.S. term loans, together with the proceeds of a 350 million draw upon our Revolving Tranche facility, were used to prepay in full the 690 million of existing U.S. term loans Tranche B-2 maturing in February 2026. The U.S. term loans Tranche B-4 have a lower interest rate relative to the U.S. term loans Tranche B-2 and B-3 that they replaced. There were no other material changes to the terms of the Credit Agreement as a result of these amendments. 
 On September 30, 2024, we repaid 70 million of U.S. term loans Tranche B-4, of which 67 million was considered a prepayment. As a result of this prepayment, we have no further quarterly amortization payments under the U.S. term loans. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the SOFR-based reference rate was 4.85 . 
 Based on the one-month SOFR as of September 30, 2024, and including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, our 2024 annual cash interest obligations on our borrowings are expected to be approximately 220 million. 
 Under the Credit Agreement, we may incur additional indebtedness either by satisfying certain incurrence tests or by incurring such additional indebtedness under certain specific categories of permitted debt. Incremental senior secured indebtedness under the Credit Agreement and senior secured or unsecured notes in lieu thereof are permitted to be incurred up to an aggregate principal amount of 750 million subject to pro forma compliance with the Credit Agreement s total secured leverage ratio covenant. In addition, we may incur senior secured indebtedness in an unlimited amount as long as our total secured leverage ratio does not exceed 4.50 to 1.00 on a pro forma basis, and (in the case of incremental senior secured indebtedness under the Credit Agreement only) we are in pro forma compliance with the Credit Agreement s total secured leverage ratio covenant. The incurrence of unsecured indebtedness, including the issuance of senior notes, and unsecured subordinated indebtedness is also permitted (subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement) if the fixed charge coverage ratio is at least 2.00 to 1.00 on a pro forma basis. 
 34 

Under the respective indentures governing the Notes, we may incur additional indebtedness either by satisfying certain incurrence tests or by incurring such additional indebtedness under certain specific categories of permitted debt. Indebtedness may be incurred under the incurrence tests if the fixed charge coverage ratio is at least 2.00 to 1.00 on a pro forma basis or the consolidated total leverage ratio is no greater than 5.50 to 1.00 and the liens securing first lien secured indebtedness do not exceed a 4.10 to 1.00 consolidated secured first lien leverage ratio. 
 We are required to make annual prepayments of term loans with up to 50 of excess cash flow (which will be reduced to 25 or 0 if specified senior secured first lien leverage ratios are met) as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement. No excess cash flow prepayments were due for the year ended December 31, 2023.

(2) Included 99 million of assets and 22 million of liabilities classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024, and 4 million of assets classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2023. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 168 million of cash and cash equivalents on-hand. We also had 724 million available under our revolving credit facility, net of 46 million utilized in the form of letters of credit under the facility. Our next debt maturity is 217 million of Pactiv Debentures due in December 2025, excluding finance lease obligations. 
 We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to support our ongoing operations in the next 12 months and to invest in future growth to create further value for our shareholders. The increased liquidity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the amendment to our Credit Agreement increasing the availability under our Revolving Tranche facility. We currently anticipate making cash payments between 240 million and 250 million in the aggregate for capital expenditures during 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our working capital was consistent with the prior year period. Our working capital position provides us the flexibility for further consideration of strategic initiatives, including reinvestment in our business and deleveraging of our balance sheet. As a result, we may continue to utilize portions of our excess cash to repurchase certain amounts of our long-term debt prior to maturity depending on market conditions, among other factors. 
 Our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility or to incur additional indebtedness may be limited by the terms of such indebtedness or other indebtedness, including the Credit Agreement and the Notes. The Credit Agreement and the respective indentures governing the Notes generally allow our subsidiaries to transfer funds in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances within the Company. 
 Other than short-term leases executed in the normal course of business, we have no material off-balance sheet obligations. 
 Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions 
 The most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make the most difficult and subjective judgments, often estimating the outcome of future events that are inherently uncertain. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our critical accounting estimates are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 New accounting standards that we have recently adopted, as well as accounting standards that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, is included in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 Except as noted below, there have been no material changes to our market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information, refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 As a result of our operations in Mexico, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from certain transactions and related assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars instead of the Mexican peso. 
 In accordance with our treasury policy, we take advantage of natural offsets to the extent possible. On a limited basis, we use contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange risk arising from receipts and payments denominated in foreign currencies. We generally do not hedge our exposure to translation gains or losses in respect of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency assets or liabilities. Additionally, when considered appropriate, we may enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange risk arising from specific transactions. As of September 30, 2024, we had contracts with U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts of 8 million to exchange the Mexican peso in order to hedge certain U.S. dollar purchases of inventory. 
 A 10 increase or decrease in the spot rate used to value the forward exchange contracts, applied as of September 30, 2024, would have resulted in a change of 1 million in the unrealized gain recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss) income. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In connection with the preparation of this report, management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
