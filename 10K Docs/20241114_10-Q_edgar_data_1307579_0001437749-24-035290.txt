FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations and market trends and expectations. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 
 
 The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Our plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued expansion of our business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future political, legislative, economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. This is especially underlined by the potential impacts from the prevailing macro-economic uncertainty on the Company, including the related effects to our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. Although we believe that our assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. 
 
 Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning: 

Our ability to continue as a going concern; 

The impact from the prevailing geopolitical uncertainty including the war between Ukraine and Russia as well as the escalating conflict between Hamas and Israel in the Middle East; 

Operational exposure related to increased macro-economic uncertainty, risk of a prolonged period of inflationary pressure, potential energy shortages, and/or volatile energy and electricity prices across Europe; 

The resurgence of COVID-19 or similar global pandemics; 

Our dependence on a few major customers and the ability to maintain future relationships with one or more of these major customers; 

Our ability to operate with financial stability and secure access to external financing and adequate liquidity; 

Our ability to secure and source supplies of raw materials and key components in due time and at competitive prices; 

Our reliance on subcontractors or delivery of new machinery to develop sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand; 

Our ability to achieve revenue growth and penetrate new markets; 

Our dependence on the expertise and experience of our management team and the retention of key employees; 

Our reliance and access to qualified personnel to expand our business; 

Our ability to adapt to potentially adverse changes in legislative, regulatory and political frameworks; 

Changes in emissions and environmental regulations, and potential further tightening of emission standards; 

Our dependence on corporate or government funding for emissions control programs;

Table of Contents 

Exposure to potentially adverse tax consequences; 

Our ability to compete under changing governmental standards by which our products are evaluated; 

The financial impact from the fluctuation and volatility of foreign currencies; 

The potential monetary costs of defending our intellectual property rights; 

Our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and manufacturing know-how; 

The possibility of a dispute over intellectual property developed in conjunction with third parties with whom we have contractual relationships; 

The possibility that we could become subject to litigation that could be costly, limit or cancel our intellectual property rights or divert time and efforts away from our business operations; 

The potential negative impact to the sale of our products caused by technological advances of our competitors; 

The potential liability for environmental harm or damages resulting from technical faults or failures of our products; 

The possibility that an investor located within the United States may not be able to, or find it difficult to, enforce any judgments obtained in United States courts because a significant portion of our assets and some of our officers and directors may be located outside of the United States; 

The possibility that we may not be able to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, leading to inaccurate reports of our financial results; 

The possibility of breaches in the security of our information technology systems; 

The liability risk of our compliance to environmental laws and regulations and evolving disclosure requirements; 

The potential negative impact of more stringent environmental laws and regulations, along with evolving disclosure requirements, as governmental agencies seek to improve minimum standards; and 

The possibility that enforcement actions to suspend or severely restrict our business operations could be brought against the Company for our failure to comply with laws or regulations and the potential costs of defending against such actions. 

Any forward-looking statement made by us herein speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can we assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

The Company has incurred significant recent losses, which raises substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Continued market uncertainty and reduced order intake caused by weakening global macroeconomic conditions or recession could unfavorably impact the Company s ability to generate positive cash flow and thereby significantly reduce its profitability and liquidity position. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in executing the planned revenue growth, cost reductions, strategy, and profitability improvement measures, thus achieving profitable operations. 
 
 We continue to analyze various alternatives, including potentially obtaining debt or equity financings or other arrangements. As further disclosed in Note 10 below, on September 27, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with certain investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell common stock and warrants for gross proceeds of up to million in two tranches. In connection with the closing of the first tranche on September 27, 2024, the Company received gross proceeds of approximately million. The Company obtained stockholder approval at our stockholders' meeting on November 8, 2024 on the issuance of the securities in the second tranche. On November 12, 2024, the second tranche closed, and the Company received gross proceeds of approximately million. Our future success depends on our ability to accelerate growth, restore profitability, and raise capital as needed. 
 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and their carrying amounts, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As we issue additional securities to raise funds, these securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and our current shareholders may experience dilution. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to curtail our current development programs, reduce operating costs, forego future development and other opportunities, or even terminate our operations.

Revenues 
 
 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,478,221 compared to 5,070,446 for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of 2,592,225 or 51.1 . The unfavorable change was attributable to a decrease in deliveries of ceramic membranes, DPFs, liquid filtration systems, and aftermarket sales, partly offset by increased sales of plastics products and progress on an external R D project to further strengthen our technology base. The decrease in deliveries of liquid filtration systems was primarily attributed to reduced deliveries of pool filtration systems and fewer deliveries of pilot systems for industrial applications. The decline in aftermarket sales was attributable to elevated remediation work and associated deliveries in the same period of 2023. The Company believes that the decrease in sales of ceramic membranes and DPFs reflects temporary market conditions, with customers awaiting potential interest rate cuts.

Gross Profit (Loss) 
 
 Gross loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 209,533 (representing a gross loss margin of 8.5 compared to a gross profit of 948,565 (representing a gross profit margin of 18.7 for the same period in 2023, marking a decrease of 1,158,098, or 122.1 . This decline was primarily driven by the reduction in revenue and an unfavorable sales mix, which resulted in a lower proportion of high-margin products such as liquid filtration systems and ceramic membranes. This impact was partly offset by lower depreciation expenses. Included in the gross profit was depreciation of 478,902 and 663,938 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,380,440, representing a decrease of 266,978, or 10.1 , compared to 2,647,418 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Selling expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 610,713 compared to 965,039 for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of 354,326, or 36.7 . The decrease in selling expenses is attributable to a decrease in executive officers, as well as reductions in travel costs, investor relations, and expenses related to external sales consultancy services. 
 
 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,491,366 compared to 1,253,779 for the same period in 2023, representing an increase of 237,587, or 18.9 . The increase was attributable to the addition of new positions in supply chain and project management, as well as increased legal expenses and insurance costs. Additionally, one-time expenses were incurred for the relocation of our plastics production facility. Included in general and administrative expenses were non-cash compensation of 161,853 and 143,195 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 278,361 compared to 428,600 for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of 150,239, or 35.1 . The decrease was primarily attributed to a reduction in external costs associated with finalizing ongoing projects in the same period in 2023, as well as a decrease in the average number of employees engaged in research and development activity as the Company streamlined and centralized the R D function. 
 
 Other Income (Expenses) 
 
 Other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 260,614 compared to other income of 270,143 for the comparable period in 2023, representing a decrease of 530,757, or 196.5 . The decrease was attributable to a loss on currency transactions, reduced interest income as well as increased debt discount amortization due to the extension of the maturity date for the senior promissory notes, with additional warrants issued as consideration for the extension. 
 
 Net Loss 
 
 As a result of the cumulative effect of the factors described above, we had a net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 2,840,526 compared to 1,414,230 for the comparable period in 2023, representing an increase in net loss of 1,426,296, or 100.9 .

Revenue 
 
 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 11,198,627 compared to 14,071,984 for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of 2,873,357, or 20.4 . The decline was mainly due to reduced deliveries of liquid filtration systems, plastics products, ceramic membranes and aftermarket sales, partly offset by increased sales of DPFs. 
 
 The decrease in deliveries of liquid filtration systems was mainly driven by reduced deliveries of pool filtration systems and marine scrubber systems. The decline in aftermarket sales was primarily due to remediation work executed in the same period in 2023. The reduction in sales of plastic products was largely due to a significant one-time sale recorded in 2023 that did not recur in the current period. The increase in sales of DPFs was primarily driven by the effective execution of strategies designed to capitalize on the increased demand for DPFs. 
 
 Gross Profit (Loss) 
 
 Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 778,780 (or gross profit margin of 7 compared to gross profit of 2,502,435 (or a gross profit margin of 17.8 for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of 1,723,655, or 68.9 . This decline in gross profit can be attributed to the decrease in revenue and an unfavorable sales mix, which resulted in a lower proportion of high-margin products such as liquid filtration systems and ceramic membranes. Specifically, the deliveries of containerized oil and gas pilot systems to the Middle East and the U.S. contributed to lower-than-usual margins, reflecting a strategic decision aimed at demonstrating and validating the value proposition associated with our technology and seeding the market for future growth. The decline in gross profit was partly offset by decreased depreciation as well as continued initiatives aimed at optimizing manufacturing processes, which have improved profitability within DPF and ceramic membrane production. Included in the gross profit was depreciation of 1,372,482 and 1,915,515 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Expenses 
 
 Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 7,501,292, representing a decrease of 495,621, or 6.2 , compared to 7,996,913 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Selling expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 1,983,414, compared to 3,175,699 for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of 1,192,285, or 37.5 . The decrease in selling expenses is attributable a decrease in executive officers, as well as reductions in bonus payouts, travel costs, marketing expenses, and expenses related to external sales consultancy services. 
 
 General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 4,577,413, compared to 3,690,211 for the same period in 2023, representing an increase of 887,202, or 24.0 . The increase in general and administrative expenses was attributable to newly created positions in supply chain and project management, as well as increased legal expenses, insurance costs, and recruitment costs associated with the resignations of our CFO and VP of Sales. Additionally, one-time expenses were incurred for the relocation of our plastics production facility. Furthermore, the increase is partly attributable to the release of bonus provisions in the comparable period of 2023. Included in general and administrative expenses was non-cash compensation amounting to 521,791 and 494,292 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 940,465 compared to 1,131,003 for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of 190,538, or 16.8 . The change is attributable to more focused R D efforts with fewer ongoing projects combined with a decrease in the average number of employees engaged in research and development activities, as the Company streamlined and centralized the R D function, partly offset by one-time exit costs of a loss-making external development project. 
 
 Other Income (Expenses) 
 
 Other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 656,659 compared to other income of 92,360 for the comparable period in 2023, representing a decrease of 749,019, or 811.0 . The increase in other expenses was attributable to the non-cash loss associated with the disposal of property and equipment, decreased interest income and increased debt discount amortization cost due to the extension of the maturity date for the senior promissory notes, with additional warrants issued as consideration for the extension. The increase in other expenses was offset by a gain on currency transactions due to the EUR/DKK decline against the USD during the period. 
 
 Net Loss 
 
 As a result of the cumulative effect of the factors described above, we had a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 7,340,521 compared to 5,359,025 for the comparable period in 2023, representing an increase in net loss of 1,981,496, or 37.0 . 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company has historically financed operations through offerings of equity or debt instruments, internally generated cash from operations and our available lines of credit. On September 30, 2024, we had cash of 4,535,266 and net working capital of 9,963,511, and on December 31, 2023, we had cash of 10,422,181 and net working capital of 14,590,432. On September 30, 2024, our net working capital had decreased by 4,626,921 compared to December 31, 2023, mainly as a result of a reduction in cash and cash equivalents to fund operating losses. 
 
 The Company has incurred significant recent losses, which raises substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Continued market uncertainty and reduced order intake caused by weakening global macroeconomic conditions or recession could unfavorably impact the Company s ability to generate positive cash flow and thereby significantly reduce its profitability and liquidity position. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in executing the planned revenue growth, cost reductions, strategy, and profitability improvement measures, thus achieving profitable operations.

We continue to analyze various alternatives, including potentially obtaining debt or equity financings or other arrangements. As further disclosed in Note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on September 27, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with certain investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell Common Stock and warrants for gross proceeds of up to 10 million in two tranches. In connection with the closing of the first tranche, the Company received gross proceeds of approximately 1.2 million. The Company obtained stockholder approval at our stockholders' meeting on November 8, 2024 on the issuance of the securities in the second tranche. On November 12, 2024, the second tranche closed and the Company received gross proceeds of approximately 8.8 million. Our future success depends on our ability to accelerate growth, restore profitability, and raise capital as needed. 
 
 As we issue additional securities to raise funds, these securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and our current shareholders may experience dilution. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to curtail our current development programs, reduce operating costs, forgo future development and other opportunities, or even terminate our operations. 
 
 Senior Promissory Notes 
 
 On June 22, 2022, the Company issued and sold Senior Promissory Notes in an aggregate principal amount of 6.0 million (the Notes and issued warrants to purchase 531,250 shares of Common Stock to affiliates of Bleichroeder L.P., 21 April Fund, L.P., and 21 April Fund, Ltd. (together, the Purchasers ), pursuant to a note and warrant purchase agreement entered into with the Purchasers (the Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement ). The warrants issued in this transaction have an exercise price of 5.20 per share, a term of five years and are exercisable for cash at any time. 
 
 The Notes originally had a term of 24 months and do not bear interest during this period. If the Notes are not repaid on or before the second anniversary of issuance, however, the Notes will thereafter bear interest of 10 per annum, which will increase by 1 each month the Notes remain unpaid, up to a maximum of 16 per annum, payable monthly. 
 
 Additionally, as part of the transaction, the Company issued 28,846 warrants to the placement agent. The warrants issued in this transaction have an exercise price of 5.20 per share, a term of five years and are exercisable for cash at any time. 
 
 As a result, the Company recorded an initial debt discount of 695,749, based on the relative fair value of the warrants and Notes issued. The Company determined the fair value of the warrants by using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model, with the following assumptions: expected term of 2.5 years, stock price of 3.44, exercise price of 5.20, volatility of 80.8 , risk-free rate of 3.13 , and no forfeiture rate. The debt discount will be accreted according to the effective interest method over the contractual term of the Notes. The warrants qualified for equity classification and were reported within Additional Paid-In Capital. 
 
 On October 13, 2023, the Company and the Purchasers entered into an amendment to the Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the Amendment and Allonge No. 1 to each of the Notes (collectively, the Allonges effective as of September 30, 2023, pursuant to which the Company and the Purchasers extended the maturity date of the Notes from June 20, 2024, to January 1, 2026 (the Extension ). As consideration for the Extension, simultaneously with the entry into the Amendment and Allonges, the Company issued to the Purchasers additional warrants to purchase an aggregate of 531,250 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of 5.20 per share, subject to adjustment as provided therein (the 2023 Warrants ). The 2023 Warrants are exercisable at any time prior to the five-year anniversary of the initial exercise date of September 30, 2023. The Amendment qualifies as a modification and entitles the Purchasers to registration rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the 2023 Warrants pursuant to the existing Registration Rights Agreement, dated June 22, 2022, by and between the Company and the Purchasers. 
 
 As a result of the amendment, the Company recorded an initial debt discount of 1,193,206, based on the fair value of the warrants issued. The Company determined the fair value of the warrants by using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model, with the following assumptions: expected term of 5.0 years, stock price of 3.89, exercise price of 5.20, volatility of 73.66 , risk-free rate of 4.60 , and no forfeiture rate. The debt discount will be accreted according to the effective interest method over the contractual term of the Notes. The warrants qualified for equity classification and were reported within Additional Paid-In Capital

Cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 5,528,442, representing an unfavorable change of 2,554,778 compared to cash flows used in operating activities of 2,973,664 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash flows used in operating activities for the period consists mainly of the net loss of 7,340,521, adjusted for depreciation and other non-cash-related items of 3,455,950, as well as an increase in inventory of 901,122 and a decrease in accounts payable of 736,726, partly offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of 867,035. 
 
 Cash flows used in investing activities were 28,767 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to cash flows used in investing activities of 2,261,131 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an improvement of 2,232,364. The investing activities include general purchases of production equipment to continue optimizing production throughput and the internal production of rental assets, partly offset by proceeds from the disposition of production equipment in our Ballerup facility. 
 
 Cash flows used in financing activities were 125,718 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of 718,327 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an unfavorable change of 844,045. The finance activities include the repayment of lease agreements in connection with the sales of production equipment in Ballerup as mentioned above, partly offset by the equity raise, generating net proceeds 1,107,385 from the issuance of common stock and prefunded warrants. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. We are not aware of any material transactions that are not disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: 

The assessment of revenue recognition, which impacts revenue and cost of sales; 

the assessment of allowance for product warranties, which impacts gross profit; 

the assessment of collectability of Accounts receivable, which impacts operating expenses if and when we record bad debt or adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts; 

the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross profit or operating expenses if and when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation; 

the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; 

the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross profit; and 

the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross profit or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment. 

Recently Enacted Accounting Standards 
 
 For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1: Recently Enacted Accounting Standards in the accompanying financial statements. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are not required to provide quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because we are a smaller reporting company.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) and (c) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a misstatement of the registrant's financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 
 Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were not effective as of the period covered by this Quarterly Report due to material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. For more information on material weaknesses identified by management, please reference our Form 10-K filed on March 22, 2024 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our Form 10-K/A filed on April 30, 2024 for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Management's Remediation Initiatives 
 
 In response to the identified material weaknesses, our management, with oversight from the Company s Audit Committee, has been and will continue to dedicate necessary resources to enhance the Company s internal control over financial reporting and remediate the identified material weaknesses. As an example of such remediation, in 2023 the Company hired additional employees into the finance department, and the Company implemented a new ERP system along with other IT programs to help reinforce its controls and processes, and these investments are an important step in the remediation of the material weaknesses. During 2022, the Company introduced an updated Delegation of Authority, with the overall purpose to provide clarity for all employees on the extent to which they can commit the Company and at the same time provide the Company with assurance that decisions about agreements are made by the appropriate functions and employees. Lastly, the Company has started the process of redesigning and ensuring documentation of all processes and procedures related to the financial reporting process to ensure the effective design and operation of process-level controls. 
 
 While management believes that the actions implemented and planned will improve the overall system of internal control over financial reporting and will remediate the identified material weaknesses, these material weaknesses cannot be considered fully remediated until the applicable relevant controls operate for a sufficient period of time. 
 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls 
 
 An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 While management believes that the steps that we have taken and plan to take will improve the overall system of internal control over financial reporting and will remediate identified material weaknesses, the material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until the applicable relevant controls operate for a sufficient period of time.
