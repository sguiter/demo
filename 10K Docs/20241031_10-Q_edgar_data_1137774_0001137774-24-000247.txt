 million, and acquired a equity interest as a limited partner, in Prismic Life Holding Company LP Prismic ), a Bermuda-exempted limited partnership that owns all of the outstanding capital stock of Prismic Life Reinsurance, Ltd. Prismic Re ), a licensed Bermuda-based life and annuity reinsurance company. As this investment is accounted for under the equity method, both Prismic and Prismic Re are considered related parties. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2023, the operating results of Corporate and Other reflect the Company s share of earnings in Prismic on a quarter lag. For information regarding the Company s initial reinsurance transaction with Prismic Re, effective September 2023, see Note 12. 
 
 As part of its continuous improvement process, the Company is working to become a leaner and more agile company by simplifying its management structure, empowering its employees with faster decision-making processes and investing in technology and data platforms. As part of this, the Company is implementing changes to its organizational structure and recorded a restructuring charge of million to General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 within its Corporate and Other operations. The Company expects these actions will create operating efficiencies, and provide reinvestment capacity to build capabilities, realize additional efficiencies, strengthen its competitiveness and fuel future growth.

Out of Period Adjustments 
 
 In the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded two unrelated out-of-period adjustments resulting in an aggregate net charge of million to Income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of joint ventures and other operating entities for the second quarter of 2024. These adjustments did not have an impact to adjusted operating income, which is the Company s segment measure of performance. 
 
 The adjustments included i) an million valuation-related pre-tax charge from an increase to the policyholder account balances of indexed variable annuity products; and ii) a million pre-tax charge from an increase to the allowance for credit losses related to certain loan balances. 
 
 These adjustments impacted the previously issued interim financial statements for the first quarter of 2024 and had no impact to any other previously reported quarterly or annual financial statements. As such, these adjustments do not impact the results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and will not impact the 2024 annual financial statements.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity available-for-sale securities without an allowance of million and million, respectively, related to 1 highest quality or 2 high quality securities based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC or equivalent rating and million and million, respectively, related to other than high or highest quality securities based on NAIC or equivalent rating. As of September 30, 2024, the million of gross unrealized losses of twelve months or more were concentrated in the finance, consumer non-cyclical and utility sectors within corporate securities as well as in foreign government securities. As of December 31, 2023, the million of gross unrealized losses of twelve months or more were concentrated in the finance, consumer non-cyclical and utility sectors within corporate securities, as well as in foreign government securities. 
 
 In accordance with its policy described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that an adjustment to earnings for credit losses related to these fixed maturity securities was not warranted at September 30, 2024. This conclusion was based on detailed analysis of the underlying credit and cash flows for each security. Gross unrealized losses are primarily attributable to increases in interest rates, general credit spread widening and foreign currency exchange rate movements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not intend to sell these securities, and it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis.

billion of account values of PDI traditional variable annuity contracts with guaranteed living benefits. See Note 12 for additional information regarding this transaction. As a result of this transaction, a ceded MRB asset balance was established to fair value the reinsurance reimbursements to the Company. The establishment of the fair value also required an estimate of NPR for AuguStar, which may differ from the Company however, the NPR spreads for AuguStar were developed using a methodology similar to that of the Company. 
 (10) The utilization rate assumption estimates the percentage of contracts that will utilize the benefit during the contract duration, and begin lifetime withdrawals at various time intervals from contract inception. The remaining contractholders are assumed to either begin lifetime withdrawals immediately or never utilize the benefit. Utilization assumptions may vary by product type, tax status and age. The impact of changes in these assumptions is highly dependent on the product type, the age of the contractholder at the time of the sale, and the timing of the first lifetime income withdrawal. Range reflects the utilization rate for the vast majority of business with living benefits. 
 (11) The withdrawal rate assumption estimates the magnitude of annual contractholder withdrawals relative to the maximum allowable amount under the contract. These assumptions vary based on the age of the contractholder, the tax status of the contract and the duration since the contractholder began lifetime withdrawals. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the minimum withdrawal rate assumption is and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the maximum withdrawal rate assumption may be greater than . The fair value of the liability will generally increase the closer the withdrawal rate is to and decrease as the withdrawal rate moves further away from . 
 (12) The range reflects the mortality rates for the vast majority of business with living benefits and other contracts, with policyholders ranging from to years old. While the majority of living benefits have a minimum age requirement, certain other contracts do not have an age restriction. This results in contractholders with mortality rates approaching for certain benefits. Mortality rates may vary by product, age and duration. A mortality improvement assumption is also incorporated into the overall mortality table. 
 (13) Option budget estimates the expected long-term cost of options used to hedge exposures associated with equity price and interest rate changes. The level of option budget determines future costs of the options, which impacts the growth in account value and the valuation of embedded derivatives. 
 
 Interrelationships Between Unobservable Inputs In addition to the sensitivities of fair value measurements to changes in each unobservable input in isolation, as reflected in the table above, interrelationships between these inputs may also exist, such that a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another or multiple inputs. Examples of such interrelationships for significant internally-priced Level 3 assets and liabilities are as follows: 
 
 Corporate Securities The rate used to discount future cash flows reflects current risk-free rates plus credit and liquidity spread requirements that market participants would use to value an asset. The discount rate may be influenced by many factors, including market cycles, expectations of default, collateral, term and asset complexity. Each of these factors can influence discount rates, either in isolation, or in response to other factors. During weaker economic cycles, as the expectations of default increase, credit spreads widen, which results in a decrease in fair value. 
 
 Commercial Mortgage-backed Securities Interrelationships may exist between the prepayment rate, the default rate and/or loss severity, depending on specific market conditions. In stronger economic cycles, prepayment rates are generally driven by underlying property appreciation and subsequent cash-out refinances, while default rates and loss severity may be lower. During weaker economic cycles, prepayment rates may decline, while default rates and loss severity increase. Generally, a change in the assumption used for the probability of default would be accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for the loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for prepayment rates. The impact of these factors on average life and economics varies with the deal structure and tranche subordination. 
 
 Market Risk Benefits The Company expects efficient benefit utilization and withdrawal rates to generally be correlated with lapse rates. However, behavior is generally highly dependent on the facts and circumstances surrounding the individual contractholder, such as their liquidity needs or tax situation, which could drive lapse behavior independent of other contractholder behavior assumptions. To the extent more efficient contractholder behavior results in greater in-the-moneyness

 In both 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized an unfavorable impact to net income attributable to the actuarial assumption update for direct and assumed MRBs, primarily due to updates to policyholder behavior assumptions on certain variable annuities. 
 
 The Company issues certain variable annuity insurance contracts where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder a return of no less than (1) total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return, and/or (2) the highest anniversary contract value on a specified date adjusted for any withdrawals. These guarantees include benefits that are payable in the event of death, annuitization or at specified dates during the accumulation period and withdrawal and income benefits payable during specified periods. 
 
 The Company also issues indexed variable annuity contracts for which the return is tied to the return of specific indices where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder a return of no less than total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals upon death. In certain of these indexed variable annuity contracts, the Company also contractually guarantees to the contractholder withdrawal benefits payable during specific periods. 
 
 For guarantees of benefits that are payable in the event of death, the net amount at risk is generally defined as the current guaranteed minimum death benefit in excess of the current account balance at the balance sheet date. The Company s primary risk exposures for these contracts relates to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including fixed income and equity market returns, contract lapses and contractholder mortality. 
 
 For guarantees of benefits that are payable at annuitization, the net amount at risk is generally defined as the present value of the minimum guaranteed annuity payments available to the contractholder determined in accordance with the terms of the contract in excess of the current account balance. The Company s primary risk exposures for these contracts relates to actual

 of the Company s statutory reserves on its in-force guaranteed universal life block of business as of December 31, 2023. This transaction is structured on a modified coinsurance basis and follows reinsurance accounting. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a million deferred reinsurance gain that will be amortized into income over the estimated remaining life of the reinsured policies. The reinsurance payables, which represent the Company s obligations under the modified coinsurance arrangement, are netted with the reinsurance recoverables in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Separately, effective September 2019, Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation PALAC ), a previously wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, entered into an agreement with Somerset Re, to coinsure business, on a quota share funds withheld basis, related to fixed indexed annuities. This agreement was subsequently novated from PALAC to Pruco Life effective October 2021, in connection with the sale of PALAC effective April 2022. Under this reinsurance agreement, which is accounted for under the deposit method of accounting, the Company cedes to Somerset Re its quota share of the insurance liabilities with respect to the reinsured

million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and the funds withheld liabilities were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Effective September 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with Prismic Re to reinsure approximately billion of reserves, representing approximately of the in-force structured settlement annuities business previously issued by PICA, of which is on a coinsurance with funds withheld basis and of which is on a coinsurance basis. The reinsurance of the structured settlement annuities that provide periodic payments for the lifetime of the annuitant follows reinsurance accounting. The reinsurance of structured settlement annuities that provide payments for a guaranteed period of time and do not include life contingency risk follows deposit accounting. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a million deferred reinsurance loss that will be amortized into income over the estimated remaining life of the reinsured contracts. 
 
 Effective April 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with The Ohio National Life Insurance Company, now known as AuguStar, an affiliate of Constellation Insurance Holdings, Inc., to reinsure approximately billion of account values of PDI traditional variable annuity contracts with guaranteed living benefits issued by Pruco Life, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. This block represents approximately of the Company s remaining legacy in-force traditional variable annuity block by account value. The Company ceded of separate account liabilities under modified coinsurance and of general account liabilities under coinsurance of its Pruco Life issued PDI traditional variable annuity contracts. The general account liabilities associated with PDI s guaranteed living and death benefits and the corresponding reinsurance of those liabilities are accounted for as market risk benefits.

 Effective April 2022, in connection with the sale of the Full Service Retirement business, the Company entered into separate agreements with external counterparties, Great-West and Great-West Life Annuity Insurance Company of New York, now known as Empower Annuity Insurance Company of America and Empower Life Annuity Insurance Company of New York, respectively, to reinsure a portion of its Full Service Retirement business. The Company ceded of separate account liabilities under modified coinsurance and of general account liabilities under coinsurance of its Full Service Retirement business. The Company s Full Service Retirement business consists of market value and stable value separate accounts as well as general account products, including stable value accumulation funds and a stable value wrap product known as a synthetic guaranteed investment contract. The majority of these products are considered investment contracts as they do not contain significant insurance risk; therefore, the reinsurance of such products are accounted for under the deposit method of accounting. The reinsurance agreement offers the policyholders the opportunity to novate their contracts from the Company to Empower and any such novated contracts shall cease to be reinsured under this agreement. 
 
 Effective April 2022, in connection with the sale of the PALAC legal entity, now known as Fortitude Life Insurance and Annuity Company FLIAC ), the Company entered into a reinsurance agreement with FLIAC under which the Company assumed all of FLIAC s indexed variable annuities under modified coinsurance. The reinsurance of the indexed variable annuities transfers all significant risks, including mortality risk, embedded in the reinsured contracts. As a result of the agreement, reinsurance recoverables includes the assumed modified coinsurance receivable, which reflects the value of the invested assets retained by FLIAC and the associated asset returns. The Company also assumed via coinsurance all of FLIAC s fixed indexed annuities with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal income feature, which are accounted for under the deposit method of accounting. The reinsurance agreement offers the policyholders the opportunity to novate their contracts from FLIAC to the Company and any such novated contracts shall cease to be reinsured under this agreement. 
 
 Effective April 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Union Hamilton Reinsurance, Ltd. Union Hamilton an external counterparty, to reinsure approximately of the Prudential Premier Retirement Variable Annuity with Highest Daily Lifetime Income HDI v.3.0 business, a guaranteed benefit feature.

Reinsurance on business subject to this agreement remains in force for the duration of the underlying annuity contracts. New sales subsequent to December 31, 2016 are not covered by this external reinsurance agreement. This reinsurance agreement is accounted for as market risk benefits.

billion. The Company acquired the general account business through a coinsurance arrangement and, for certain types of general account policies, a modified coinsurance arrangement. The Company acquired the separate account business through a modified coinsurance arrangement. In May 2018, Hartford Financial sold a group of operating subsidiaries, which included of the Company s counterparties to these reinsurance arrangements, to Talcott Resolution Life Insurance Company Talcott Resolution ). Talcott Resolution was acquired by Sixth Street in July 2021. There was no impact to the terms, rights or obligations of the Company, or operation of these reinsurance arrangements, as a result of these changes in control of such counterparties. 
 
 Since 2011, the Company has entered into a number of reinsurance agreements to assume pension liabilities in the United Kingdom. Under these arrangements, the Company assumes the longevity risk, and in some arrangements, also the investment risk associated with the pension benefits of certain specified beneficiaries. 
 
 In 2006, the Company acquired the variable annuity business of The Allstate Corporation Allstate through a reinsurance transaction. The reinsurance arrangements with Allstate include a coinsurance arrangement associated with the general account liabilities assumed and a modified coinsurance arrangement associated with the separate account liabilities assumed. The reinsurance payables, which represent the Company s obligations under the modified coinsurance arrangement, are netted with the reinsurance recoverables in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. During the fourth quarter of 2021, Allstate sold the counterparties to the aforementioned variable annuity reinsurance transaction to third parties. There was no impact to the terms, rights or obligations of the Company, or operation of these reinsurance arrangements, as a result of this change in control of such counterparties. 
 
 For the domestic business, life and disability reinsurance is accomplished through various plans of reinsurance, primarily yearly renewable term, per person excess, excess of loss, and coinsurance. On policies sold since 2000, the Company has reinsured a significant portion of the individual life mortality risk. Placement of reinsurance is accomplished primarily on an automatic basis with some specific risks reinsured on a facultative basis. The Company is authorized and has historically retained up to million per life, but reduced its operating retention limit to million per life in 2013 and then down to million per life for new business starting in 2020. Retention in excess of the operating limit is on an exception basis. 
 
 The international business primarily uses reinsurance to obtain experience with respect to certain new product offerings and to a lesser extent, to mitigate mortality risk for certain protection products and for capital management purposes.

major reinsurance companies account for approximately of the Company s reinsurance recoverables as of September 30, 2024. The Company periodically reviews the financial condition of its reinsurers, amounts recoverable therefrom, and unearned reinsurance premium, in order to reduce its exposure to loss from reinsurer insolvencies. Any expected credit losses are reflected in the current expected credit loss CECL allowance, after considering any collateral the Company obtained in the form of a trust, letter of credit, or funds withheld arrangement. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional details regarding CECL.

Additionally, accumulated net unrealized investment gains (losses) were reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation of ) million and ) million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with a corresponding amount reported in AOCI. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Closed Block has sufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments and there is no expectation that assets outside of the Closed Block will be needed to fund future payments. The excess of Closed Block liabilities over Closed Block assets as of the end of the reporting period shown in the table below is a reasonable measure of the margin in the reported liabilities compared to best estimate liabilities assuming the current dividend scale.

The Company s current and prior effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of primarily due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits, foreign earnings taxed at higher rates than the U.S. statutory rate, and the items discussed below. 
 
 Foreign Tax Credit Regulations. The Treasury Department and the IRS published Final Regulations in the Federal Register (Treasury Decision 9959) on January 4, 2022, which affect the creditability of certain foreign taxes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Final Regulations created uncertainty as to whether a U.S. foreign tax credit could be claimed for taxes paid to Brazil. The ability to claim a foreign tax credit for taxes paid to Brazil impacted the benefit of the election made pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 952 to subject earnings from the Company s insurance operations in Brazil to tax in the U.S. in the tax year earned, net of related foreign tax credits. 
 
 On August 7, 2023, the IRS issued Notice 2023-55 which provided temporary relief to taxpayers in determining whether a foreign tax is eligible for a U.S. foreign tax credit for tax years 2022 and 2023. Subsequently, on December 11, 2023 the IRS issued Notice 2023-80 which extended that relief to taxable years ending before the date that a notice or other guidance

of U.S. statutory rate of of the GILTI amount for that foreign affiliate (the high-tax exception ). These regulations are effective for the 2021 taxable year with an election to apply to any taxable year beginning after 2017. In many of the countries in which the Company operates, including Japan and Brazil, there are differences between local tax rules used to determine the tax base and the U.S. tax principles used to determine GILTI. Also, the Company s Japan affiliates have a different tax year than the U.S. calendar tax year used to determine GILTI; therefore, while many of the countries, including Japan, have a statutory tax rate above the threshold, separate affiliates may not meet the threshold each year and, as such, may not qualify for this annual exclusion. The Company made the high-tax exception election for the 2023 tax year and anticipates making the high-tax exception election for the 2024 tax year for its foreign affiliates that meet the 18.9 threshold. The Company reflected the impact of the election in its full year projected effective tax rate used to calculate year-to-date taxes for the first nine months of 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
 
 Inflation Reduction Act. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Reduction Act ), (House of Representatives, 5376). One of the most significant provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act is a corporate alternative minimum tax CAMT based on the Company s GAAP income, with certain adjustments. This provision, which is applicable only to companies with average applicable financial statement income in excess of 1 billion for any three-year period ending in 2022 or later, is effective in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The impact of the book-income alternative minimum tax, if any, will vary from year to year based on the relationship of the Company s GAAP income to the Company s taxable income. Any tax paid pursuant to this provision is available as a tax credit in future years when the Company s tax rate exceeds the 15 minimum tax threshold. The Company became subject to CAMT beginning in 2023 which may or may not result in a CAMT cash tax liability and will have no impact to the full year effective tax rate.

 Net income (loss) attributable to Prudential Financial available to holders of Common Stock 
 
 Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, earnings attributable to Prudential Financial are allocated between Common Stock and the participating awards, as if the awards were a second class of stock. During periods of net income available to holders of Common Stock, the calculation of earnings per share excludes the income attributable to participating securities in the numerator and the dilutive impact of these securities from the denominator. In the event of a net loss available to holders of Common Stock, undistributed earnings are not allocated to participating securities and the denominator excludes the dilutive impact of these securities as they do not share in the losses of the Company. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as applicable, were based on million and million of such awards, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as applicable, were based on million and million of such awards, respectively, weighted for the period they were outstanding. 
 
 Stock options and shares related to deferred and long-term compensation programs that are considered antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. Stock options are considered antidilutive based on application of the treasury stock method or in the event of a net loss available to holders of Common Stock. Shares related to deferred and long-term compensation programs are considered antidilutive in the event of a net loss available to holders of Common Stock.

The Company anticipates a portion of these commitments will ultimately be funded from its separate accounts. The above amount includes unfunded commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable.

In the normal course of business, the Company may facilitate securities lending or securities repurchase transactions on behalf of certain client accounts (collectively, the accounts ). In certain of these arrangements, the Company has provided an indemnification to the accounts to hold them harmless against losses caused by counterparty (i.e., borrower) defaults associated with such transactions facilitated by the Company. In securities lending transactions, collateral is provided by the counterparty to the accounts at the inception of the transaction in an amount at least equal to of the fair value of the loaned securities and the collateral is maintained daily to equal at least of the fair value of the loaned securities. In securities repurchase transactions, collateral is provided by the counterparty to the accounts at the inception of the transaction in an amount at least equal to of the fair value of the securities subject to repurchase and the collateral is maintained daily to equal at least of the fair value of the securities subject to repurchase. The Company is only at risk if the counterparty to the transaction defaults and the value of the collateral held is less than the value of the securities loaned to, or subject to repurchase from, such counterparty. The Company believes the possibility of any payments under these indemnities is remote.

The change in allowance was a reduction of million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and a reduction of million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 As part of the commercial mortgage activities of the Company s PGIM segment, the Company provides commercial mortgage origination, underwriting and servicing for certain government sponsored entities, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Company has agreed to indemnify the government sponsored entities for a portion of the credit risk associated with certain of the mortgages it services through a delegated authority arrangement. Under these arrangements, the Company originates multi-family mortgages for sale to the government sponsored entities based on underwriting standards they specify, and makes payments to them for a specified percentage share of losses they incur on certain loans serviced by the Company. The Company s percentage share of losses incurred generally varies from to of the loan balance, and is typically based on a first-loss exposure for a stated percentage of the loan balance, plus a shared exposure with the government sponsored entity for any losses in excess of the stated first-loss percentage, subject to a contractually specified maximum percentage. The Company determines the liability related to this exposure using historical loss experience, and the size and remaining life of the asset. The Company serviced million and million of mortgages subject to these loss-sharing arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, all of which are collateralized by first priority liens on the underlying multi-family residential properties. As of September 30, 2024, these mortgages had a weighted-average debt service coverage ratio of times and a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of . As of December 31, 2023, these mortgages had a weighted-average debt service coverage ratio of times and a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of . The Company had losses related to indemnifications that were settled for either the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 
 Accrued liability for other guarantees and indemnifications 
 
 The Company is also subject to other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements. The Company has provided indemnities and guarantees related to acquisitions, dispositions, investments and other transactions that are triggered by, among other things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by the Company. These obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. This includes guarantees issued on billion of standby committed letters of credit and billion of standby uncommitted letters of credit that may be obtained by Prismic Re from third-party financial institutions, for the benefit of PICA as beneficiary, to support U.S. statutory reserve credit related to a reinsurance agreement with PICA. As of September 30, 2024, no letters of credit have been issued to PICA under the facility, and the likelihood of PICA drawing upon them is remote. The guarantees are renewable on an annual basis. The current value of the guarantees is estimated to be immaterial. See Note 20 for additional information on the related party relationship between the Company and Prismic Re and Note 12 for additional information on the Company s reinsurance transactions.

 Overview 
 
 Prudential Financial, a financial services leader with approximately 1.558 trillion of assets under management as of September 30, 2024, has operations primarily in the United States of America U.S. ), Asia, Europe and Latin America. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we offer a wide array of financial products and services, including life insurance, annuities, retirement solutions, mutual funds and investment management. We offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through one of the largest distribution networks in the financial services industry. 
 
 Our principal operations consist of PGIM (our global investment management business), our U.S. Businesses (consisting of our Retirement Strategies, Group Insurance and Individual Life businesses), our International Businesses, the Closed Block division, and our Corporate and Other operations. The Closed Block division is accounted for as a divested business that is reported separately from the Divested and Run-off Businesses that are included in Corporate and Other. Divested and Run-off Businesses consist of businesses that have been, or will be, sold or exited, including businesses that have been placed in wind-down status that do not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). Our Corporate and Other operations include corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments as well as the Divested and Run-off Businesses described above. 
 
 We attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing used by each segment, excluding financing costs associated with corporate debt, which are reflected in our Corporate and Other operations. The net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of capital that management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment. 
 
 Management expects that results will continue to benefit from our mutually-reinforcing business system, which includes a mix of businesses that complement each other to provide competitive advantages, earnings diversification and capital benefits from a balanced risk profile. We believe we are well-positioned to tap into market opportunities to meet the evolving needs of our clients and society at large. Our mix of high-quality protection, retirement and investment management businesses enables us to offer solutions that cover a broad range of financial needs and to engage with our clients through multiple channels. 
 
 In September 2023, we, together with Warburg Pincus and a group of institutional investors, announced the launch of Prismic Life Reinsurance, Ltd. Prismic Re ), a licensed Bermuda-based life and annuity reinsurance company. In conjunction with this announcement, we made an initial equity investment through our Corporate and Other operations of approximately 200 million, equivalent to a 20 interest, in Prismic Life Holding Company LP Prismic ), the Bermuda-exempted limited partnership that owns all of the outstanding capital stock of Prismic Re. We expect the increased reinsurance capacity that this partnership provides to support our vision of expanding access to investing, insurance, and retirement security for people around the world. Our initial transaction, effective September 2023, was to reinsure approximately 9 billion, or 70 , of reserves related to our structured settlement annuities business with Prismic Re. See Note 12 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this transaction. 
 
 As part of our continuous improvement process, we are working to become a leaner and more agile company by simplifying our management structure, empowering our employees with faster decision-making processes and investing in technology and data platforms. We expect these actions will create operating efficiencies, and provide reinvestment capacity to build capabilities, realize additional efficiencies, strengthen our competitiveness and fuel future growth. 

Regulatory Developments 
 
 Retirement Security Rule 
 
 In April 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor DOL adopted a final rule, which had been proposed in October 2023, titled the Retirement Security Rule, and issued final amendments to several prohibited transaction class exemptions PTEs available to investment advice fiduciaries. 
 
 Key aspects of the final rule include, among other things: (1) a broader definition of investment advice fiduciary, which includes financial service providers who give compensated investment advice to individual retirement account owners, participants in workplace plans such as 401(k)s, and plan officials responsible for administering plans and managing plan assets; and (2) when relying on the amended PTEs, the requirement to comply with various conditions such as providing clients with certain information about their investment recommendations and complying with a best interest standard of care. The amended PTEs allow fiduciaries to engage in certain transactions that would otherwise be prohibited, provided they meet certain conditions designed to protect retirement investors.

 The final rule and amended PTEs were scheduled to become effective in September 2024, with a one-year phase in period for certain conditions of the amended PTEs; however, there are pending legal challenges to the rule which could, among other things, delay its implementation in whole or in part. In July 2024, two United States District Courts issued orders staying the effective date of the rule during the pendency of the suits and any appeals. 

Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment 
 
 As a global financial services company, market interest rates are a key driver of our liquidity and capital positions, cash flows, results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates can affect these in several ways, including favorable or adverse impacts to: 
 
 investment-related activity, including: investment income returns, net investment spread results, new money rates, mortgage loan prepayments and bond redemptions; 
 the valuation of fixed income investments and derivative instruments; 
 collateral posting requirements, hedging costs and other risk mitigation activities; 
 customer account values and assets under management, including their impacts on fee-related income; 
 insurance reserve levels, including market risk benefits MRBs ), and market experience true-ups; 
 policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity; 
 product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and 
 the fair value of, and possible impairments on, intangible assets such as goodwill. 
 
 For additional information regarding interest rate risks, see Risk Factors Market Risk included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 See below for a discussion of the current interest rate environment and its impact to net investment spread in our U.S. and Japanese operations along with the composition of their insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances. 
 
 U.S. Operations excluding the Closed Block Division 
 
 While interest rates in the U.S. have experienced a sustained period of historically low levels, rates increased throughout 2022 and have continued to sustain higher levels through the first nine months of 2024, and our average reinvestment yield is generally now exceeding our current average portfolio yield. 
 
 In order to manage the impacts that changes in interest rates have on our net investment spread, we employ a proactive asset/liability management program, which includes strategic asset allocation and hedging strategies within a disciplined risk management framework. These strategies seek to match the liability characteristics of our products, and to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities. Our asset/liability management program also helps manage duration gaps, currency and other risks between assets and liabilities through the use of derivatives. We adjust this dynamic process as products change, as customer behavior changes and as changes in the market environment occur. As a result, our asset/liability management process has permitted us to manage the interest rate risk associated with our products through several market cycles. Our interest rate exposure is also mitigated by our business mix, which includes lines of business for which fee-based and insurance underwriting earnings play a more prominent role in product profitability. We also regularly examine our product offerings and their profitability. As a result, we may reprice certain products and discontinue sales of other products that do not meet our profit expectations. 
 
 The p ortion of the general account supporting our U.S. Businesses and our Corporate and Other operations has approximatel y 217 billion of fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans (based on net carrying value) as of September 30, 2024, with an average portfolio yield of approximately 4.9 . For this portion of the general account attributable to these operations, we estimate annual principal payments and prepayments that we would be required to reinvest to be approximat ely 6.1 of th e fixed maturity security and commercial mortgage loan portfolios through 2025. 
 
 Included in the 217 billion of fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans are approximately 179 billion that are subject to call or redemption features at the issuer s option and have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5 . Of this 179 billion, approximately 52 contain provisions for prepa yment premiums. Future operating results will be impacted by (i) the reinves tment of scheduled payments or prepayments (not subject to a prepayment fee) at different rates compared to the current portfolio yield, including in some cases at rates below those guaranteed under our insurance contracts, and (ii) our utilization of other asset/liability management strategies, as described above, in order to maintain favorable net investment spread.

 The following table sets forth the insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances of our U.S. operations excluding the Closed Block Division, b y type, for the date indicated: 
 As of 
 September 30, 2024 
 (in billions) Long-duration insurance products with fixed and guaranteed terms 197 Contracts with adjustable crediting rates subject to guaranteed minimums 37 Participating contracts where investment income risk ultimately accrues to contractholders 1 Total 235 
 
 The 197 billion above relates to long-duration products such as group annuities, structured settlements and other insurance products that have fixed and guaranteed terms. We seek to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on these contracts through asset/liability management, as discussed above. 
 
 The 37 billion above relates to contracts with crediting rates that may be adjusted over the life of the contract, subject to guaranteed minimums. Although we may have the ability to lower crediting rates for those contracts above guaranteed minimums, our willingness to do so may be limited by competitive pressures. For additional information regarding contracts with adjustable crediting rates subject to guaranteed minimums, see Note 10 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The remaining 1 billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances in these operations relates to participating contracts for which the investment income risk is expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. The crediting rates for these contracts are periodically adjusted based on the return earned on the related assets. 
 
 Closed Block Division 
 
 Substantially all of the 50 billion of general account assets in the Closed Block division support obligations and liabilities relating to the Closed Block policies only. See Note 13 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Closed Block. 
 
 Japanese Operations 
 
 Japan has experienced a low interest rate environment for many years, during which the Bank of Japan s monetary policy has resulted in even lower and, at times, negative yields for certain tenors of government bonds; however, recent actions by the Bank of Japan have resulted in an increase in interest rates in the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 In order to manage, to the extent possible, the impact that the current interest rate environment has on our net investment spread, our Japanese operations employ a proactive asset/liability management program. We continue to purchase long-term bonds with tenors of 10 years or greater. We also regularly examine our product offerings and their profitability. As a result, we may reprice certain products, adjust commissions for certain products and discontinue sales of other products that do not meet our profit expectations. Additionally, our diverse product portfolio in terms of currency mix and premium payment structure allows us to further manage any impacts from changes in the interest rate environment. For additional information regarding sales within these operations, see International Businesses Sales Results, below. 
 
 The portion of the general account supporting our Japanese operations has approximately 155 billion of fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans (based on net carrying value) as of September 30, 2024, with an average portfolio yield of approximately 3.0 . Our Japanese operations have continued to invest in U.S. dollar-denominated assets supporting our U.S. dollar-denominated product portfolio, which has now driven average reinvestment rates to exceed current average portfolio rates. For this portion of the general account attributable to these operations, we estimate annual principal payments and prepayments that we would be required to reinvest to be approximately 5.1 of the fixed maturity security and commercial mortgage loan portfolios through 2025. 
 
 Included in the 155 billion of fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans are approximately 13 billion that are subject to call or redemption features at the issuer s option and have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4 . Of this 13 billion, approximately 7 contain provisions for prepayment premiums. Future operating results will be impacted by (i) the reinvestment of scheduled payments or prepayments (not subject to a prepayment fee) at different rates compared to the current portfolio yield, including in some cases at rates below those guaranteed under our insurance contracts, and (ii) our

 utilization of other asset/liability management strategies, as described above, in order to maintain favorable net investment spread. 
 
 The following table sets forth the insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances of our Japanese operations, by type, for the date indicated: 
 
 As of 
 September 30, 2024 
 (in billions) Insurance products with fixed and guaranteed terms 119 Contracts with a market value adjustment if canceled before maturity 
 35 Contracts with adjustable crediting rates subject to guaranteed minimums 9 Total 163 
 
 The 119 billion primarily consists of long-duration insurance products that have fixed and guaranteed terms for which underlying assets may have to be reinvested at interest rates that are lower than current portfolio yields. The remaining insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances include 35 billion related to contracts that impose a market value adjustment i f the contracts are canceled before maturity and 9 billion rela ted to contracts with crediting rates that may be adjusted over the life of the contract, subject to guaranteed minimums. Most of the current crediting rates on these contracts, however, are at or near contractual minimums. Although we have the ability in some cases to lower crediting rates for those contracts that are above guaranteed minimum crediting rates, the majority of t his business has interest crediting rates that are determined by formula. See Note 10 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding crediting rates on policyholder account balances.

Segment results for the period presented above reflect the following: 

PGIM. Results for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 increased in comparison to the prior year periods, primarily reflecting higher net asset management fees and net other related revenues. The increase for the first nine months of 2024 was partially offset by higher expenses. 

Retireme nt Strategies. Results for the third quarter of 2024 increased in comparison to the prior year period, driven by higher net investment spread results and more favorable reserve experience, partially offset by higher expenses and lower net fee income. Results for the first nine months of 2024 increased in comparison to the prior year period, inclusive of a favorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. Excluding this item, results increased, primarily driven by higher net investment spread results, partially offset by higher expenses and lower net fee income .

 Group Insurance. Results for the third quarter of 2024 decreased in comparison to the prior year period, primarily driven by higher expenses, partially offset by higher net investment spread results. Results for the first nine months of 2024 decreased in comparison to the prior year period, inclusive of a less favorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. Excluding this item, results increased, primarily driven by higher underwriting results and higher net investment spread results, partially offset by higher expenses. 

Individual Life. Results for the third quarter of 2024 increased in comparison to the prior year period, primarily reflecting a favorable impact from the first quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction with Somerset Reinsurance Ltd.

Closed Block Division. Results for the third quarter of 2024 remained unchanged while results for the first nine months of 2024 decreased in comparison to the prior year periods. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in dividends to policyholders, partially offset by higher net investment activity results. 

Segment Measures 
 
 Adjusted Operating Income. In managing our business, we analyze our segments operating performance using adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income does not equate to Income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of joint ventures and other operating entities or Net income (loss) as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP but is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and, consistent with authoritative guidance, is our measure of segment performance. The adjustments to derive adjusted operating income are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies; however, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. 
 
 See Note 19 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the presentation of segment results and our definition of adjusted operating income. 
 
 Annualized New Business Premiums. In managing our Individual Life, Group Insurance and International Businesses segments, we analyze annualized new business premiums, which do not correspond to revenues under U.S. GAAP. Annualized new business premiums measure the current sales performance of the business, while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency of policies written in prior years and net investment income, in addition to current sales. Annualized new business premiums include 10 of first year premiums or deposits from single-payment products in our Individual Life and International Businesses segments. No other adjustments are made for limited-payment contracts. 
 
 The amount of annualized new business premiums for any given period can be significantly impacted by several factors, including but not limited to: addition of new products, discontinuation of existing products, changes in credited interest rates for certain products and other product modifications, changes in premium rates, changes in tax laws, changes in regulations or changes in the competitive environment. Sales volume may increase or decrease prior to certain of these changes becoming effective, and then fluctuate in the other direction following such changes.

Table of Contents 

 Assets Under Management. In managing our PGIM segment, we analyze assets under management (which do not correspond directly to U.S. GAAP assets) because the principal source of revenues is fees based on assets under management. Assets under management represent the fair market value or account value of assets that we manage directly for institutional clients, retail clients, and for our general account, as well as assets invested in our products that are managed by third-party managers. 
 
 Account Values. In managing our Retirement Strategies segment, we analyze account values, which do not correspond directly to U.S. GAAP assets. Net additions (withdrawals) in our Institutional Retirement Strategies business and sales (redemptions) in our Individual Retirement Strategies business do not correspond to revenues under U.S. GAAP but are used as a relevant measure of business activity. 

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 
 Foreign currency exchange rate movements and related hedging strategies 
 
 As a U.S.-based company with significant business operations outside the U.S., particularly in Japan, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate movements that could impact our U.S. dollar USD )-equivalent shareholder return on equity. We seek to mitigate this impact through various hedging strategies, including holding USD-denominated assets in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. 
 
 In order to reduce equity volatility from foreign currency exchange rate movements, we primarily utilize a yen hedging strategy that calibrates the hedge level to preserve the relative contribution of our yen-based business to the Company s overall return on equity on a leverage neutral basis. We implement this hedging strategy utilizing a variety of instruments, including USD-denominated assets and dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments held locally in our Japanese insurance subsidiaries. The total hedge level may vary based on our periodic assessment of the relative contribution of our yen-based business to the Company s overall return on equity. 
 
 The table below presents the aggregate amount of instruments that serve to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange movements on our USD-equivalent shareholder return on equity from our Japanese insurance subsidiaries as of the dates indicated. 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (in billions) Foreign currency hedging instruments: USD-denominated assets associated with yen-based entities(1) 6.2 7.2 Dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments(2) 0.3 0.3 Total foreign currency hedges 6.5 7.5 
 __________ 
 (1) Includes USD-denominated fixed maturities at amortized cost plus any related accrued investment income, as well as USD notional amount of foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding. Note this amount represents only those USD assets serving to hedge the impact of foreign currency volatility on equity. Separate from this program, our Japanese operations also have 86.4 billion and 80.0 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of USD-denominated assets supporting USD-denominated liabilities related to USD-denominated products. 
 (2) Dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments are held by our yen-based entities in the form of fixed maturities and loans with a yen-denominated principal component and USD-denominated interest income. The amounts shown represent the present value of future USD-denominated cash flows. 
 
 The USD-denominated investments that hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on USD-equivalent shareholder return on equity from our Japanese insurance operations are reported within yen-based entities and, as a result, foreign currency exchange rate movements will impact their value reported within our yen-based Japanese insurance entities. We seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will decrease the value of these USD-denominated investments reported within our yen-based Japanese insurance entities, and therefore negatively impact their equity and regulatory solvency margins, by having our Japanese insurance operations enter into currency hedging transactions with a subsidiary of Prudential Financial. These hedging strategies have the economic effect of moving the change in value of these USD-denominated investments due to foreign currency exchange rate movements from our Japanese yen-based entities to our USD-based entities. 
 
 These USD-denominated investments also pay a coupon which is generally higher than what a similar yen-denominated investment would pay. The incremental impact of this higher yield on our USD-denominated investments, as well as our dual 
 109 

Table of Contents 

 currency and synthetic dual currency investments, will vary over time, and is dependent on the duration of the underlying investments as well as interest rate environments in both the U.S. and Japan at the time of the investments. 
 
 Impact of intercompany foreign currency exchange rate arrangements on segment results of operations 
 
 The financial results of our International Businesses and PGIM reflect the impact of intercompany arrangements with our Corporate and Other operations pursuant to which these segments non-USD-denominated earnings are translated at fixed currency exchange rates that are predetermined during the third quarter of the prior year using forward currency exchange rates. Results of our Corporate and Other operations include differences between the translation adjustments recorded by the segments at the fixed currency exchange rate versus the actual average rate during the period. 
 
 In addition, specific to our International Businesses where we hedge certain currencies utilizing forward currency contracts with third-parties, the results of our Corporate and Other operations also include the impact of any gains or losses recorded from these contracts that settled during the period, which include the impact of any over or under hedging of actual earnings that differ from projected earnings. 
 
 The table below presents, for the periods indicated, the increase (decrease) to revenues and adjusted operating income for our International Businesses, PGIM and Corporate and Other operations, reflecting the impact of these intercompany arrangements.

 __________ 
 (1) Represents the difference between non-USD-denominated earnings translated on the basis of weighted average monthly currency exchange rates versus fixed currency exchange rates determined in connection with the foreign currency income hedging program. 
 (2) As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the total notional amounts of these forward currency contracts within our Corporate and Other operations were 0.8 billion and 0.9 billion, respectively. 
 
 Impact of products denominated in non-local currencies on U.S. GAAP earnings 
 
 While our international insurance operations offer products denominated in local currency, several also offer products denominated in non-local currencies. This is most notable in our Japanese operations, which currently offer primarily USD-denominated products, but have also historically offered Australian dollar AUD )-denominated products. The non-local currency-denominated insurance liabilities related to these products are supported by investments denominated in corresponding currencies, including a significant portion designated as available-for-sale. While the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements on these non-local currency-denominated assets and liabilities is economically matched, differences in the accounting for changes in the value of these assets and liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements have historically resulted in volatility in U.S. GAAP earnings. 
 
 As a result, we implemented a structure in Gibraltar Life s operations that disaggregated the USD- and AUD-denominated businesses into separate divisions, each with its own functional currency that aligns with the underlying products and investments. The result of this alignment was to reduce differences in the accounting for changes in the value of these assets and liabilities that arise due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements. For the USD- and AUD-denominated assets that were transferred under this structure, the net cumulative unrealized investment gains associated with foreign exchange remeasurement that were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) AOCI totaled 1.1 billion and 1.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and will be recognized in earnings

 within Realized investment gains (losses), net over time as these assets mature or are sold. Absent the sale of any of these assets prior to their stated maturity, approximately 5 of the 1.1 billion balance as of September 30, 2024 will be recognized throughout the remainder of 2024, approximately 3 will be recognized in 2025, and the remaining balance will be recognized from 2026 through 2051. 
 
 Highly inflationary economies 
 
 Our insurance operations in Argentina, Prudential of Argentina POA ), have historically utilized the Argentine peso as the functional currency given it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. During 2018, Argentina experienced a cumulative inflation rate that exceeded 100 over a 3-year period. As a result, Argentina s economy was deemed to be highly inflationary, resulting in reporting changes effective July 1, 2018. Under U.S. GAAP, the financial statements of a foreign entity in a highly inflationary economy are to be remeasured as if its functional currency (formerly the Argentine peso) is the reporting currency of its parent reporting entity (the USD) on a prospective basis. While this changed how the results of POA are remeasured and/or translated into USD, the impact to our financial statements was not material given the relative size of our POA operations. As discussed further in International Businesses below, in March 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell POA and has transferred these operations into the Divested and Run-off Businesses that are included within our Corporate and Other operations. The transaction was completed in May 2024. 
 
 Enterprise Group, our strategic investment in Ghana, has historically utilized the Ghanaian cedi as its functional currency given it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Ghana experienced a cumulative inflation rate that exceeded 100 over a 3-year period. As a result, Ghana s economy was deemed to be highly inflationary, which requires the results of our investment in Enterprise Group to be remeasured in USD, effective January 1, 2024, as per the U.S. GAAP requirements described above. The impact to our financial statements was not material nor is it expected to have a material impact to our financial statements in future periods given the relative size of the investment. 

Accounting Policies Pronouncements 
 
 Application of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management, on an ongoing basis, reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company s financial statements. If management determines that modifications to assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, the Company s results of operations and financial position as reported in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements could change significantly. 
 
 Management believes the accounting policies relating to the following areas are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments: 
 
 Insurance liabilities; 
 Goodwill; 
 Valuation of investments including derivatives, measurement of allowance for credit losses, and recognition of other-than-temporary impairments OTTI 
 Pension and other postretirement benefits; 
 Taxes on income; and 
 Reserves for contingencies, including reserves for losses in connection with unresolved legal matters. 
 
 Market Performance - Equity and Interest Rate Assumptions 
 
 The liability for future policy benefits for certain of our universal life type products includes quarterly adjustments for the impact of changes to our estimate of future rates of returns on investments to reflect actual fund performance and market conditions. A portion of the returns on investments for our variable life contracts are dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options. This rate of return influences the fees we earn and expected claims to be paid on variable life contracts, as well as other sources of profit. Returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances, which increase the future fees we expect to earn on variable life contracts and decrease expected claims to be paid on variable life contracts. The opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations. 
 
 The weighted average rate of return assumptions used in developing estimated market returns consider many factors specific to each product type, including asset durations, asset allocations and other factors. With regard to equity market 
 111 

Table of Contents 

 assumptions, the near-term future rate of return assumption used in evaluating liabilities for future policy benefits for certain of our products, primarily our domestic and international variable life insurance products, is generally updated each quarter and is derived using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. Under this approach, we consider historical equity returns and adjust projected equity returns over an initial future period of five years (the near-term so that equity returns converge to the long-term expected rate of return. If the near-term projected future rate of return is greater than our near-term maximum future rate of return of 15.0 , we use our maximum future rate of return. If the near-term projected future rate of return is lower than our near-term minimum future rate of return of 0 , we use our minimum future rate of return. As of September 30, 2024, our domestic variable life insurance businesses assume an 8.0 long-term equity expected rate of return and a 2.7 near-term mean reversion equity expected rate of return, and our international variable life insurance business assumes a 5.0 long-term equity expected rate of return and a 0.6 near-term mean reversion equity expected rate of return. 
 
 With regard to interest rate assumptions used in evaluating liabilities for future policy benefits for certain of our products, we update the long-term and near-term future rates used to project fixed income returns annually and quarterly, respectively. As a result of our 2024 annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, we increased our long-term expectation of both the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate and 10-year Japanese Government Bond yield by 25 basis points, and now grade to rates of 3.50 and 1.25 , respectively, over ten years. As part of our quarterly market experience updates, we update our near-term projections of interest rates to reflect changes in current rates. 
 
 For further discussion of impacts that could result from changes in these key estimates and assumptions, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Application of Critical Accounting Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 (2) Includes mortgage origination revenues from our commercial mortgage origination and servicing business. 
 
 Three Month Comparison. Revenues increased 45 million. Asset management fees increased, primarily reflecting equity market appreciation, the impact of lower interest rates and strong investment performance, as well as the impact of the Deerpath acquisition. Other related revenues were favorable, primarily reflecting higher commercial mortgage origination revenues driven by higher loan production, as well as higher seed and co-investments results driven by strong investment performance, partially offset by lower incentive fees. These increases were partially offset by lower service, distribution and other revenues, primarily reflecting lower revenues from certain consolidated funds (which were fully offset by lower expenses related to noncontrolling interests in these funds). 
 
 Expenses increased 15 million, primarily reflecting higher compensation expenses due to business growth, including the impact of the Deerpath acquisition, and increases related to certain long-term employee compensation plans tied to investment performance. These increases were partially offset by lower operating expenses. Variable expenses were relatively flat, reflecting an increase in overall segment earnings offset by lower revenues from certain consolidated funds, as discussed above. 
 
 Nine Month Comparison. Revenues increased 251 million. Asset management fees increased, primarily reflecting equity market appreciation and strong investment performance, as well as the impact of the Deerpath acquisition. Other related revenues were favorable, primarily reflecting higher incentive fees due to the impact of the Deerpath acquisition and strong investment performance, higher commercial mortgage origination revenues driven by higher loan production, and higher seed and co-investments results driven by strong investment performance. 
 
 Expenses increased 176 million, primarily reflecting higher compensation expenses due to business growth, including the impact of the Deerpath acquisition, and increases related to certain long-term employee compensation plans tied to investment performance.

 Three Month Comparison. Adjusted operating income for our U.S. Businesses increased by 20 million primarily due to: 
 
 Higher underwriting results, primarily reflecting favorable mortality experience and the impact of the first quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction of certain guaranteed universal life policies in our Individual Life business; and 
 
 Higher net investment spread results, primarily reflecting higher reinvestment rates and business growth, partially offset by lower income on non-coupon investments and the impact of assets transferred as part of the first quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction, as discussed above. 
 
 Partially offsetting these increases were: 
 
 Higher expenses, primarily driven by higher operating expenses in our Group Insurance and Institutional Retirement Strategies businesses and higher amortization of acquisition costs in our Individual Retirement Strategies business driven by business growth. 
 
 Nine Month Comparison. Adjusted operating income for our U.S. Businesses increased by 213 million primarily due to:

 Adjusted operating income from our Individual Retirement Strategies business increased 26 million, primarily driven by higher net investment spread results due to growth in indexed variable annuities and higher reinvestment rates. This increase was partially offset by higher amortization costs as well as lower fee income, net of distribution expenses , resulting from lower average separate account values due to net outflows partially offset by favorable equity markets. 
 
 Nine Month Comparison . Adjusted operating income from our Institutional Retirement Strategies business increased 166 million, including a favorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. Results for 2024 and 2023 included net benefits from this update of 132 million and 6 million, respectively. Excluding this item, adjusted operating income increased 40 million, driven by higher net investment spread results, primarily reflecting business growth and higher reinvestment rates, partially offset by lower income on non-coupon investments. This increase was partially offset by higher operating expenses.

 Account Values 
 
 Institutional Retire ment Strategies. Account values are a significant driver of our operating results and are primarily driven by net additions (withdrawals) and the impact of market changes. The investment income and interest we credit to policyholders on our spread-based products varies with the level of general account values. The income we earn on most of our fee-based products varies with the level of fee-based account values as many policy fees are determined by these values. 
 
 The following table shows the changes in the account values of Institutional Retirement Strategies products for the periods indicated. Account values include both internally- and externally-managed client balances as the total balances drive revenue for the Institutional Retirement Strategies business. For additional information regarding internally-managed balances, see PGIM.

 (1) Beginning total account values, net, were 264,999 million and 258,533 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, 258,417 million and 251,818 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 245,660 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 (2) Additions primarily include: group annuities and funded pension reinsurance calculated based on premiums received; international longevity reinsurance contracts calculated as the present value of future projected benefits; investment-only stable value contracts calculated as the fair value of customers funds held in a client-owned trust; and funding agreements issued calculated based on premiums received. 
 (3) Other activity includes the effect of foreign exchange rate changes associated with our British pounds sterling denominated international reinsurance business and changes in asset balances for externally-managed accounts. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Other activity also includes 865 million in receipts offset by 736 million in payments and 1,109 million in receipts offset by 788 million in payments, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, includes 2,548 million in receipts offset by 2,587 million in payments and 2,818 million in receipts offset by 2,559 million in payments, respectively, related to funding agreements backed by commercial paper that typically have maturities of less than 90 days. 
 
 The increases in Institutional Retirement Strategies net account values for the three months, nine months and twelve months ended September 30, 2024 reflect net additions primarily driven by significant pension risk transfer transactions, including funded pension risk transfer and international reinsurance sales, the positive impact of foreign exchange rate changes, and an increase in the market values of assets and interest credited on customer funds. 
 
 Individual Retirement Strategies. Account values are a significant driver of our operating results. Since most fees are determined by the level of separate account assets, fee income varies primarily based on the level of account values. Account values are driven by net flows from new business sales, surrenders, withdrawals and benefit payments, policy charges and the impact of positive or negative market value changes. The following table sets forth account value information of Individual Retirement Strategies products for the periods indicated:

 Individual Retirement Strategies sales, net of full surrenders and death benefits, for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased in comparison to the prior year period driven by higher sales of indexed variable and fixed annuities products, partially offset by higher full surrenders. 
 
 The increase in Individual Retirement Strategies net account values for the three months, nine months and twelve months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by market value appreciation, partially offset by policy charges on contractholder accounts and net outflows. 
 
 Risks and Risk Mitigants 
 
 The following is a summary of certain risks associated with Individual Retirement Strategies products, certain strategies in mitigating those risks including any updates to those strategies since the previous year-end, and the related financial results. 
 
 Fixed Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposure of our fixed annuity products relates to investment risks we bear for providing customers a minimum guaranteed interest rate or an index-linked interest rate required to be credited to the customer s account value, which include interest rate fluctuations and/or sustained periods of low interest rates, and credit risk related to the underlying investments. We manage these risk exposures primarily through our investment strategies and product design features, which include credit rate resetting subject to the minimum guaranteed interest rate as well as surrender charges applied during the early years of the contract that help to provide protection for premature withdrawals. In addition, a portion of our fixed products has a market value adjustment provision that affords protection of lapse in the case of rising interest rates. We also manage these risk exposures through external reinsurance for certain of our fixed annuity products. For additional information regarding our external reinsurance agreements, see Note 12 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Indexed Variable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposure of our indexed variable annuity products relates to the investment risks we bear in order to credit to the customer s account balance the required crediting rate based on the performance of the elected indices at the end of each term. We manage this risk primarily through our investment strategies and product design features, which include credit rate resetting subject to contractual minimums as well as surrender charges applied during the early years of the contract that help to provide protection for premature withdrawals. In addition, our indexed variable annuity strategies have an interim value provision that provides some protection from lapse in the case of rising interest rates.

 Variable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including capital markets assumptions such as equity market returns, interest rates and market volatility, along with actuarial assumptions such as contractholder mortality, the timing and amount of annuitization and withdrawals, and contract lapses. For these risk exposures, achievement of our expected returns is subject to the risk that actual experience will differ from the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products. We manage our exposure to certain risks driven by fluctuations in capital markets primarily through a combination of i) Product Design Features, and ii) our Asset Liability Management Strategy, as discussed below. We also manage these risk exposures through external reinsurance for certain of our variable annuity products. Effective April 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with AuguStar to reinsure approximately 10 billion of account values of PDI traditional variable annuity contracts with guaranteed living benefits. For additional information regarding our external reinsurance agreements, see Note 12 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 i. Product Design Features: 
 
 A portion of the variable annuity contracts that we offered include an automatic rebalancing feature, also referred to as an asset transfer feature. This feature is implemented at the contract level, and transfers assets between certain variable investment sub-accounts selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, a fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond fund sub-account within the separate accounts. The objective of the automatic rebalancing feature is to reduce our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility. Other product design features we utilize include, among others, asset allocation restrictions, minimum issuance age requirements and certain limitations on the amount of purchase payments, as well as a required minimum allocation to our general account for certain of our products. In addition, there is diversity in our fee arrangements, as certain fees are primarily based on the benefit guarantee amount, the contractholder account value and/or premiums, which helps preserve certain revenue streams when market fluctuations cause account values to decline. 
 
 ii. Asset Liability Management ALM Strategy (including fixed income instruments and derivatives): 
 
 We employ an ALM strategy that utilizes a combination of both traditional fixed income instruments and derivatives to meet expected liabilities associated with our annuity guarantees that under U.S . GAAP are considere d MRBs. The MRB liability that we hedge consists of expected living and death benefit c laims under various market conditions, which are managed using fixed income instruments, derivatives, or a combination thereof. For our PDI variable annuity, we utilize fixed income instruments to meet expected liabilities. For the portion of our ALM strategy executed with derivatives, we enter into a range of exchange-traded and over-the-counter OTC equity, interest rate and credit derivatives, including, but not limited to: equity and treasury futures; total return, credit default and interest rate swaps; and options including equity options, swaptions, and floors and caps. The intent of this strategy is to more efficiently manage the capital and liquidity associated with these products while continuing to mitigate fluctuations in net income due to mo vements in capital markets. To achieve this, we periodically review and recalibrate the ALM strategy by optimizing the mix of derivatives and fixed income instruments to achieve expected outcomes. As part of our periodic review of our variable annuities ALM strategy, and in accordance with our Risk Appetite Framework RAF ), the Company simplified its hedging approach in the first quarter of 2023 and collapsed the aggregate amount of equity hedging into one program. 
 
 Under our ALM strategy, we expect differences in the U.S. GAAP net income impact between the changes in value of the fixed income instruments (either designated as available-for-sale or designated as trading) and derivatives as compared to the changes in the MRB liability these assets support. These differences can be primarily attribut ed to two distinct areas: 
 
 Different accounting treatment between liabilities and assets supporting those liabilities . Under U.S. GAAP, changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments and fixed income instruments designated as trading, and MRBs, excluding the changes in the Company s non-performance risk NPR spreads, are immediately reflected in net income, while changes in the fair value of fixed income instruments that are designated as available-for-sale are recorded as unrealized gains (losses) in other comprehensive income. 
 
 General hedge results. For the derivative portion of the ALM strategy, the net hedging impact (the extent to which the changes in value of the hedging instruments offset the change in value of the portion of the MRBs we are hedging) may be impacted by a number of factors, including: cash flow timing differences between our hedging instruments and the corresponding portion of the MRBs we are hedging, basis differences attributable to actual underlying contractholder funds to be hedged versus hedgeable indices, rebalancing costs related to dynamic rebalancing of hedging instruments as markets move, certain elements of the MRBs that may not be hedged (including certain actuarial assumptions), and implied and realized market volatility on the hedge positions relative to the portion of the MRBs we seek to hedge.

 (3) Represents the change in the liability for our fixed and variable indexed annuities, which is measured utilizing a valuation methodology required under U.S. GAAP. The total GAAP liability includes the fair value of all index credits for the current term and all future projected renewals of the policy; however, only changes in the fair value of the current term elected by the policyholder are included in adjusted operating income, while changes in the fair value of all future projected renewals of the policy are excluded from adjusted operating income. 
 (4) Represents the change in fair value of the derivatives utilized to hedge potential claims associated with our variable annuity living and death benefit guarantees. 
 (5) Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 include changes in the fair value of equity derivatives related to the capital hedge program of (225) million that were intended to protect a portion of the overall capital position of the variable annuities business against its exposure to the equity markets. The capital hedge program was discontinued in the first quarter of 2023. 
 (6) Includes the changes in duration swaps, deferred policy acquisition costs DAC amortization, trading gains or losses, and other activity. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the loss of 516 million was primarily driven by the net impact of lower interest rates on MRBs and other liabilities, net of hedging, partially offset by favorable equity market performance. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the loss of 650 million was primarily driven by realized losses on asset sales, and the impact of higher interest rates on derivatives.

 Adjusted Operating Income 
 
 Three Month Comparison . Adjusted operating income decreased 7 million, primarily reflecting higher operating and variable expenses, largely supporting business growth, partially offset by higher net investment spread results driven by higher reinvestment rates. Underwriting results in our group disability business were lower, reflecting less favorable claims experience on long-term and short-term disability contracts, partially offset by an increase in supplemental health product sales. This impact was mostly offset by higher underwriting results in our group life business driven by more favorable mortality experience.

Table of Contents 

 Nine Month Comparison . Adjusted operating income decreased 5 million, including a less favorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. Results for 2024 and 2023 included net benefits from this update of 25 million and 36 million, respectively. Excluding this item, adjusted operating income increased 6 million, primarily reflecting higher underwriting results in our group life business driven by more favorable mortality experience, and higher net investment spread results driven by higher reinvestment rates. These increases were partially offset by higher operating and variable expenses, largely supporting business growth. 
 
 Revenues, Benefits and Expenses 
 
 Three Month Comparison. Revenues increased 67 million, primarily reflecting higher premiums and policy charges and fee income driven by lower premium returns on experience-rated contracts in our group life business due to less favorable mortality, with offsets in policyholders benefits and changes in reserves, as discussed below. 
 
 Benefits and expenses increased 74 million, primarily reflecting the impact of higher mortality on experience-rated contracts in our group life business, as discussed above, less favorable claims experience on long-term and short-term disability contracts, and higher general and administrative expenses, largely supporting business growth. 
 
 Nine Month Comparison. Revenues increased 125 million. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, revenues increased 128 million. The increase primarily reflected higher premiums and policy charges and fee income, driven by business growth in our group disability business, including supplemental health products, and higher net investment income driven by higher reinvestment rates. 
 
 Benefits and expenses increased 130 million. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, benefits and expenses increased 122 million. The increase primarily reflected higher policyholders benefits, driven by less favorable claims experience on long-term disability contracts, as well as higher general and administrative expenses, largely supporting business growth. 
 
 Sales Results

 __________ 
 (1) Amounts exclude new premiums resulting from rate changes on existing policies, from additional coverage under our Servicemembers Group Life Insurance contract and from excess premiums on group universal life insurance that build cash value but do not purchase face amounts. 
 
 Total annualized new business premiums for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 32 million compared to the prior year period, driven by lower sales in both our group life and group disability businesses primarily in the National Market segment reflecting the timing of enrollments, partially offset by higher sales in the Association Market segment. 
 
 Total annualized new business premiums for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 16 million compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by higher sales in our group disability business, including an increase in supplemental health product sales in the National Market and Association Market segments. This increase was partially offset by lower sales in the Premier Market segment in both our group disability and group life businesses, reflecting the absence of outsized sales in the prior year period.

 Business Updates 
 
 We have entered into the following two external reinsurance agreements that we expect will reduce, in aggregate, the Company s previously established statutory reserves on its in-force guaranteed universal life block of business by approximately 60 upon completion: 
 
 In July 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with Somerset Re to reinsure certain guaranteed universal life policies issued by Pruco Life Insurance Company Pruco Life and Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey PLNJ ), both of which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Prudential Financial. These policies represented approximately 30 of the Company s statutory reserves on its in-force guaranteed universal life block of business. The transaction was completed in March 2024 with an effective date of January 1, 2024. See Note 12 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 In August 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Wilton Re to reinsure certain guaranteed universal life policies issued by Pruco Life and PLNJ. These policies represent approximately 40 of the Company s remaining statutory reserves on its in-force guaranteed universal life block of business, following the close of the reinsurance transaction with Somerset Re, as discussed above. The transaction is structured on an indemnity coinsurance basis and contains significant structural protections, including overcollateralization by the counterparty and agreed upon investment guidelines, and is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

 Adjusted Operating Income 
 
 Three Month Comparison. Adjusted operating income increased 2 million, primarily driven by higher underwriting results due to favorable mortality experience and the impact of the first quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction of certain guaranteed universal life policies, as discussed above. These increases were partially offset by lower net investment spread results reflecting the impact of assets transferred as part of this reinsurance transaction. 
 
 Nine Month Comparison. Adjusted operating income decreased 45 million, including an unfavorable net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. Results for 2024 included a net charge of 98 million while 2023 included a net charge of 26 million. Excluding this item, adjusted operating income increased 27 million primarily driven by higher underwriting results reflecting favorable mortality experience and the impact from the first quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction, as discussed above. These increases were partially offset by lower net investment spread results reflecting the impact of assets transferred as part of this reinsurance transaction, partially offset by higher reinvestment rates and higher income on non-coupon investments.

 Revenues, Benefits and Expenses 
 
 Three Month Comparison. Revenues decreased 43 million, primarily driven by lower investment results reflecting the ceding of investment results related to the first quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction, as discussed above, partially offset by higher net investment income reflecting higher reinvestment rates. 
 
 Benefits and expenses decreased 45 million, primarily driven by lower policyholders benefits, including changes in reserves, and lower interest credited on policyholders account balances as a result of the first quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher reserve financing costs corresponding to higher net investment income, as discussed above, and higher general and administrative expenses reflecting the absence of a reduction in legal reserves in the prior year period. 
 
 Nine Month Comparison. Revenues decreased 25 million. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, revenues decreased 24 million, primarily driven by lower investment results reflecting the ceding of investment results related to the first quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction, as discussed above. This decrease was partially offset by higher net investment income reflecting higher reinvestment rates and higher income on non-coupon investments, as well as higher policy charges and fee income due to business growth. 
 
 Benefits and expenses increased 20 million. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, benefits and expenses decreased 51 million, primarily driven by lower policyholders benefits, including changes in reserves, and lower interest credited on policyholders account balances as a result of the first quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction discussed above, as well as favorable changes in estimates of the liability for future policy benefits. These decreases were largely offset by higher interest expense due to higher reserve financing costs corresponding to higher net investment income, as discussed above, and higher general and administrative expenses associated with the first quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction, as discussed above, as well as the absence of a reduction in legal reserves in the prior year period.

Effective in the first quarter of 2024, the results of POA and the impact of its sale were reflected in the Divested and Run-off Businesses that are included within our Corporate and Other operations. The transaction, which did not have a material impact on the Company s results, was completed in May 2024. 
 
 Operating Results 
 
 The results of our International Businesses operations are translated on the basis of weighted average monthly exchange rates, inclusive of the effects of the intercompany arrangement discussed in Results of Operations Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates above. To provide a better understanding of operating performance within the International Businesses, where indicated below, we have analyzed our results of operations excluding the effect of the year over year change in foreign currency exchange rates. Our results of operations, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, were derived by translating foreign currencies to USD at uniform exchange rates for all periods presented, including for constant dollar information discussed below. For our Japan operations, we used an exchange rate of 129 yen per USD. In addition, for constant dollar information discussed below, activity denominated in USD is generally reported based on the amounts as transacted in USD. Annualized new business premiums presented on a constant exchange rate basis in the Sales Results section below reflect translation based on these same uniform exchange rates.

 Adjusted Operating Income 
 
 Three Month Comparison. Adjusted operating income from our Life Planner operations decreased 63 million, including a net unfavorable impact of 12 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding this item, adjusted operating income decreased 51 million, primarily reflecting lower underwriting results, driven by the decline of business in force in Japan and unfavorable mortality experience, partially offset by the growth of business in force in Brazil. The decrease also reflects higher variable expenses driven by business growth in Brazil. 
 
 Adjusted operating income from our Gibraltar Life and Other operations increased 18 million, including a net favorable impact of 8 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding this item, adjusted operating income increased 10 million, primarily reflecting higher earnings from joint ventures and other operating entities, higher net investment spread results driven by higher income on non-coupon investments, partially offset by lower underwriting results primarily driven by the decline of business in force in Japan. 
 
 Nine Month Comparison. Adjusted operating income from our Life Planner operations decreased 127 million, including a net unfavorable impact of 34 million from currency fluctuations. Both periods also include the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, which resulted in a 56 million net charge in 2024 compared to a 5 million net charge in 2023. 
 
 Excluding these items, adjusted operating income decreased 42 million, reflecting lower underwriting results, primarily due to the decline in business in force in Japan, partially offset by the growth of business in force in Brazil.

These decreases were partially offset by higher net investment spread results driven by higher reinvestment rates, partially offset by lower income on non-coupon investments. 
 
 Adjusted operating income from our Gibraltar Life and Other operations increased 56 million, including a net favorable impact of 17 million from currency fluctuations. Both periods also include the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, which resulted in a 1 million net benefit in 2024 compared to a 18 million net benefit in 2023. 
 
 Excluding these items, adjusted operating income increased 56 million, primarily reflecting higher earnings from joint ventures and other operating entities, higher net investment spread results, primarily driven by higher income on non-coupon investments, and lower operating expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower underwriting results, driven by the decline of business in force in Japan.

 The following table sets forth annualized new business premiums, as defined under Results of Operations Segment Measures above, on an actual and constant exchange rate basis for the periods indicated:

 The amount of annualized new business premiums and the sales mix, in terms of types and currency denomination of products, for any given period can be significantly impacted by several factors, including but not limited to: the addition of new products, discontinuation of existing products, changes in credited interest rates for certain products and other product modifications, changes in premium rates, changes in interest rates or fluctuations in currency markets, changes in tax laws, changes in life insurance regulations or changes in the competitive environment. Sales volume may increase or decrease prior to certain of these changes becoming effective, and then fluctuate in the other direction following such changes. 
 
 Our diverse product portfolio in Japan, in terms of currency mix and premium payment structure, allows us to adapt to changing market and competitive dynamics, including the low interest rate environment. We regularly examine our product offerings and their related profitability and reprice or discontinue sales of certain products that do not meet our profit expectations. The impact of these actions, coupled with the introduction of certain new products, has generally resulted in an increase in sales of products denominated in USD relative to products denominated in other currencies.

 Long-Term Care 
 
 Three Month Comparison . Results increased 221 million compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting favorable impacts from changes in the market value of equity securities and favorable impacts from changes in the market value of derivatives used for duration management. 
 
 Nine Month Comparison . Results increased 393 million, including a favorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. Results for 2024 included a 111 million net benefit from these updates, while results for 2023 included a 79 million net charge from these updates. Excluding this item, results increased 203 million compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting more favorable impacts from changes in the market value of equity securities and less unfavorable impacts from changes in the market value of derivatives used for duration management. 
 
 Other Divested and Run-off Businesses

Results for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 321 million, primarily reflecting unfavorable results related to the Full Service Retirement business, as discussed above, as well as impairments and charges related to management s decisions to exit AIQ and PGIMW (and their subsequent classifications as divested businesses in the first and second quarter of 2024, respectively). 

Closed Block Division 
 
 The Closed Block division includes certain in-force traditional domestic participating life insurance and annuity products and assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies (collectively the Closed Block ), as well as certain related assets and liabilities. We no longer offer these traditional domestic participating policies. See Note 13 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 Each year, the Board of Directors of The Prudential Insurance Company of America PICA determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the Closed Block, including investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses), mortality experience and other factors. Although the Closed Block experience for dividend action decisions is based upon statutory results, at the time the Closed Block was established, we developed, as required by U.S. GAAP, an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in the Closed Block. Actual cumulative earnings, as required by U.S. GAAP, reflect the recognition of realized 
 135 

Table of Contents 

 investment gains and losses in the current period, as well as changes in assets and related liabilities that support the Closed Block policies. If actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expected, we record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation. Additionally, any accumulated net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the Closed Block are reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation, with a corresponding amount reported in AOCI, while any accumulated net unrealized investment losses are reflected as a reduction of the policyholder dividend obligation, to the extent the overall policyholder dividend obligation is otherwise positive. 
 
 We will subsequently pay this excess to Closed Block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future Closed Block performance that is less favorable than we originally expected. The policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the Closed Block division will include any change in our policyholder dividend obligation that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expected in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the Board of Directors of PICA. If actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods, earnings volatility in the Closed Block division, which is primarily due to changes in investment results, may not be offset by changes in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation. For a discussion of the Closed Block division s realized investment gains (losses), net, see General Account Investments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was 2,470 million, which was recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. Actual cumulative earnings, as required by U.S. GAAP, reflect the recognition of realized investment gains and losses in the current period, as well as changes in assets and related liabilities that support the Closed Block policies. As of September 30, 2024, net unrealized investment losses have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the Closed Block due to the impacts of higher interest rates on the market value of fixed maturities available-for-sale. The impact of these net unrealized investment losses has been reflected as a decrease to the policyholder dividend obligation of 1,067 million at September 30, 2024, with a corresponding amount reported in AOCI. 
 
 Operating Results 
 
 The following table sets forth the Closed Block division s results for the periods indicated:

 Income (loss) Before Income Taxes and Equity in Earnings of Joint Ventures and Other Operating Entities 
 
 Three Month Comparison . Income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of joint ventures and other operating entities remained unchanged. Net investment activity results increased reflecting higher other income primarily driven by favorable changes in the market value of equity and fixed income securities. As a result of these and other factors, a 157 million reduction in the policyholder dividend obligation was recorded in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a 334 million reduction in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Nine Month Comparison. Income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of joint ventures and other operating entities decreased 11 million. Net investment activity results increased, primarily reflecting higher other income driven by more favorable changes in the market value of equity securities, and higher net investment income driven by non-coupon investments, partially offset by higher realized investment losses from the sale of fixed income securities. As a result of these and other factors, a 403 million reduction in the policyholder dividend obligation was recorded in the first nine months of 2024, compared to a 397 million reduction in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Revenues, Benefits and Expenses 
 
 Three Month Comparison . Revenues increased 202 million primarily driven by an increase in other income, as discussed above. 
 136 

Table of Contents 

Benefits and expenses increased 202 million primarily driven by an increase in dividends to policyholders, reflecting less of a reduction in the policyholder dividend obligation due to changes in cumulative earnings and other factors, as discussed above. 
 
 Nine Month Comparison. Revenues increased 49 million primarily driven by an increase in other income and net investment income, partially offset by higher realized investment losses, as discussed above. 
 
 Benefits and expenses increased 60 million primarily driven by an increase in dividends to policyholders, reflecting a higher reduction in the policyholder dividend obligation due to changes in cumulative earnings and other factors, as discussed above.

General Account Investments 
 
 Portfolio Composition 
 
 Our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, policy loans and non-coupon investments, which include equity securities and other invested assets such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies LPs/LLCs ), real estate held through direct ownership, derivative instruments and seed money investments in separate accounts. The composition of our general account reflects, within the discipline provided by our risk management approach, our need for competitive results and the selection of diverse investment alternatives available primarily through our PGIM segment. The size of our portfolio enables us to invest in asset classes that may be unavailable to the typical investor. 
 
 A portion of our general account investments support customer liabilities reinsured under coinsurance with funds withheld and modified coinsurance arrangements. With these reinsurance arrangements, we retain legal ownership of the assets (collectively, the Funds Withheld which remain on our Unaudited Interim Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, while the economic benefits and investment risk associated with the Funds Withheld assets ultimately inure to the reinsurer. The composition of the Funds Withheld assets is subject to investment guidelines specific to the reinsurance treaties, which may differ from the investment guidelines we set for our General Account, excluding Funds Withheld. See Note 12 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our material reinsurance agreements.

 The increase in general account investments attributable to PFI excluding the Closed Block division and Funds Withheld in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to net business inflows and the reinvestment of net investment income, partially offset by the translation impact of the U.S. dollar strengthening against the yen and an increase in Japan interest rates. For information regarding the methodology used in determining the fair value of our fixed maturities, see Note 6 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 43 and 44 , respectively, of our general account investments attributable to PFI excluding the Closed Block division and Funds Withheld related to our Japanese insurance operations. The following table sets forth the composition of the investments of our Japanese insurance operations general account, as of the dates indicated:

 The increase in general account investments related to our Japanese insurance operations in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to the reinvestment of net investment income and net business inflows, partially offset by the translation impact of the U.S. dollar strengthening against the yen and an increase in Japan interest rates. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Japanese insurance operations had 91.6 billion, at carrying value, of investments denominated in U.S. dollars, including 0.8 billion that were hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts and 83.7 billion that support liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars, with the remainder constituting part of the hedging of foreign currency exchange rate exposure to U.S. dollar-equivalent equity. As of December 31, 2023, our Japanese insurance operations had 86.5 billion, at carrying value, of investments denominated in U.S. dollars, including 1.3 billion that were hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts and 77.7 billion that support liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars, with the remainder constituting part of the hedging of foreign currency exchange rate exposure of U.S. dollar-equivalent equity. The 5.1 billion increase in the carrying value of U.S. dollar-denominated investments from December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to reinvestment of net investment income and portfolio growth as a result of net business inflows. 
 
 Our Japanese insurance operations had 3.0 billion and 4.2 billion, at carrying value, of investments denominated in Australian dollars that support liabilities denominated in Australian dollars as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The 1.2 billion decrease in the carrying value of Australian dollar-denominated investments from December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to run-off of the portfolio. For additional information regarding U.S. and Australian dollar investments held in our Japanese insurance operations and a discussion of our yen hedging strategy, see Results of Operations by Segment Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates above.

 Three Month Comparison. The increase in investment income after investment expenses yield attributable to our general account investments excluding the Closed Block division, Funds Withheld and the Japanese insurance operations portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily the result of higher fixed income reinvestment rates. 
 
 The increase in investment income after investment expenses yield attributable to the Japanese insurance operations portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily the result of higher fixed income reinvestment rates. 
 
 Both the U.S. dollar-denominated and Australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts provide a yield that is substantially higher than the yield on comparable yen-denominated fixed maturities. The average amortized cost of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts was approximately 69.2 billion and 61.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed maturities support liabilities that are denominated in U.S. dollars. The average amortized cost of Australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts was approximately 2.8 billion and 4.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of Australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities support liabilities that are denominated in Australian dollars.

 The following analysis reflects realized gains (losses) attributable to PFI excluding Closed Block Division and Funds Withheld. 
 
 Three Month Comparison . Net losses on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities were 32 million for the third quarter of 2024 primarily driven by net losses on sales in a higher interest rate environment, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on U.S. dollar-denominated securities that matured or were sold within our International Businesses. Net losses on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities were 282 million for the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by net losses on sales in a higher interest rate environment, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on U.S. dollar-denominated securities that matured or were sold within our International Businesses. 
 
 Net realized gains on derivative instruments of 12 million for the third quarter of 2024 primarily included: 
 
 554 million of gains on interest rate derivatives due to a decrease in swap and U.S. Treasury rates; 
 28 million of gains on credit default swaps due to spreads tightening; and 
 25 million of gains on Synthetic Guarantees. 
 
 Partially offsetting these gains were: 
 
 495 million of losses on product-related embedded derivatives and related hedge positions; and 
 109 million of losses on foreign currency hedges primarily due to U.S. dollar depreciation versus the euro and British pound. 
 
 Net realized losses on derivative instruments of 2,063 million for the third quarter of 2023 primarily included: 
 
 2,041 million of losses on interest rate derivatives due to increases in swap and U.S. Treasury rates.

These adjustments are made to arrive at Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments, which is excluded from adjusted operating income. See Note 19 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding adjusted operating income and its reconciliation to Income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of joint ventures and other operating entities. The results include changes in the fair value of equity securities and fixed income securities that are designated as trading, settlements and changes in the value of derivatives, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on certain non-local currency denominated assets and liabilities, as well as changes in certain policyholder reserves and other costs. 
 
 Nine Month Comparison . Net losses on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities were 292 million for the first nine months of 2024 primarily driven by net losses on sales in a higher interest rate environment, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on U.S. dollar-denominated securities that matured or were sold within our International Businesses. Net losses on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities were 342 million for the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by net losses on sales in a higher interest rate environment, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on U.S. dollar-denominated securities that matured or were sold within our International Businesses. 
 
 Net realized gains on derivative instruments of 102 million for the first nine months of 2024 primarily included: 
 
 272 million of gains on product-related hedge positions and related embedded derivatives; 
 77 million of gains on credit default swaps due to spreads tightening; 
 76 million of gains on Synthetic Guarantees; and 
 41 million of gains on foreign currency hedges due to U.S. dollar appreciation versus the Brazilian real. 
 
 Partially offsetting these gains were: 
 
 359 million of losses on interest rate derivatives due to increases in U.S. Treasury and Japanese yen swap rates. 
 
 Net realized losses on derivative instruments of 2,412 million for the first nine months of 2023 primarily included: 
 
 1,931 million of losses on interest rate derivatives due to increases in swap and U.S. Treasury rates; and

 These adjustments are made to arrive at Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments, which is excluded from adjusted operating income. See Note 19 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding adjusted operating income and its reconciliation to Income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of joint ventures and other operating entities. The results include changes in the fair value of equity securities and fixed income securities that are designated as trading, settlements and changes in the value of derivatives, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on certain non-local currency denominated assets and liabilities, as well as changes in certain policyholder reserves and other costs. 
 
 Credit Losses 
 
 The level of credit losses generally reflects current and expected economic conditions and is expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve. Historically, the causes of credit losses have been specific to each individual issuer and have not directly resulted in credit losses to other securities within the same industry or geographic region. We may also realize additional credit and interest rate-related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives.

 We maintain separate monitoring processes for public and private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that require special scrutiny and management. For private placements, our credit and portfolio management processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management. We have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish checks and balances for new investments. We apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due diligence for all transactions, whether they originate through our own in-house staff or through agents. Our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions. We set all valuation standards centrally, and we assess the fair value of all investments quarterly. Our public and private fixed maturity investment managers formally review all public and private fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances and/or company or industry-specific concerns. 
 
 For LPs/LLCs accounted for using the equity method and for wholly-owned investment real estate, the carrying value of these investments is written down or impaired to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. For additional information regarding our OTTI policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 General Account Investments of PFI excluding Closed Block Division and Funds Withheld 
 
 In the following sections, we provide details about our investment portfolio, excluding investments held in the Closed Block division and the Funds Withheld portfolios. We believe the details of the composition of our investment portfolio excluding Closed Block division and Funds Withheld are most relevant to an understanding of our operations that are pertinent to investors in Prudential Financial, Inc. because (1) substantially all Closed Block division assets support obligations and liabilities relating to the Closed Block policies where the economics inure to those participating policies and not to shareholders of the Company s common stock and (2) the Funds Withheld assets support liabilities relating to reinsurance agreements where the economic benefits and associated investment risk of the Funds Withheld ultimately inure to the reinsurer. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our material reinsurance agreements and the Closed Block division, respectively. 
 
 In the following sections, prior period amounts have been restated to conform to the current period presentation to exclude investments related to the Funds Withheld portfolios.

 Fixed Maturity Securities Credit Quality 
 
 The Securities Valuation Office SVO of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC evaluates the investments of insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called NAIC Designations. In general, NAIC Designations of 1 highest quality, or 2 high quality, include fixed maturities considered investment grade, which include securities rated Baa3 or higher by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. Moody s or BBB- or higher by Standard Poor s Rating Services S P ). NAIC Designations of 3 through 6 generally include fixed maturities referred to as below investment grade, which include securities rated Ba1 or lower by Moody s and BB+ or lower by S P. The NAIC Designations for commercial mortgage-backed securities and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, including our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, are based on security level expected losses as modeled by an independent third-party (engaged by the NAIC) and the statutory carrying value of the security, including any purchase discounts or impairment charges previously recognized. 
 
 As a result of time lags between the funding of investments, the finalization of legal documents, and the completion of the SVO filing process, the fixed maturity portfolio includes certain securities that have not yet been designated by the SVO as of each balance sheet date. Pending receipt of SVO designations, the categorization of these securities by NAIC Designation is based on the expected ratings indicated by internal analysis. 
 
 Ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies include S P, Moody s, Fitch Ratings Inc. Fitch and Morningstar, Inc. Morningstar ). Low issue composite rating uses ratings from the major credit rating agencies or, if these are not available, an equivalent internal rating. For securities where the ratings assigned are not equivalent, the second lowest rating is utilized. 
 
 Investments of our international insurance companies are not subject to NAIC guidelines. Investments of our Japanese insurance operations are regulated locally by the Financial Services Agency FSA ), an agency of the Japanese government. The FSA has its own investment quality criteria and risk control standards. Our Japanese insurance companies comply with the FSA s credit quality review and risk monitoring guidelines. The credit quality ratings of the investments of our Japanese insurance companies are based on ratings assigned by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, including Moody s and S P, or rating equivalents based on ratings assigned by Japanese credit rating agencies.

 We originate commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans using a dedicated sales and underwriting staff through our various regional offices in the U.S. and international offices primarily in London and Tokyo. All loans are underwritten consistently to our standards using a proprietary quality rating system that has been developed from our industry experience in real estate and mortgage lending. 
 
 Uncollateralized loans primarily represent corporate loans and unsecured consumer loans. 
 
 Residential property loans primarily include Japanese recourse loans. To the extent there is a default on these recourse loans, we can make a claim against the personal assets of the property owner, in addition to the mortgaged property. These loans are also backed by third-party guarantors. 
 
 Other collateralized loans include mezzanine real estate debt investments and consumer loans.

 Loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios are measures commonly used to assess the quality of commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans. The loan-to-value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan and is commonly expressed as a percentage. A loan-to-value ratio less than 100 indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. Loan-to-value ratios greater than 100 indicate that the loan amount exceeds the collateral value. The debt service coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to its debt service payments. Debt service coverage ratios less than 1.0 times indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover the loan s current debt payments. A debt service coverage ratio greater than 1.0 times indicates an excess of net operating income over the debt service payments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans had a weighted-average debt service coverage ratio of 2.42 times and a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 60 . As of September 30, 2024, 96 of commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans were fixed rate loans. For those commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans that were originated in 2024, the weighted-average debt service coverage ratio was 1.62 times, and the weighted-average loan-to-value ratio was 64 . 
 151 

Table of Contents 

The values utilized in calculating these loan-to-value ratios are developed as part of our periodic reviews of the commercial mortgage and agricultural property loan portfolio, which include internal evaluations of the underlying collateral values. Our periodic reviews also include a credit quality re-rating process, whereby we update the internal quality ratings originally assigned at underwriting based on the proprietary quality rating system mentioned above. As discussed below, the internal credit quality rating is a key input in determining our allowance for credit losses. 
 
 For loans with collateral under construction, renovation or lease-up, projected stabilized values and net operating income are used in the calculation of the loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios. Our commercial mortgage and agricultural property loan portfolio included 1.8 billion and 1.5 billion of such loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. All else being equal, these loans are inherently riskier than those collateralized by properties that have already stabilized. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was 0 million and 1 million of allowance related to these loans, respectively. In addition, these unstabilized loans are included in the calculation of our portfolio reserve, as discussed below.

 Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans Quality 
 
 The commercial mortgage and other loans portfolio is monitored on an ongoing basis. If certain criteria are met, loans are assigned to either of the following watch list categories: 
 152 

Table of Contents 

(1) Closely Monitored, which includes a variety of considerations, such as when loan metrics fall below acceptable levels, the borrower is not cooperative or has requested a material modification, or the portfolio manager has directed a change in category; or 
 (2) Not in Good Standing, which includes loans in default or with a high probability of loss of principal, such as when the loan is in the process of foreclosure or the borrower is in bankruptcy. 
 
 Our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list. 
 
 The current expected credit loss CECL allowance represents the Company s best estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining life of the assets. The determination of the allowance considers historical credit loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance is calculated separately for commercial mortgage loans, agricultural mortgage loans, uncollateralized loans, other collateralized loans and residential property loans. 
 
 For commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans, the allowance is calculated using an internally developed CECL model. 
 
 Key inputs to the CECL model include unpaid principal balances, internal credit ratings, annual expected loss factors, average lives of the loans adjusted for prepayment considerations, current and historical interest rate assumptions and other factors influencing the Company s view of the current stage of the economic cycle and future economic conditions. Subjective considerations include a review of whether historical loss experience is representative of current market conditions and the Company s view of the credit cycle. Model assumptions and factors are reviewed and updated as appropriate. 
 
 When individual loans no longer have the credit risk characteristics of the commercial or agricultural mortgage loan pools, they are removed from the pools and are evaluated individually for an allowance. The allowance is determined based on the outstanding loan balance less the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. 
 
 The CECL allowance for other collateralized and uncollateralized loans carried at amortized cost is determined based on probability of default and loss given default assumptions by sector, credit quality and average lives of the loans. 
 
 The following table sets forth the change in allowance for credit losses for our commercial mortgage and other loans portfolio, as of the dates indicated: 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (in millions) Allowance, beginning of year 372 172 Addition to (release of) allowance for credit losses 127 227 Write-downs charged against the allowance 
 (5) (29) Other (1) 2 Allowance, end of period 493 372 
 
 The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 increased in comparison to December 31, 2023 primarily related to increases in the loan-specific reserves within agricultural property loans and commercial mortgage loans within the office sector, along with the establishment of general reserves for both the collateralized and uncollateralized consumer loan portfolios.

 Furthermore, other invested assets include strategic investments made as part of our investment management operations. We make these strategic investments in real estate, as well as fixed income, public equity and real estate securities, including controlling interests. Certain of these investments are made primarily for purposes of co-investment in our managed funds and structured products. Other strategic investments are made with the intention to sell or syndicate to investors, including our general account, or for placement in funds and structured products that we offer and manage (seed investments).

Valuation of Assets and Liabilities 
 
 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 
 
 The authoritative guidance related to fair value measurement establishes a framework that includes a three-level hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. The level in the hierarchy within which the fair value falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement. The fair values of assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 include at least one significant unobservable input in the measurement. See Note 6 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated

 Financial Statements for an additional description of the valuation hierarchy levels as well as for the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by hierarchy level presented on a consolidated basis. 
 
 The table below presents the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as of the periods indicated, and the portion of such assets and liabilities that are classified in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The table also provides details about these assets and liabilities excluding those held in the Closed Block division and Funds Withheld portfolios. We believe the amounts excluding the Closed Block division and Funds Withheld are most relevant to an understanding of our operations that are pertinent to investors in Prudential Financial because (1) substantially all Closed Block division assets support obligations and liabilities relating to the Closed Block policies only and (2) the Funds Withheld portfolios support obligations and liabilities relating to reinsurance agreements where the economic benefits and associated investment risk of the Funds Withheld assets pass to the reinsurers. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our material reinsurance agreements and the Closed Block, respectively.

 (1) Level 3 assets expressed as a percentage of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis for PFI excluding the Closed Block division and Funds Withheld, the Closed Block division and Funds Withheld totaled 2.2 , 3.1 , and 12.0 , respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and 2.1 , 2.8 , and 2.4 , respectively, as of December 31, 2023. 
 (2) All other represents cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
 (3) Other invested assets and Other liabilities primarily include derivatives. The amounts include the impact of netting subject to master netting agreements. 
 
 The determination of fair value, which for certain assets and liabilities is dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, can have a significant impact on our results of operations and may require the application of a greater degree of judgment depending on market conditions, as the ability to value assets and liabilities can be significantly impacted by a decrease in market activity or a lack of transactions executed in an orderly manner. 
 
 Fixed maturity securities included in Level 3 in our fair value hierarchy are generally priced based on internally-developed valuations or indicative broker quotes. For certain private fixed maturity and equity securities, the internal valuation models use significant unobservable inputs and, accordingly, such securities are included in Level 3 in our fair value hierarchy. Level 3 fixed maturity securities for PFI excluding the Closed Block division and Funds Withheld included approximately 1.3 billion of public fixed maturities as of September 30, 2024, with values primarily based on indicative broker quotes, and approximately 7.3 billion of private fixed maturities, with values primarily based on internally-developed models. Significant unobservable inputs used in their valuation included: issue specific spread adjustments, material non-public financial information, management judgment, estimation of future earnings and cash flows, default rate assumptions, liquidity assumptions and indicative quotes from market makers. Separate account assets included in Level 3 in our fair value hierarchy primarily include corporate securities and commercial mortgage loans.

 Contracts or contract features reported in Market risk benefit assets and Market risk benefit liabilities and embedded derivatives reported in Policyholders account balances that are included in Level 3 of our fair value hierarchy represent general account assets and liabilities pertaining to living benefit features of the Company s variable annuity contracts and the index-linked interest credited features on certain life and annuity products. Market risk benefit assets and Market risk benefit liabilities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in Change in value of market risk benefits, net of related hedging gains (losses) except for the portion of the change attributable to changes in the Company s NPR that is recorded in OCI. Embedded derivatives included in Policyholders account balances are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in Realized investment gains (losses), net. These assets and liabilities are valued using internally-developed models that require significant estimates and assumptions developed by management. Changes in these estimates and assumptions can have a significant impact on the results of our operations. For additional information, see Note 6 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the Company. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operations of our businesses, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our businesses, general economic conditions and our access to the capital markets and the alternate sources of liquidity and capital described herein. 
 
 Effective and prudent liquidity and capital management is a priority across the Company. Management monitors the liquidity of Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi-year time horizon. We use a Risk Appetite Framework RAF to ensure that all risks taken across the Company align with our capacity and willingness to take those risks. The RAF provides a dynamic assessment of capital and liquidity stress impacts and is intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available to absorb those impacts. We believe that our capital and liquidity resources are sufficient to satisfy the capital and liquidity requirements of Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by domestic and international regulators. These regulations currently include requirements (many of which are the subject of ongoing rule-making) relating to capital and liquidity management. For information regarding these regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on us, see Business Regulation and Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 From the beginning of 2024 through the date of this report, we took the following significant actions that have impacted, or are expected to impact, our liquidity and capital positions: 
 
 In March, we issued 1 billion of junior subordinated notes. We intend to use these proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the redemption or repurchase of our 1 billion of junior subordinated notes due in 2045. 
 
 In March, we redeemed 500 million of 5.200 junior subordinated notes due in 2044. 
 
 In March, we closed our reinsurance transaction with Somerset Re for a portion of the guaranteed universal life policies issued by Pruco Life Insurance Company and Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey, both of which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Prudential Financial. These reinsured policies represent approximately 30 of the Company s previously established statutory reserves on its in-force guaranteed universal life block of business. As a result of the transaction, our financing of Guideline AXXX reserves in the form of Credit-Linked Notes Structures has been reduced by 5,040 million from December 31, 2023. See Term and Universal Life Reserve Financing below for additional information. 
 
 In July, we amended and restated our 4.0 billion five-year credit facility, extending the term of the facility to July 2029. See Note 15 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 In August, we entered into an agreement with Wilton Re to reinsure certain guaranteed universal life policies issued by Pruco Life and PLNJ, both of which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Prudential Financial. These policies represent 
 158 

Table of Contents 

 approximately 40 of the Company s remaining statutory reserves on its in-force guaranteed universal life block of business, following the March reinsurance agreement with Somerset Re, discussed above. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, is expected to result in proceeds of 350 million. 
 
 In September, we refinanced our 100 billion five-year credit facility, on which PHJ is a borrower, extending the term of the facility to September 2029. See Note 15 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Capital 
 
 The primary components of the Company s capitalization consist of equity and outstanding capital debt, including junior subordinated debt. As shown in the table below, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had 48.8 billion in capital, all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its businesses and its Corporate and Other operations. Based on our assessment of these businesses and operations, we believe this level of capital is consistent with our ratings targets.

 __________ 
 (1) Amounts attributable to Prudential Financial, excluding AOCI. 
 
 We manage PICA, The Prudential Life Insurance Company, Ltd. Prudential of Japan ), Gibraltar Life, and other significant insurance subsidiaries to regulatory capital levels consistent with our AA ratings targets. We utilize the risk-based capital RBC ratio as a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our domestic insurance subsidiaries and the solvency margin ratio as a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our Japanese insurance subsidiaries. 
 
 RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring an insurer s solvency and ability to pay future claims. The reporting of RBC measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities, but is available to the public. 
 
 PICA s RBC ratio as of December 31, 2023, its most recent statutory fiscal year-end and RBC reporting date, was 435 . PICA s RBC ratio is calculated on a consolidated basis and included Pruco Life Insurance Company Pruco Life ), Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey PLNJ ), which is a subsidiary of Pruco Life, and Prudential Legacy Insurance Company of New Jersey PLIC ). 
 
 Similar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which we operate generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies based on local statutory accounting practices. These solvency margins are a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our international insurance operations. Maintenance of our solvency margins at certain levels is also important to our competitive positioning, as in certain jurisdictions, such as Japan, these solvency margins are required to be disclosed to the public and therefore impact the public perception of an insurer s financial strength. 
 
 The table below presents the solvency margin ratios of our most significant international insurance subsidiaries as of June 30, 2024, the most recent date for which this information is available.

Table of Contents 

 All of our domestic and significant international insurance subsidiaries have capital levels that substantially exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations. The statutory capital of our insurance companies and our overall capital flexibility could be impacted by, among other things, market conditions and changes in insurance reserves, including those stemming from updates to our actuarial assumptions. Our regulatory capital levels also may be affected in the future by changes to the applicable regulations, proposals for which are currently under consideration by both domestic and international insurance regulators. For additional information regarding the calculation of RBC and solvency margin ratios, as well as regulatory minimums, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Shareholder Distributions 
 
 Share Repurchase Program and Shareholder Dividends 
 
 In December 2023, Prudential Financial s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase, at management s discretion, up to 1.0 billion of its outstanding Common Stock during the period from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. In general, the timing and amount of share repurchases are determined by management based on market conditions and other considerations, including compliance with applicable laws and any increased capital needs of our businesses due to, among other things, credit migration and losses in our investment portfolio, changes in regulatory capital requirements and opportunities for growth and acquisitions. Repurchases may be executed in the open market, through derivative, accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 
 The following table sets forth information about declarations of Common Stock dividends, as well as repurchases of shares of Prudential Financial s Common Stock, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity management and stress testing are performed on a legal entity basis as the ability to transfer funds between subsidiaries is limited due in part to regulatory restrictions. Liquidity needs are determined through daily and quarterly cash flow forecasting at the holding company and within our operating subsidiaries. We seek to maintain a minimum balance of highly liquid assets to ensure that adequate liquidity is available at Prudential Financial to cover fixed expenses in the event that we experience reduced cash flows from our operating subsidiaries at a time when access to capital markets is also not available. 
 
 We seek to mitigate the risk of having limited or no access to financing due to stressed market conditions by generally pre-funding debt in advance of maturity. We mitigate the refinancing risk associated with our debt that is used to fund operating needs by matching the term of debt with the assets financed. To ensure adequate liquidity in stress scenarios, stress testing is performed for our major operating subsidiaries. We seek to further mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining our access to alternative sources of liquidity, as discussed below.

 Liquidity of Prudential Financial 
 
 The principal sources of funds available to Prudential Financial, the parent holding company, are dividends, returns of capital and loans from subsidiaries, and proceeds from debt issuances and certain stock-based compensation activity. These sources of funds may be supplemented by Prudential Financial s access to the capital markets as well as the Alternative Sources of Liquidity described below. 
 
 The primary uses of funds at Prudential Financial include servicing debt, making capital contributions and loans to subsidiaries, making acquisitions, paying declared shareholder dividends and repurchasing outstanding shares of Common Stock executed under authority from the Board. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Prudential Financial had highly liquid assets with a carrying value totaling 5,095 million, an increase of 524 million from December 31, 2023. Highly liquid assets predominantly include cash, short-term investments, U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of other U.S. government authorities and agencies, and/or foreign government bonds. We maintain an intercompany liquidity account that is designed to optimize the use of cash by facilitating the lending and borrowing of funds between Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries on a daily basis. Excluding the net borrowings from this intercompany liquidity account, Prudential Financial had highly liquid assets of 4,348 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 253 million from December 31, 2023.

Dividends and Returns of Capital from Subsidiaries 
 
 Domestic insurance subsidiaries. During the first nine months of 2024, Prudential Financial received dividends of 650 million from PICA. In addition to paying Common Stock dividends, our domestic insurance operations may return capital to Prudential Financial by other means, such as affiliated lending, and reinsurance with Bermuda-based affiliates. In the second quarter of 2024, a domestic captive insurance subsidiary entered into an affiliated loan with a holding company to facilitate a return of capital of 800 million, which included proceeds from the reinsurance of a portion of the Company s guaranteed universal life policies. 
 
 International insurance subsidiaries . During the first nine months of 2024, Prudential Financial received dividends of 568 million from its international insurance subsidiaries. In addition to paying Common Stock dividends, our international insurance operations may return capital to Prudential Financial by other means, such as the repayment of preferred stock obligations held by Prudential Financial or other affiliates, affiliated lending, affiliated derivatives and reinsurance with U.S.- and Bermuda-based affiliates. 
 
 Other subsidiaries. During the first nine months of 2024, Prudential Financial received dividends of 46 million from PGIM subsidiaries and 8 million from other subsidiaries. 
 
 Restriction on dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries. Our insurance companies are subject to limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to Prudential Financial and other affiliates under applicable insurance law and regulation. Further, market conditions could negatively impact capital positions of our insurance companies, which could further restrict their ability to pay dividends. More generally, the payment of dividends by any of our subsidiaries is subject to declaration by their Board of Directors and can be affected by market conditions and other factors. 
 
 With respect to our domestic insurance subsidiaries, PICA is permitted to pay ordinary dividends based on calculations specified under New Jersey insurance law, subject to prior notification to the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance NJDOBI ). Any distributions above this amount in any twelve-month period are considered to be extraordinary dividends, and the approval of the NJDOBI is required prior to payment. The laws regulating dividends of the states where our other domestic insurance companies are domiciled are similar, but not identical, to those of New Jersey. 
 
 Capital redeployment from our international insurance subsidiaries is subject to local regulatory requirements in the international jurisdictions in which they operate. Our most significant international insurance subsidiaries, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life, are permitted to pay Common Stock dividends based on calculations specified by Japanese insurance business law. Dividends in excess of these amounts and other forms of capital distribution may require the prior approval of the FSA. The regulatory fiscal year end for both Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life is March 31, after which time the Common Stock dividend amount permitted to be paid without prior approval from the FSA can be determined. 
 
 The ability of our PGIM subsidiaries and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries to pay dividends is largely unrestricted from a regulatory standpoint. 
 
 See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for information regarding specific dividend restrictions. 

Liquidity of Insurance Subsidiaries 
 
 We manage the liquidity of our insurance operations to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. Liquidity within each of our insurance subsidiaries is provided by a variety of sources, including portfolios of liquid assets. The investment portfolios of our subsidiaries are integral to the overall liquidity of our insurance operations. We segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset/liability management approach specific to the requirements of each of our product lines. This enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity, as well as the interest rate and credit risk profiles, of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities. 
 162 

Table of Contents 

Liquidity is measured against internally-developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (for example, type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate our insurance operations liquidity under various stress scenarios, including company-specific and market-wide events. We continue to believe that cash generated by ongoing operations and the profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios for each of our insurance subsidiaries. 
 
 The principal sources of liquidity for our insurance subsidiaries are premiums, investment and fee income, investment maturities, sales of investments, and sales associated with our insurance and annuity operations, as well as internal and external borrowings. The principal uses of liquidity include benefits, claims and dividends paid to policyholders, and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. Other uses of liquidity may include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, the payment of dividends to the parent holding company, hedging and reinsurance activity and payments in connection with financing activities.

 Liquidity associated with other activities 
 
 Hedging activities associated with Individual Retirement Strategies 
 
 For the portion of our Individual Retirement Strategies ALM strategy executed through hedging, we enter into a range of exchange-traded, cleared and other OTC equity and interest rate derivatives in order to hedge certain capital market risks related to more severe market conditions. For a full discussion of our Individual Retirement Strategies risk management strategy, see Results of Operations by Segment U.S. Businesses Retirement Strategies . This portion of our Individual Retirement Strategies ALM strategy requires access to liquidity to meet payment obligations relating to these derivatives, such as payments for periodic settlements, purchases, maturities and terminations. These liquidity needs can vary materially due to, among other items, changes in interest rates, equity markets, mortality and policyholder behavior. 
 
 The hedging portion of our Individual Retirement Strategies ALM strategy may also result in derivative related collateral postings to (when we are in a net post position) or from (when we are in a net receive position) counterparties. The net collateral position depends on changes in interest rates and equity markets related to the amount of the exposures hedged. Depending on market conditions, the collateral posting requirements can result in material liquidity needs when we are in a net post position. 

Foreign exchange hedging activities 
 
 We employ various hedging strategies to manage potential exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements, particularly those associated with the yen. Our overall yen hedging strategy calibrates the hedge level to preserve the relative contribution of our yen-based business to the Company s overall return on equity on a leverage neutral basis. 
 
 We hold both internal and external hedges primarily to hedge our USD-equivalent equity. These hedges also mitigate volatility in the solvency margins of yen-based subsidiaries resulting from changes in the market value of their USD-denominated investments hedging our USD-equivalent equity attributable to changes in the yen-USD exchange rate. 
 
 For additional information regarding our hedging strategy, see Results of Operations Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates. 
 
 Cash settlements from these hedging activities result in cash flows between subsidiaries of Prudential Financial and either international-based subsidiaries or external parties. The cash flows are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged. For example, a significant yen depreciation over an extended period of time could result in net cash inflows, while a significant yen appreciation could result in net cash outflows. The following tables set forth information about net cash settlements and the net asset or liability resulting from these hedging activities related to the yen and other currencies for the periods indicated:

 (4) As of September 30, 2024, approximately 164 million, 519 million, 183 million and 239 million of the net market values are scheduled to settle in 2024, 2025, 2026, and thereafter, respectively. The net market value of the assets (liabilities) will vary with changing market conditions to the extent there are no corresponding offsetting positions. 
 
 PGIM operations 
 
 The principal sources of liquidity for our fee-based PGIM businesses include cash flows from asset management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing activities, and internal and external funding facilities. The principal uses of liquidity for our fee-based PGIM businesses include general and administrative expenses, facilitating our commercial mortgage loan business, funding needs of our seed and co-investment portfolio and distributions of dividends and returns of capital to Prudential Financial. The primary liquidity risks for our fee-based PGIM businesses relate to their profitability, which is impacted by market conditions, our investment management performance and client redemptions. We believe the cash flows from our fee-based PGIM businesses are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations, as well as requirements that could arise under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios, which are monitored through the use of internal measures. 
 
 The principal sources of liquidity for our seed and co-investments held in our PGIM businesses are cash flows from investments, cash flows from our fee-based businesses, as described above, borrowing lines from internal sources, including Prudential Financial and Prudential Funding, LLC Prudential Funding ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of PICA, and external sources, including PGIM s limited-recourse credit facility. The principal uses of liquidity for our seed and co-investments include making investments to support business growth and paying interest expense from the internal and external borrowings used to fund those investments. The primary liquidity risks include the inability to sell assets in a timely manner, declines in the value of assets and credit defaults. 
 
 There have been no material changes to the liquidity position of our PGIM operations since December 31, 2023. 

Alternative Sources of Liquidity 
 
 In addition to asset-based financing as discussed below, Prudential Financial and certain subsidiaries have access to other sources of liquidity, including syndicated, unsecured committed credit facilities, membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, a funding agreement facility with Farmer Mac, commercial paper programs and contingent financing facilities in the form of facility agreements. For additional information regarding these sources of liquidity, see Note 15 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Asset-based Financing 
 
 We conduct asset-based or secured financing within our insurance and other subsidiaries, including transactions such as securities lending, committed and uncommitted repurchase agreements and mortgage dollar rolls, to earn spread income, to borrow funds, or to facilitate trading activity. These programs are primarily driven by portfolio holdings of securities that are lendable based on counterparty demand for these securities in the marketplace. The collateral received in connection with these programs is primarily used to purchase securities in the short-term spread portfolios of our insurance entities. Investments held in the short-term spread portfolios include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments (primarily corporate bonds), mortgage loans and fixed maturities (primarily collateralized loan obligations and other structured securities), with a weighted average life at time of purchase by the short-term portfolios of four years or less. Floating rate assets comprise the majority of our short-term spread portfolio. These short-term portfolios are subject to specific investment policy statements, which among other things, do not allow for significant asset/liability interest rate duration mismatch.

 (1) The daily average outstanding balance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 11,139 million and 10,565 million, respectively, for PFI excluding the Closed Block division, and 3,718 million and 3,719 million, respectively, for the Closed Block division. 
 (2) Includes utilization of external funding facilities for PGIM s commercial mortgage origination business.

 As of September 30, 2024, our domestic insurance entities had assets eligible for the asset-based or secured financing programs of 105.5 billion, of which 16.0 billion were on loan. Taking into account market conditions and outstanding loan balances as of September 30, 2024, we believe approximately 16.8 billion of the remaining eligible assets are readily lendable, including approximately 14.1 billion relating to PFI excluding the Closed Block division, of which 6.7 billion relates to certain separate accounts and may only be used for financing activities related to those accounts, and the remaining 2.7 billion relating to the Closed Block division. 

Financing Activities 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, total short-term and long-term debt of the Company on a consolidated basis was 20 billion, an increase of 0.5 billion from December 31, 2023. The following table sets forth total consolidated borrowings of the Company as of the dates indicated. We may, from time to time, seek to redeem or repurchase our outstanding debt securities through open market purchases, individually negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such actions will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity position, and other factors.

 (2) Limited and non-recourse borrowing primarily represents mortgage debt of our subsidiaries that has recourse only to real estate investment property of 151 million and 157 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and a draw on a credit facility that has recourse only to collateral pledged by the Company of 255 million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants related to the borrowings in the table above. For additional information regarding the Company s short- and long-term debt obligations, see Note 15 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Prudential Financial s consolidated borrowings increased 0.5 billion from December 31, 2023. In March 2024, the Company issued 1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 6.50 junior subordinated notes due in March 2054. In March 2024, the Company redeemed, in full, 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.20 junior subordinated notes due in 2044. 
 
 Term and Universal Life Reserve Financing 
 
 We use captive reinsurance subsidiaries to finance the portion of the statutory reserves required to be held by our domestic life insurance companies under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX that we consider to be non-economic. The financing arrangements involve the reinsurance of term and universal life business to our captive reinsurers and the issuance of surplus notes by those captives that are treated as capital for statutory purposes. These surplus notes are subordinated to policyholder obligations, and the payment of principal and interest on the surplus notes can only be made with prior insurance regulatory approval. 
 
 We have entered into agreements with external counterparties providing for the issuance of surplus notes by our captive reinsurers in return for the receipt of credit-linked notes Credit-Linked Note Structures ). As of September 30, 2024, we had Credit-Linked Note Structures with an aggregate issuance capacity of 11,250 million, of which 8,780 million was outstanding, compared to December 31, 2023, where we had an aggregate issuance capacity of 15,700 million, of which 13,820 million was outstanding. Under the agreements, the captive receives in exchange for the surplus notes one or more credit-linked notes issued by a special-purpose affiliate of the Company with an aggregate principal amount equal to the surplus notes outstanding. The captive holds the credit-linked notes as assets supporting Regulation XXX or Guideline AXXX non-economic reserves, as applicable. For additional information regarding our Credit-Linked Note Structures, see Management s

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market risk is the risk of fluctuations in the value of financial instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices or commodity prices. To varying degrees, our products and services, and the investment activities supporting them, generate exposure to market risk. The market risk incurred, and our strategies for managing this risk, vary by product. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in our economic exposure to market risk from December 31, 2023, a description of which may be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2023, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See Item 1A. Risk Factors included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a discussion of how difficult conditions in the financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of our operations. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 In order to ensure that the information we must disclose in our filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis, the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. No change in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
