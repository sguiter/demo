days delinquent or if full collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain. Accrued interest for a security placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. There was no accrued interest related to securities reversed against interest income for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, respectively. The Company records its available-for-sale securities portfolio at fair value. Fair values of these securities are determined based on methodologies in accordance with current authoritative accounting guidance. Fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors, including market interest rates, prepayment speeds, discount rates, credit ratings, and yield curves. Fair values for securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or an estimate of fair value by using a range of fair value estimates in the marketplace as a result of the illiquid market, specific to the type of security. The Company s investment portfolio currently consists of obligations of state and political subdivisions, mortgage pass-through securities, corporate bonds and general obligation or revenue based municipal bonds. Pricing for such securities is generally readily available and transparent in the market. The Company utilizes independent third-party pricing services to value its investment securities, which the Company reviews as well as the underlying pricing methodologies for reasonableness and to ensure such prices are aligned with pricing matrices. The Company validates prices supplied by the independent pricing services by comparison to prices obtained from other third-party sources on a quarterly basis.

The Company did t hold any securities classified as held-to-maturity at September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023, or December 31, 2023. The Company invests in mortgage-backed securities that have expected maturities that differ from their contractual maturities. These differences arise because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without a prepayment penalty. These securities include collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and other asset backed securities. The expected maturities of these securities at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023, were computed by using scheduled amortization of balances and historical prepayment rates.

The number of investments in an unrealized loss position totaled at September 30, 2024. We believe any unrealized losses in the U.S. treasury securities, obligations of state and political subdivisions, residential and commercial mortgage-backed and asset-backed investment securities, and corporate bonds and other at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023, are due to changes in interest rates and not credit-related events. As such, no allowance for credit losses is required on these securities at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023. Unrealized losses on investment securities are expected to recover over time as these securities approach maturity. Based on evaluations of impaired securities as of September 30, 2024, the Company does not intend to sell any impaired available-for-sale securities before fair value recovers to the current amortized cost, and it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be required to sell impaired securities before fair value recovers, which may be maturity. Our mortgage related securities are backed by GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC or are collateralized by securities backed by these agencies. At September 30, 2024, of our available-for-sale securities that are obligations of states and political subdivisions were issued within the State of Texas, of which are guaranteed by the Texas Permanent School Fund. Securities, carried at approximately on September 30, 2024, were pledged as collateral for public or trust fund deposits, repurchase agreements, borrowings and for other purposes required or permitted by law. During the three-months ended September 30, 2024 , there were sales of investment securities that were classified as available-for-sale. During the three-months ended September 30, 2023, sales of investment securities that were classified as available-for-sale were .

Modifications of receivables to debtors experiencing financial difficulty On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the accounting guidance in ASU 2022-02, which eliminates the recognition and measurement of a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR). Due to the removal of the TDR designation, the Company evaluates all loan restructurings according to the accounting guidance for loan modifications to determine if the restructuring results in a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that result in a direct change in the timing or amount of contractual cash flows include situations where there is principal forgiveness, term extensions, interest rate reduction, and combinations of the listed modifications. Therefore, the disclosures related to loan restructurings are only for modifications that directly affect cash flows. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses due to the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty was insignificant. 

, and at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023, , and , respectively, are valued at the lower of cost or fair value, and the remaining amounts are valued under the fair value option. These loans, which are sold on a servicing released basis, are valued using a market approach by utilizing either: (i) the fair value of the securities backed by similar mortgage loans, adjusted for certain factors to approximate the fair value of a whole mortgage loan, including the value attributable to mortgage servicing and credit risk, (ii) current commitments to purchase loans or (iii) recent observable market trades for similar loans, adjusted for credit risk and other individual loan characteristics. As these prices are derived from market observable inputs, the Company classifies these valuations as Level 2 in the fair value disclosures (see Note 9). Interest income on mortgage loans held-for-sale is recognized based on the contractual rates and reflected in interest income on loans in the consolidated statements of earnings. The Company has no continuing ownership in any residential mortgage loans sold. The Company originates certain mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market. The mortgage loan sales contracts contain indemnification clauses should the loans default, generally in the first three to six months, or if documentation is determined not to be in compliance with regulations. The Company s historic losses as a result of these indemnities have been insignificant.

Securities sold under repurchase agreements are generally with significant customers of the Company that require short-term liquidity for their funds for which the Company pledges certain securities that have a fair value equal to at least the amount of the borrowings. The agreements mature daily and therefore the risk arising from a decline in the fair value of the collateral pledged is minimal. The securities pledged are mortgage-backed securities. These agreements do not include right of set-off provisions and therefore the Company does not offset such agreements for financial reporting purposes. The Company renewed its loan agreement, effective , with Frost Bank. Under the loan agreement, as renewed and amended, we are permitted to draw up to on a revolving line of credit. There was outstanding balance under the line of credit as of September 30, 2024. During 2021, the Company began investing in qualifying Community Development Entities ("CDE") under the federal New Market Tax Credits ("NMTC") program. See Note 7 for further discussion of our activity and related balances on the consolidated balance sheets, including the in other borrowings shown above. 

 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to for the same period in 2023. The Company s effective tax rates on pretax income were and for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income tax expense was for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to for the same period in 2023. The Company s effective tax rates on pretax income were and for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal tax rate of primarily due to tax exempt interest income earned on certain investment securities and loans, the deductibility of dividends paid to our employee stock ownership plan, excess tax benefits for distributions under our deferred compensation plan and vesting of equity awards, and NMTC benefits. Low Income Housing Tax Credit Investments - During 2021, the Company began investing in an affordable housing fund that will invest in real estate projects that qualify for the federal low-income housing tax credit ("LIHTC") program designed to promote private development of low income housing. The investments made by the fund will generate a return to the Company primarily through the realization of LIHTCs, and also through federal tax deductions generated from the ongoing operating losses from the investees of the fund. The Company's investment in the fund will be amortized through income tax expense using the proportional amortization method as related tax credits are utilized by the Company. The initial capital contribution commitment to the fund was for up to . Contributions were at September 30, 2024, and at September 30, 2023, and at December 31, 2023, respectively, which is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. New Market Tax Credit Investments - During 2021, the Company began investing in qualifying CDEs under the federal NMTC program. NMTC investments are made through the third-party CDEs which are qualified through the U.S. Department of Treasury and receive periodic allocation of amounts under the NMTC program. NMTCs are generated from qualified investments by the CDEs utilizing equity investments made by a taxpayer, like the Company. Through these equity investments, the Company will receive the tax benefits from the NMTCs equal to of the qualified investment from the CDE to qualifying eligible projects over a seven year period. The Company's equity investments in the CDEs is amortized using the proportional amortization method and related tax credits are allocated to the Company. At September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2023, the consolidated balance sheet of the Company included a loan to the investee in loans and the leveraged loan from the investee in other borrowings (see Note 6). At September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023, the consolidated balance sheet of the Company included CDE investments in other assets of , , and , respectively.

Performance Stock Units Also under the 2021 Plan, the Company awards performance-based restricted stock units PSUs to employees, senior and executive officers, and directors.

The number of shares issued upon vesting will range from to of the PSUs granted. The PSUs vest at the end of a period based on either each on average adjusted earnings per share growth and return on average assets, or return on average assets, as reported, adjusted for unusual gains/losses, merger expenses, and other items as approved by the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors. Performance for each period is measured relative to other U.S. publicly traded banks with billion to billion in assets. Compensation expense for the PSUs will be estimated each period based on the fair value of the stock at the grant date and the most probable outcome of the performance condition, adjusted for the passage of time within the vesting period of the awards.

Total gain on sale of mortgage loans 

residential mortgage loans held-for-sale were 90 days or more past due or considered nonaccrual as of September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023, or December 31, 2023 . significant credit losses were recognized on mortgage loans held-for-sale for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Certain non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include other real estate owned, goodwill and other intangible assets, and other non-financial long-lived assets. Non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 include other real estate owned which, subsequent to their initial transfer to other real estate owned from loans, were re-measured at fair value through a write-down included in gain (loss) on sale of foreclosed assets. During the reported periods, all fair value measurements for foreclosed assets utilized Level 2 inputs based on observable market data, generally third-party appraisals, or Level 3 inputs based on customized discounting criteria. These appraisals are evaluated individually and discounted as necessary due to the age of the appraisal, lack of comparable sales, expected holding periods of property or specia l use type of the property. Such discounts vary by appraisal based on the above factors but generally range from to of the appraised value. Re-evaluation of other real estate owned is performed at least annually as required by regulatory guidelines or more often if particular circumstances arise. There were significant other real estate owned properties that were re-measured subsequent to their initial transfer to other real estate owned during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023, other real estate owned totaled , , and , respectively. The Company is required under current authoritative accounting guidance to disclose the estimated fair value of their financial instrument assets and liabilities including those subject to the requirements discussed above. For the Company, as for most financial institutions, substantially all of its assets and liabilities are considered financial instruments. Many of the Company s financial instruments, however, lack an available trading market as characterized by a willing buyer and willing seller engaging in an exchange transaction. The estimated fair value amounts of financial instruments have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. In addition, reasonable comparability between financial institutions may not be likely due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates that must be made given the absence of active secondary markets for many of the financial instruments. This lack of uniform valuation methodologies also introduces a greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values. Cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits in banks and accrued interest receivable and payable are liquid in nature and considered Levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial instruments with stated maturities have been valued using a present value discounted cash flow with a discount rate approximating current market for similar assets and liabilities and are considered Levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial instrument liabilities with no stated maturities have an estimated fair value equal to both the amount payable on demand and the carrying value and are considered Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of the Company s contractual off-balance-sheet unfunded lines of credit, loan commitments and letters of credit, which are generally priced at market at the time of funding, are not material.

 Introduction 
 
 As a financial holding company, we generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments, trust fees, gain on sale of mortgage loans and service charges and fees on deposit accounts. Our primary source of funding for our loans and investments are deposits held by our bank subsidiary, First Financial Bank. Our largest expenses are interest on deposits and salaries and related employee benefits. We measure our performance by calculating our return on average assets, return on average equity, regulatory capital ratios, net interest margin and efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and noninterest income. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying footnotes included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q as well as those included in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 We prepare consolidated financial statements based on generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and customary practices in the banking industry. These policies, in certain areas, require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. 
 We deem a policy critical if (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimate; and (ii) different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the financial statements. 
 We deem our most critical accounting policies to be (i) our allowance for credit losses and our provision for credit losses and (ii) our valuation of financial instruments. We have other significant accounting policies and continue to evaluate the materiality of their impact on our consolidated financial statements, but we believe these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are difficult or subjective, or it is less likely they would have a material impact on our reported results for a given period. A discussion of (i) our allowance for credit losses and our provision for credit losses and (ii) our valuation of financial instruments is included in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 10. 
 Stock Repurchase 
 On July 23, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors re-authorized the repurchase of up to 5 million common shares through July 31, 2025. The prior authorization had been in place since July 27, 2021. The stock repurchase plan authorizes management to repurchase and retire the stock at such time as repurchases and retirements are considered beneficial to the Company and stockholders. Any repurchase of stock will be made through the open market, block trades, or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Under the repurchase plan, there is no minimum number of shares that the Company is required to repurchase. Under the authorization effective through July 31, 2024, the Company repurchased and retired 101,337 shares (all during September 2023) at an average price of 26.99 per share.

Recent Developments 
 Effective April 22, 2024, First Financial Bank and First Financial Trust and Asset Management Company converted their charters to a Texas state banking association and a Texas chartered trust company, respectively. The Bank is now a Texas banking association chartered and regulated by the Texas Department of Banking and Trust Company is now a Texas trust company chartered and regulated by the Texas Department of Banking. The Bank will continue to be a member bank of the Federal Reserve system and maintain FDIC deposit insurance. 
 Results of Operations 
 Performance Summary . Net earnings for the third quarter of 2024 were 55.31 million, an increase of 11.61 when compared to earnings of 49.56 million for the third quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share was 0.39 for the third quarter of 2024 and 0.35 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 The return on average assets was 1.66 for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 1.53 for the third quarter of 2023. The return on average equity was 14.00 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 14.51 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Net earnings for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 were 161.19 million, an increase of 5.36 when compared to earnings of 153.00 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023. Diluted earnings per share was 1.13 for the first nine months of 2024 and 1.07 for the first nine months of 2023. 
 The return on average assets was 1.63 for the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 1.59 for the first nine months of 2023. The return on average equity was 14.28 for the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 15.22 for the same period in 2023. 
 Net Interest Income . Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on liabilities incurred to fund those assets. Our earning assets consist primarily of loans and investment securities. Our liabilities to fund those assets consist primarily of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits. 
 Tax-equivalent net interest income was 109.74 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 96.97 million for the same period last year. The increase in 2024 tax equivalent net interest income compared to 2023 was largely attributable to the change in the mix of interest earning assets primarily derived from an increase in average loans offset by a decrease in taxable and tax-exempt investment securities. Additionally, the rates received on loans continued to increase along with the rates paid on deposits. Average earning assets were 12.48 billion for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 11.96 billion during the third quarter of 2023. The increase of 516.97 million in average earning assets for the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily a result of (i) an increase in loans of 749.17 million, offset by (ii) a decrease in tax-exempt securities of 160.45 million, and (iii) a decrease in taxable investment securities of 217.80 million. Average interest-bearing liabilities were 8.37 billion for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 7.88 billion in the same period in 2023. The yield on earning assets increased 60 basis points while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 44 basis points for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Tax-equivalent net interest income was 318.40 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 295.20 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in 2024 tax equivalent net interest income compared to 2023 was largely attributable to the change in the mix of interest earning assets primarily derived from an increase in average loans offset by a decrease in taxable and tax-exempt investment securities. Additionally, the rates received on loans continued to increase along with the rates paid on deposits. Average earning assets were 12.36 billion for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 12.03 billion during the same period last year. The increase of 331.18 million in average earning assets for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily a result of (i) an increase in loans of 724.81 million, offset by (ii) a decrease in tax-exempt securities of 241.10 million, and (iii) a decrease in taxable investment securities of 283.50 million. Average interest-bearing liabilities were 8.32 billion for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7.78 billion in the same period in 2023. The yield on earning assets increased 70 basis points while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 74 basis points for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine-months ended September 30, 2023.

(1) Computed on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a marginal tax rate of 21 . 

(2) Nonaccrual loans are included in loans. 

The net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, was 3.50 for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 28 basis points from the same period in 2023. The net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, for the first nine-months of 2024 was 3.44 , an increase of 16 basis points from the same period in 2023. The net interest margin has expanded during the past year primarily due to (i) a shift in asset mix from investment securities to higher yielding loans, and (ii) increased loan yields due to new and renewing loans and variable rate loans repricing higher. The Federal Reserve began aggressively increasing interest rates in March 2022 and continuing into 2023 with increases of 25 basis points in February, March, May, and July 2023. Most recently, the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates 50 basis points in September 2024, resulting in a target rate range of 4.75 to 5.00 at September 30, 2024. 
 There are 938.59 million of municipal and related deposits which are indexed to short-term treasury rates which have continued to increase with the changes in the applicable rate index. Average municipal and related deposits totaled 1.48 billion for both of the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with an average rate paid of 4.03 and 2.95 , for the respective nine-months then ended.

Trust fee income increased 1.64 million, or 16.36 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. Trust revenue has increased primarily due to the growth in assets under management to 10.86 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 9.02 billion at September 30, 2023, and additionally from increases in oil and gas related fees. Available-for-sale securities totaling 113.13 million with an average book yield of 3.53 were sold in the third quarter of 2023 resulting in a loss on sales of securities of 972 thousand.

Noninterest Expense . Total noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 66.01 million, compared to 59.54 million for the same period of 2023. An important measure in determining whether a financial institution effectively manages noninterest expense is the efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis and noninterest income. Lower ratios indicate better efficiency since more income is generated with a lower noninterest expense total. Our efficiency ratio was 46.45 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 47.62 for the same quarter in 2023. 
 
 Salaries, commissions and employee benefits for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 37.50 million, compared to 32.94 million for the same period in 2023. The increase from prior year is related primarily to increases of 2.06 million in profit sharing expense and 288 thousand in bonus and incentive accruals related to annualized earnings growth. Additionally, officer and employee salaries increased for additions to the middle market lending team and the audit and risk departments as well as merit-based pay increases since the prior year. 
 
 All other categories of noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 28.52 million, compared to 26.60 million in the same quarter a year ago. Noninterest expense, excluding salary related costs, for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 increased largely due to increases in software amortization and expense, legal expenses and professional and service fees when compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Total noninterest expense for the first nine months of 2024 was 194.97 million, compared to 174.41 million for the same period of 2023. Our efficiency ratio was 47.39 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 45.75 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Salaries, commissions and employee benefits for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 111.65 million, compared to 96.16 million for the same period in 2023. The net increase was primarily a result of merit-based and market driven pay increases, additions to the middle market lending team and the audit and risk departments, performance based incentive accruals, an increase of 5.64 million in profit sharing expense and an increase of 2.20 million in medical insurance expense. 
 
 All other categories of noninterest expense for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 83.31 million, compared to 78.25 million in the same period a year ago. Noninterest expense, excluding salary related costs, for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 increased largely due to increases in software amortization and expense, legal expenses, and professional and service fees.

Of the 4.52 billion of variable interest rate loans shown above, loans totaling 1.92 billion mature or reprice over the next twelve months. Of this amount, approximately 1.51 billion will reprice immediately upon changes in the underlying index rate (primarily U.S. prime rate) with the remaining 410.16 million being subject to floors above or ceilings below the current index. 
 Asset Quality . Our loan portfolio is subject to periodic reviews by our centralized independent loan review group as well as periodic examinations by bank regulatory agencies. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the collectability of principal or interest under the original terms becomes doubtful. Nonaccrual, past due 90 days or more and still accruing, and foreclosed assets were 64.42 million at September 30, 2024, as compared to 39.70 million at September 30, 2023 and 35.10 million at December 31, 2023. As a percent of loans held-for-investment and foreclosed assets, these assets were 0.83 at September 30, 2024, 0.57 at September 30, 2023, and 0.49 at December 31, 2023. As a percent of total assets, these assets were 0.47 at September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.31 at September 30, 2023 and 0.27 at December 31, 2023, respectively. We believe the level of these assets to be manageable and are not aware of any material classified credits not properly disclosed as nonperforming at September 30, 2024.

We record interest payments received on nonaccrual loans as reductions of principal. Prior to the loans being placed on nonaccrual, we recognized interest income on these loans of approximately 913 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2023. If interest on these loans had been recognized on a full accrual basis during the year ended December 31, 2023, such income would have been approximately 3.22 million. Such amounts for the 2024 and 2023 interim periods were not significant. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses . The allowance for credit losses is the amount we determine as of a specific date to be appropriate to absorb current expected credit losses on existing loans. For a discussion of our methodology, see our accounting policies in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). 
 The provision for loan losses of 5.55 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 is combined with the provision for unfunded commitments of 571 thousand and reported in the net aggregate of 6.12 million under the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings for the three-months ended September 30, 2024. The provision for loan losses of 12.72 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 is combined with the provision for unfunded commitments of 101 thousand and reported in the net aggregate of 12.82 million under the provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of earnings for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024. 
 54 

The provision for loan losses of 3.82 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2023 is combined with the reversal of provision for unfunded commitments of 1.55 million and reported in the aggregate of 2.28 million under the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings for the three-months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for loan losses of 15.05 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023 is combined with the reversal of provision for unfunded commitments of 4.42 million and reported in the net aggregate of 10.63 million under the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023. 
 As a percent of average loans, net loan charge-offs were 0.04 for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to net loan charge-offs of 0.04 for the third quarter of 2023. As a percent of average loans, net loan charge-offs were 0.03 for the first nine months of 2024, as compared to net loan charge-offs of 0.02 for the first nine months of 2023. The allowance for credit losses as a percent of loans held-for-investment was 1.29 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.28 as of September 30, 2023 and 1.24 as of December 31, 2023, respectively.

Interest-Bearing Demand Deposits in Banks. The Company had interest-bearing deposits in banks of 287.48 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 180.01 million at September 30, 2023 and 255.24 million at December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, interest-bearing deposits in banks included 273.63 million maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and 13.85 million on deposit with the FHLB. 
 Available-for-Sale Securities . At September 30, 2024, securities with a fair value of 4.61 billion were classified as securities available-for-sale. As compared to December 31, 2023, the available-for-sale portfolio at September 30, 2024 reflected (i) a decrease of 189.22 million in U.S. Treasury securities, (ii) a decrease of 25.67 million in obligations of states and political subdivisions, (iii) an increase of 92.35 million in mortgage-backed securities, and (iv) an increase of 2.08 million in corporate bonds and other securities. Fluctuations in the available-for-sale securities portfolio balances were primarily driven by calls and maturities, and changes in unrealized losses during the first nine months of 2024. Our mortgage related securities are backed by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC, or are collateralized by securities backed by these agencies. 
 See the below table and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for additional disclosures relating to the maturities and fair values of the investment portfolio at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023.

All yields are computed on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a marginal tax rate of 21 . Yields on available-for-sale securities are based on amortized cost. Maturities of mortgage-backed securities are based on contractual maturities and could differ due to prepayments of underlying mortgages. Maturities of other securities are reported at the earlier of maturity date or call date. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the investment portfolio had an overall tax equivalent yield of 2.43 , a weighted average life of 6.28 and modified duration of 5.36 years. 
 Deposits . Deposits held by our subsidiary bank represent our primary source of funding. Total deposits were 11.76 billion as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 10.72 billion as of September 30, 2023 and 11.14 billion as of December 31, 2023.

The estimated amount of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits including related accrued and unpaid interest is approximately 5.35 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Borrowings. Included in borrowings were federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB and other borrowings of 25.98 million, 129.75 million and 22.15 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average balance of federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB and other borrowings were 24.67 million and 54.12 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The weighted average interest rates paid on these borrowings were 1.87 and 3.80 for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average balance of federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB and other borrowings were 60.06 million and 82.34 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The weighted average interest rates paid on these borrowings were 3.66 and 3.97 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Repurchase Agreements. Securities sold under repurchase agreements of 57.56 million, 621.79 million and 381.93 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Securities sold under repurchase agreements are generally with significant customers of the Company that require short-term liquidity for their funds for which we pledge certain securities that have a fair value equal to at least the amount of the short-term borrowings. The average balances of securities sold under repurchase agreements were 100.89 million and 567.06 million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average rates paid on securities sold under repurchase agreements were 2.92 and 3.16 for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average balances of securities sold under repurchase agreements were 209.91 million and 571.45 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average rates paid on securities sold under repurchase agreements were 3.31 and 2.69 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average balances of securities sold under repurchase agreements has decreased from the prior year as customers have moved funds to IntraFi deposit accounts. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are different. Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through our strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that generate favorable earnings while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates. We use no off-balance-sheet financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. 
 Our subsidiary bank has an asset liability management committee that monitors interest rate risk and compliance with investment policies. The subsidiary bank utilizes an earnings simulation model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates. The model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net income over the next 
 56 

twelve months. The model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario of hypothetical fluctuations in interest rates over the next twelve months. These simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix, pricing and the re-pricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet. 
 The following analysis depicts the estimated impact on net interest income of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels for the periods presented.

The results for the net interest income simulations as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023 resulted in an asset sensitive position. These are good faith estimates and assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at each year-end will remain constant over the relevant twelve-month measurement period and that changes in market interest rates are instantaneous and sustained across the yield curve regardless of duration of pricing characteristics on specific assets or liabilities. Also, this analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates. We believe these estimates are not necessarily indicative of what actually could occur in the event of immediate interest rate increases or decreases of this magnitude. As interest-bearing assets and liabilities reprice in different time frames and proportions to market interest rate movements, various assumptions must be made based on historical relationships of these variables in reaching any conclusion. Since these correlations are based on competitive and market conditions, we anticipate that our future results will likely be different from the foregoing estimates, and such differences could be material. 
 Should we be unable to maintain a reasonable balance of maturities and repricing of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities, we could be required to dispose of our assets in an unfavorable manner or pay a higher than market rate to fund our activities. Our asset liability management committee oversees and monitors this risk. 
 The fair value of our investment securities classified as available-for-sale totaled 4.61 billion at September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the corresponding unrealized loss before taxes on the portfolio of 510.92 million at December 31, 2023, changed to an unrealized loss before taxes of 417.83 million at September 30, 2024, which is recorded net of taxes in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) in shareholders' equity. The unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, on the portfolio are excluded from the calculation of all regulatory capital ratios. The changes in the fair value were driven by changes in interest rates based on expected actions by the Federal Reserve Board and other market conditions. The overall valuation of the portfolio is most correlated to the 5-year U.S. Treasury rates based on the composition and duration of the portfolio. At September 30, 2024, the 5-year U.S. Treasury rate was 3.57 compared to 3.84 at December 31, 2023, representing a 27 basis point decrease during the first nine months of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, an increase of 100 basis points in the 5-year U.S. Treasury rate would result in an increase to unrealized losses by approximately 218 thousand before taxes, while a 100 basis point decrease in the same rate would result in a decrease to unrealized losses by approximately 183 thousand before taxes. We believe that we have the ability to hold these securities based on our overall liquidity and intent to hold the portfolio. 
 Capital and Liquidity 
 Capital. We evaluate capital resources by our ability to maintain adequate regulatory capital ratios to do business in the banking industry. Issues related to capital resources arise primarily when we are growing at an accelerated rate but not retaining a significant amount of our profits or when we experience significant asset quality deterioration. 
 Total shareholders equity was 1.66 billion, or 12.24 of total assets at September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.24 billion, or 9.71 of total assets at September 30, 2023, and 1.50 billion, or 11.44 of total assets at December 31, 2023. Included in shareholders' equity at September 30, 2024, and 2023, and December 31, 2023 were 329.82 million, 639.93 million and 403.30 million, respectively, in unrealized losses on investment securities available-for-sale, net of related income taxes, although such amount is excluded from and does not impact regulatory capital. For the third quarter of 2024, total shareholders equity averaged 1.57 billion, or 11.83 of average assets, as compared to 1.36 billion, or 10.58 of average assets, during the same period in 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, total shareholders' equity averaged 1.51 billion, or 11.42 of average assets, as compared to 1.34 billion, or 10.44 of average assets, during the same period in 2023. 
 Banking regulators measure capital adequacy by means of the risk-based capital ratios and the leverage ratio under the Basel III rules and prompt corrective action regulations. The risk-based capital rules provide for the weighting of assets and off-balance-sheet commitments and contingencies according to prescribed risk categories. Regulatory capital is then divided by risk-weighted assets to determine the risk-adjusted capital ratios. The leverage ratio is computed by dividing shareholders equity less intangible assets by quarter-to-date average assets less intangible assets. 
 Beginning in January 2015, under the Basel III rules, the implementation of the capital conservation buffer was effective for the Company starting at the 0.625 level and increasing 0.625 each year thereafter, until it reached 2.50 on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to 
 57 

absorb losses during periods of economic stress and requires increased capital levels for the purpose of capital distributions and other payments. Failure to meet the amount of the buffer will result in restrictions on the Company s ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023, we had a total risk-based capital ratio of 20.03 , 19.49 and 19.62 , a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 18.83 , 18.35 and 18.50 , a common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio of 18.83 , 18.35 and 18.50 and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.53 , 12.00 and 12.06 , respectively. The regulatory capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023 were calculated under Basel III rules. 
 The regulatory capital ratios of the Company and Bank under the Basel III regulatory capital framework are as follows:

In connection with the adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework, our subsidiary bank made the election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from available-for-sale securities AOCI from capital in connection with its quarterly financial filing and, in effect, to retain the AOCI treatment under the prior capital rules. 
 Liquidity. Liquidity is our ability to meet cash demands as they arise. Such needs can develop from loan demand, deposit withdrawals or acquisition opportunities. Potential obligations resulting from the issuance of standby letters of credit and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loan customers are other factors affecting our liquidity needs. Many of these obligations and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements affecting our liquidity position. The potential need for liquidity arising from these types of financial instruments is represented by the contractual notional amount of the instrument. Asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable, or which will mature in the near future. Liquid assets include cash, federal funds sold, and short-term investments in time deposits in banks. Liquidity is also provided by access to funding sources, which include core depositors and correspondent banks that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to our subsidiary bank. Other sources of funds include our ability to borrow from short-term sources, such as purchasing federal funds from correspondent banks, sales of securities under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings (see below) and an unfunded 25.00 million revolving line of credit established with Frost Bank, a nonaffiliated bank, which matures on June 30, 2025 (see next paragraph). Our subsidiary bank also has federal funds purchased lines of credit with two non-affiliated banks totaling 130.00 million. At September 30, 2024, there were no amounts drawn on these lines of credit. Our subsidiary bank also has (i) an available line of credit with the FHLB totaling 2.20 billion at September 30, 2024, secured by portions of our loan portfolio and certain investment securities, and (ii) access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas lending program secured by portions of certain investment securities. At September 30, 2024, there was 641.50 million used on the FHLB line advance for undisbursed commitments (letters of credit) used to secure public funds. 
 The Company renewed its loan agreement, effective June 30, 2023, with Frost Bank. Under the loan agreement, as renewed and amended, we are permitted to draw up to 25.00 million on a revolving line of credit. Prior to June 30, 2025, interest is paid quarterly at The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate and the line of credit matures June 30, 2025. If a balance exists at June 30, 2025, the principal balance converts to a term facility payable quarterly over five years and interest is paid quarterly at The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate. The line of credit is unsecured. Among other provisions in the credit agreement, we must satisfy certain financial covenants during the term of the loan agreement, including, without limitation, covenants that require us to maintain certain capital, loan loss reserve, non-performing asset and cash flow coverage ratios. In addition, the credit agreement contains certain operational covenants, which among others, restricts the payment of dividends above 55 of consolidated net income, limits the incurrence of debt (excluding any amounts acquired in an acquisition) and prohibits the disposal of assets except in the ordinary course of business. Since 1995, we have historically declared dividends as a percentage of our consolidated net income in a range of 36 (low) in 2021 and 2020 to 53 (high) in 2003 and 2006. The Company was in compliance with the financial and operational covenants at September 30, 2024. There was no outstanding balance under the line of credit as of September 30, 2024. 
 In addition, we anticipate that future acquisitions of financial institutions, expansion of branch locations or offerings of new products could also place a demand on our cash resources. Available cash and cash equivalents at our parent company which totaled 107.32 million at September 30, 2024, investment securities which totaled 2.16 million at September 30, 2024 and mature over 5 to 6 years, available dividends from our subsidiaries which totaled 375.30 million at September 30, 2024, utilization of available lines of credit, and future debt or equity offerings are expected to be the source of funding for these potential acquisitions or expansions. 
 Our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Liquidity risk management is an important element in our asset/liability management process. We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed potentially problematic by management. These scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs. As of September 30, 2024, management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. We are monitoring closely the impact to the financial system due to the recent failures of several banks. Given the diversified core deposit base and relatively low loan to deposit ratios maintained at our subsidiary bank, we consider our current liquidity position to be adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. In addition, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity that would have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Off-Balance Sheet OBS )/Reserve for Unfunded Commitments. We are a party to financial instruments with OBS risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include unfunded lines of credit, commitments to extend credit and federal funds sold to correspondent banks and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2024, the Company s reserve for unfunded commitments totaled 8.00 million which is recorded in other liabilities. 
 Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for unfunded lines of credit, commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments. We generally use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments. 
 Unfunded lines of credit and commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, as we deem necessary upon extension of credit, is based on our credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant, and equipment and income-producing commercial properties. 
 59 

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issue to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The average collateral value held on letters of credit usually exceeds the contract amount.

We believe we have no other OBS arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated, special purpose entities that would expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements. The above table does not include balances related to the Company s IRLC and forward mortgage-backed security trades. Total commercial commitments were 2.09 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.98 billion at September 30, 2023, and 1.92 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 Parent Company Funding . Our ability to fund various operating expenses, dividends, and cash acquisitions is generally dependent on our own earnings (without giving effect to our subsidiaries), cash reserves and funds derived from our subsidiaries. These funds historically have been produced by intercompany dividends and management fees that are limited to reimbursement of actual expenses. We anticipate that our recurring cash sources will continue to include dividends and management fees from our subsidiaries. At September 30, 2024, 375.30 million was available for the payment of intercompany dividends by our subsidiaries without the prior approval of regulatory agencies. Our subsidiaries paid aggregate dividends of 40.50 million and 97.50 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Dividends . Our long-term dividend policy is to pay cash dividends to our shareholders of approximately 35 to 40 of annual net earnings while maintaining adequate capital to support growth. We are also restricted by a loan covenant within our line of credit agreement with Frost Bank to dividend no greater than 55 of net income, as defined in such loan agreement. The cash dividend payout ratios have amounted to 47.89 and 49.48 of net earnings for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Given our current capital position, projected earnings and asset growth rates, we do not anticipate any significant change in our current dividend policy. 
 Our bank subsidiary, which was a national banking association until April 22, 2024, and a member of the Federal Reserve System, was required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the OCC to declare and pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of (i) such bank s net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for that year plus (ii) its retained net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. 
 To pay dividends, we and our subsidiary bank must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines and comply with the general requirements applicable to a Texas corporation. Generally, a Texas corporation may not pay a dividend to its shareholders if (i) after giving effect to the dividend, the corporation would be insolvent, or (ii) the amount of the dividend would exceed the surplus of the corporation. In addition, if the applicable regulatory authority believes that a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), the authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from the unsafe practice. The Federal Reserve, the FDIC, Texas Department of Banking, and the OCC have each indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve, Texas Department of Banking, the OCC and the FDIC expect that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Management considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk for the Company. See Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Interest Rate Risk for disclosure regarding this market risk. 
 60 

Item 4. Contr ols and Procedures. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our management, which includes our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded, based on our evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Subsequent to our evaluation, there were no significant changes in internal controls over financial reporting or other factors that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

A copy of the form of Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.5 and incorporated herein by reference, and the following summary of the Agreement is qualified entirely by reference to the text of the Agreement. 
 
 Each Employee s prior Executive Recognition Agreement, if applicable, expired on July 1, 2024, and was replaced by the Agreement. 
 
 The term of the Agreement commences effective July 1, 2024, and continues until the earliest to occur of (a) the Employee s death, disability or retirement, (b) the termination of the Employee s employment with the Company prior to a change in control (as defined in the Agreement) of the Company, or (c) June 30, 2026, however, on the Initial Expiration Date and on each subsequent second anniversary of the Initial Expiration Date, the Expiration Date shall automatically be postponed for two additional years unless written notice of non-extension of this Agreement is provided by the Company to the Employee at least sixty calendar days before the then-scheduled Expiration Date. Pursuant to the Agreement, if a change in control of the Company occurs during the term of the Agreement, the Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of two years from the date of any such change in control of the Company; and further, if a second change in control occurs within a period of two years from the date of the first change in control, the Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of two years from the date of the second change in control of the Company. If any benefit accrues and remains unpaid at the time the Agreement would otherwise have terminated, the Agreement will remain in effect until such benefit is paid in full solely for the purpose of permitting the Employee to enforce the full payment of such benefit. 
 
 62 

The Agreement provides that if a change in control of the Company occurs, the Employee shall be entitled to benefits (described below) upon the subsequent termination of the Employee s employment during the term of the Agreement, unless such termination is (a) because of the Employee s death, disability or retirement, (b) by the Company for cause (as defined in the Agreement), or (c) by the Employee other than for good reason (as defined in the Agreement). 
 
 The Agreement also provides that if, within twenty-four months following a change in control of the Company, the Company terminates the Employee for any reason other than for cause, death, disability or retirement, or the Employee terminates his employment for good reason, then the Company shall pay or provide to the Employee, no later than the 15th day of the third month following the Employee s date of termination, without regard to any contrary provisions of any applicable employee benefit plan, the following: (a) three-hundred percent (300 in the case of Mr. Dueser's annual base salary payable by the Company immediately preceding the Date of Termination or two-hundred percent (200 in the case of other executive officer's annual base salary payable by the Company immediately preceding the Date of Termination; (b) the targeted amount of the Employee's bonus prorated through the date of termination; and (c) a lump sum payment of the Employee's accrued but unused paid time off. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Employee is a key employee within the meaning of Section 416(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Employee has the right to receive a distribution as a result thereof, then the distribution to such key Employee upon termination of employment shall not commence earlier than six months following the date of termination. 
 
 Under the Agreement, if any payments or benefits to the Employee would constitute a parachute payment and would be subject to excise tax, then a calculation shall be made comparing (a) the net benefit to the Employee, after payment of such excise tax and all other federal, state, local, or foreign income, and employment taxes, to (b) the net benefit to the Employee if payments are limited to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the excise tax. Only if the amount calculated under (a) above is less than the amount under (b) above will the payments be reduced to the minimum extent necessary to ensure that no portion of the payment to the Employee is subject to the excise tax. As of the date of this report, based on projected parachute payment amounts, no Employee would incur an excise tax and all parachute payments per the net benefit calculation would be fully deductible by the Company.

The Employee shall be solely responsible for the payment of any taxes and penalties incurred under Section 409A of the Code. 
 		(v) The amount of any payment provided for in this Section 4 shall not be reduced, offset or subject to recovery by the Company by reason of any compensation earned by the Employee as the result of employment by another employer after the Date of Termination, or otherwise. 
 	5.	 Successors; Binding Agreement. 
 		(i) The Company will seek, by written request at least five (5) business days prior to the time a Person becomes a Successor (as hereinafter defined), to have such Person assent to the fulfillment of the Company s obligations under this Agreement. Failure of such Person to furnish such assent prior to the time such Person becomes a Successor shall constitute a condition for termination by the Employee of his/her employment for Good Reason under the provisions of Section 3(iv) of this Agreement, if a Change in Control of the Company occurs or has occurred. For purposes of this Agreement, Successor shall mean any Person that succeeds to, or has the practical ability to control (either immediately or with the passage of time), the Company s business directly, by merger, consolidation or purchase of assets, or indirectly, by purchase of the Company s voting securities or otherwise.

 		(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall include any corporation or other entity which is the surviving or continuing entity in respect of any merger, consolidation or form of business combination in which the Company ceases to exist. 
 	6.	 Fees and Expenses. The Company shall reimburse the Employee for all reasonable legal fees and related expenses, if any, incurred by the Employee in the successful enforcement of any right or benefit provided by this Agreement. 
 	7.	 Taxes. 
 		(i) All payments to be made to the Employee under this Agreement will be subject to required withholding of federal, state and local income and employment taxes. 
 		(ii) 
 
 		(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement to the contrary, if any of the payments or benefits provided or to be provided by the Company or a corporation which is a member of an affiliated group (as defined in Section 1504(a) of the Code without regard to Section 1504(b) of the Code) of which the Company is a member, to the Employee or for the Employee s benefit pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the Covered Payments would constitute a parachute payment (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), and would, but for this Section 7(ii) be subject to excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the 
 - 12 - 

Code (or any successor provision thereto) or any similar tax imposed by state or local law or any interest or penalties with respect to such taxes (collectively, the Excise Tax ), then prior to making the Covered Payments, a calculation shall be made comparing (i) the Net Benefit (as defined below) to the Employee of the Covered Payments after payment of the Excise Tax to (ii) the Net Benefit to the Employee if the Covered Payments are limited to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the Excise Tax. Only if the amount calculated under (i) above is less than the amount under (ii) above will the Covered Payments be reduced to the minimum extent necessary to ensure that no portion of the Covered Payments is subject to the Excise Tax (that amount, the Reduced Amount ). Net Benefit shall mean the present value of the Covered Payments net of all federal, state, local, foreign income, employment and excise taxes. 
 		(B) The Covered Payments shall be reduced in a manner that maximizes the Employee s economic position. In applying this principle, the reduction shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and where two economically equivalent amounts are subject to reduction but payable at different times, such amounts shall be reduced on a pro rata basis but not below zero. 
 		(C) Any determination required under this Section 7(ii) shall be made in writing in good faith by an independent accounting firm selected by the Company that is reasonably acceptable to the Employee (the Accountants ), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations to the Company and the Employee as requested by the Company or the Employee. The Company and the Employee shall provide the Accountants with such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a 
 - 13 - 

determination under this Section 7(ii). For purposes of making the calculations and determinations required by this Section 7(ii), the Accountants may rely on reasonable, good faith assumptions and approximations concerning the application of Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Code. The Accountants determinations shall be final and binding on the Company and the Employee. The Company shall be responsible for all fees and expenses incurred by the Accountants in connection with the calculations required by this Section 7(ii). 
 	8.	 Survival. The respective obligations of, and benefits afforded to, the Company and the Employee as provided in Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 and 15 of this Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement.

After termination of the Employee s employment with the Company, the Employee shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it.

 	12. Miscellaneous; Governing Law. No provision of this Agreement may be amended, waived or discharged following a Change in Control of the Company unless such amendment, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by all of the parties affected thereby.
