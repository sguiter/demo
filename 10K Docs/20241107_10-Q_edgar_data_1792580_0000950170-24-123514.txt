DEFINITIONS 
 Unless the context otherwise requires or otherwise expressly stated, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to Ovintiv, the Company, us, we, our, and ours refer to Ovintiv Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. In addition, the following are other abbreviations and definitions of certain terms used within this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q: 
 AECO means Alberta Energy Company and is the Canadian benchmark price for natural gas. 
 ASU means Accounting Standards Update. 
 bbl or bbls means barrel or barrels. 
 BOE means barrels of oil equivalent. 
 Btu means British thermal units, a measure of heating value. 
 CORRA means Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average. 
 DD A means depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses. 
 FASB means Financial Accounting Standards Board. 
 GHG means greenhouse gas. 
 Mbbls/d means thousand barrels per day. 
 MBOE/d means thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
 Mcf means thousand cubic feet. 
 MD A means Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 MMBOE means million barrels of oil equivalent. 
 MMBtu means million Btu. 
 MMcf/d means million cubic feet per day. 
 NCIB means normal course issuer bid. 
 NGL or NGLs means natural gas liquids. 
 NYMEX means New York Mercantile Exchange.

 CONVERSIONS 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a conversion of natural gas volumes to BOE is on the basis of six Mcf to one bbl. BOE is based on a generic energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent economic value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value, particularly if used in isolation. 
 CONVENTIONS 
 Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars, all references to dollars , or US are to U.S. dollars and all references to C are to Canadian dollars. All amounts are provided on a before tax basis, unless otherwise stated. In addition, all information provided herein is presented on an after royalties basis. 
 3 

The terms include , includes , including and included are to be construed as if they were immediately followed by the words without limitation , except where explicitly stated otherwise. 
 The term liquids is used to represent oil, NGLs and condensate. The term liquids rich is used to represent natural gas streams with associated liquids volumes. The term play is used to describe an area in which hydrocarbon accumulations or prospects of a given type occur. Ovintiv s focus of development is on hydrocarbon accumulations known to exist over a large areal expanse and/or thick vertical section and are developed using hydraulic fracturing. This type of development typically has a lower geological and/or commercial development risk and lower average decline rate, when compared to conventional development. 
 References to information contained on the Company s website at www.ovintiv.com are not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the other documents incorporated herein by reference (if any), contain certain forward-looking statements or information (collectively, forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements, except for statements of historical fact, that relate to the anticipated future activities, plans, strategies, objectives or expectations of the Company are forward-looking statements. When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q, and the other documents incorporated herein by reference (if any), the use of words and phrases including anticipates, believes, continue, could, estimates, expects, focused on, forecast, guidance, intends, maintain, may, opportunities, outlook, plans, potential, strategy, targets, will, would and other similar terminology is intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words or phrases. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q include: expectations of plans, strategies and objectives of the Company, including anticipated reserves development; the Company s ability to consummate any future acquisition and divestiture transactions; the Company s ability to successfully integrate any acquired assets into its business; drilling plans and programs, including the amount and availability of capital to complete these plans and programs; the composition of the Company s assets and the anticipated capital returns associated with its assets; anticipated oil, NGL and natural gas prices; the anticipated success of, and benefits from, technology and innovation, including the cube development model, Trimulfrac and Simulfrac techniques and other new or advanced drilling techniques or well completion designs; anticipated drilling and completions activity, including the number of drilling rigs and frac crews utilized; anticipated proceeds and future benefits from various joint venture, partnership and other agreements; anticipated oil, NGLs and natural gas production and commodity mix; the Company s ability to access credit facilities, debt and equity capital markets and other sources of liquidity; the ability of the Company to timely achieve its stated environmental, social and governance goals, targets and initiatives; the impact of changes in federal, state, provincial, local and tribal laws, rules and regulations; anticipated compliance with current or proposed environmental legislation; the Company s ability to manage debt and financial ratios and comply with financial covenants; the implementation and outcomes of risk management programs, including exposure to commodity prices, interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations and the volume of oil, NGLs and natural gas production hedged; the declaration and payment of future dividends and the anticipated repurchase of the Company s outstanding common shares; the Company s ability to manage cost inflation and expected cost structures, including expected operating, transportation, processing and labor expenses; and the outlook of the oil and natural gas industry generally, including impacts from changes to the geopolitical environment. 
 
 The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We have based these forward-looking statements on current expectations and assumptions about future events, taking into account all information currently known by us. While we consider these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and beyond our control. The risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations, performance and results of our business and forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other risks and uncertainties impacting the Company s business as described from time to time in the Company s other periodic filings with the SEC or Canadian securities regulators. 
 4 

Although the Company believes the expectations represented by its forward-looking statements are reasonable based on the information available to it as of the date such statements are made, forward-looking statements are only predictions and statements of our current beliefs and there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. All forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q are made as of the date of this document (or in the case of a document incorporated herein by reference, the date of such document) and, except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q, and all subsequent forward-looking statements attributable to the Company, whether written or oral, are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. 
 
 The reader should carefully read the risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10 K for a description of certain risks that could, among other things, cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements.

, Ovintiv ASU 2023-07 Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , issued by FASB. The amendments enhance annual disclosure requirements about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within reported measures of segment profit or loss. The amendments do not change how an entity identifies its operating segments. In addition, all annual disclosures are to be presented in all future interim periods beginning in the first quarter of 2025. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the annual and interim disclosures and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. New Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted As of January 1, 2025, Ovintiv will be required to adopt ASU 2023-09 Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . The standard requires disaggregated information about the Company s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The amendment requires the tabular rate reconciliation to be presented using both percentages and amounts, with additional separate disclosure for any reconciling items within certain categories equal to or greater than five percent of net earnings or loss before income tax and the applicable statutory federal income tax rate. The amendment also requires the disaggregation of income taxes paid by federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions, as well as additional disaggregated information on income taxes paid to an individual jurisdiction equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid. Amendments will be applied prospectively at the date of adoption and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.

As at September 30, 2024, receivables and accrued revenues from contracts with customers were million million as at December 31, 2023). Ovintiv s product sales are sold under short-term contracts with terms that are less than one year at either fixed or market index prices or under long-term contracts exceeding one year at market index prices. The Company s gathering and processing services are provided on an interruptible basis with transaction prices that are for fixed prices and/or variable consideration. Variable consideration received is related to recovery of plant operating costs or escalation of the fixed price based on a consumer price index. As the service contracts are interruptible, with service provided on an as available basis, there are unsatisfied performance obligations remaining at September 30, 2024. As at September 30, 2024, all remaining performance obligations are priced at market index prices or are variable volume delivery contracts. As such, the variable consideration is allocated entirely to the wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or promise to deliver units of production, and revenue is recognized at the amount for which the Company has the right to invoice the product delivered. In addition, Ovintiv does not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations for customer contracts with terms less than 12 months or for variable consideration related to unsatisfied performance obligations.

Effective Tax Rate 

() 

Ovintiv s interim income tax expense is determined using the estimated annual effective income tax rate applied to year-to-date net earnings before income tax plus the effect of legislative changes and amounts in respect of prior periods. The estimated annual effective income tax rate is impacted by expected annual earnings, changes in valuation allowances, income tax related to foreign operations, state taxes, the effect of legislative changes, non-taxable items and tax differences on transactions, which can produce interim effective tax rate fluctuations. The effective tax rate of percent and percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of percent primarily due to changes related to prior year s tax filings. The effective tax rate of percent and percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of percent primarily due to the recognition of U.S. federal and state research and development credits.

billion and issued approximately million shares of Ovintiv common stock, representing a value of approximately billion. The cash portion of the consideration was funded through a combination of net proceeds from the Company s May 2023 senior notes offering, net proceeds from the sale of Bakken during the second quarter of 2023, cash on hand and proceeds from short-term borrowings. During the period from June 12, 2023 to December 31, 2023, transaction costs of approximately million were included in administrative expense. The acquisition was strategically located in close proximity to Ovintiv s current Permian operations and added approximately net well locations to Ovintiv s Permian inventory and approximately net acres. The results of operations from the acquired Permian assets have been included in Ovintiv s consolidated financial statements since June 12, 2023.

(1) The fair value was based on the issuance of million shares of common stock using the NYSE price of on June 12, 2023. 

 (2) Cash consideration paid includes final cash settlements of million which were completed during the first quarter of 2024. 

 (3) Since the completion of the business combination on June 12, 2023, additional information related to pre-acquisition assets and liabilities was obtained resulting in measurement period adjustments. Changes in the fair value estimates comprised an increase in accounts receivable and accrued revenues of million, an increase in proved properties of million, a decrease in unproved properties of million, a decrease in other property, plant and equipment of million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and a decrease in other liabilities and provisions of million. 

The Company used the income approach valuation technique for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values due to their nature and/or short-term maturity of the instruments. The fair value of tubular inventory in other property, plant and equipment was based on the fair value approach, which utilized subsequent sales of inventory, asset listings and cost records with consideration for the relative age, condition, utilization and economic support of the inventory. The fair values of the proved properties, unproved properties and asset retirement obligation were categorized within Level 3 and were determined using relevant market assumptions, including discount rates, future commodity prices and costs, timing of development activities, projections of oil and gas reserves, and estimates to abandon and reclaim producing wells. Level 3 inputs require significant judgment and estimates to be made. For income tax purposes, the Permian Acquisition was treated as an asset purchase, and as a result, the tax basis in the assets and liabilities reflect their allocated fair value.

MMcf/d of natural gas gathering and compression and MMcf/d of natural gas processing under long-term service agreements with remaining terms ranging from seven to and have various renewal terms providing up to a potential maximum of years. Ovintiv has determined that VMLP is a variable interest entity and that Ovintiv holds variable interests in VMLP. Ovintiv is not the primary beneficiary as the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact VMLP s economic performance. These key activities relate to the construction, operation, maintenance and marketing of the assets owned by VMLP. The variable interests arise from certain terms under the various long-term service agreements and include: i) a take or pay for volumes in certain agreements; ii) an operating fee of which a portion can be converted into a fixed fee once VMLP assumes operatorship of certain assets; and iii) a potential payout of minimum costs in certain agreements. The potential payout of minimum costs will be assessed in the eighth year of the assets service period and is based on whether there is an overall shortfall of total system cash flows from natural gas gathered and compressed under certain agreements. The potential payout amount can be reduced in the event VMLP markets unutilized capacity to third-party users. Ovintiv is not required to provide any financial support or guarantees to VMLP. As a result of Ovintiv s involvement with VMLP, the maximum total exposure to loss related to the commitments under the agreements is estimated to be million as at September 30, 2024. The estimate comprises the take or pay volume commitments and the potential payout of minimum costs. The take or pay volume commitments associated with certain gathering and processing assets are included in Note 21 under Transportation and Processing. The potential payout requirement is highly uncertain as the amount is contingent on future production estimates, pace of development and downstream transportation constraints. As at September 30, 2024, accounts payable and accrued liabilities included million related to the take or pay commitment.

C) Credit Risk Credit risk arises from the potential that the Company may incur a loss if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its obligation in accordance with agreed terms. While exchange-traded contracts are subject to nominal credit risk due to the financial safeguards established by the exchanges and clearing agencies, over-the-counter traded contracts expose Ovintiv to counterparty credit risk. Counterparties to the Company s derivative financial instruments consist primarily of major financial institutions and companies within the energy industry. This credit risk exposure is mitigated through the use of credit policies approved by the Board of Directors governing the Company s credit portfolio including credit practices that limit transactions according to counterparties credit quality. Mitigation strategies may include master netting arrangements, requesting collateral, purchasing credit insurance and/or transacting credit derivatives. The Company executes commodity derivative financial instruments under master agreements that have netting provisions that provide for offsetting payables against receivables. Ovintiv actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, assigns appropriate credit limits and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits. As at September 30, 2024, Ovintiv s maximum exposure of loss due to credit risk from derivative financial instrument assets on a gross and net fair value basis was million and million, respectively, as disclosed in Note 18. The Company had significant credit derivatives in place and held collateral at September 30, 2024. Any cash equivalents include high-grade, short-term securities, placed primarily with financial institutions with investment grade ratings. Any foreign currency agreements entered into are with major financial institutions that have investment grade credit ratings. A substantial portion of the Company s accounts receivable are with customers and working interest owners in the oil and gas industry and are subject to normal industry credit risks. As at September 30, 2024, approximately percent percent as at December 31, 2023) of Ovintiv s accounts receivable and financial derivative credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties. During 2015 and 2017, the Company entered into agreements resulting from divestitures, which required Ovintiv to fulfill certain payment obligations on the take or pay volume commitments assumed by the purchasers. The circumstances that would require Ovintiv to perform under the agreements included events where a purchaser failed to make payment to the guaranteed party and/or a purchaser was subject to an insolvency event. The agreements had a fair value of million as at December 31, 2023 and expired in .

 For additional information on Ovintiv s strategy, its reporting segments and the plays in which the Company operates, refer to Items 1 and 2 of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 In evaluating its operations and assessing its leverage, Ovintiv reviews performance-based measures such as Non GAAP Cash Flow and debt-based metrics such as Debt to Adjusted Capitalization, Debt to EBITDA and Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures and do not have any standardized meaning under U.S. GAAP. These measures may not be similar to measures presented by other issuers and should not be viewed as a substitute for measures reported under U.S. GAAP. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliations to the closest GAAP measure, can be found in the Non-GAAP Measures section of this MD A.

Highlights 
 During the first nine months of 2024, the Company focused on executing its 2024 capital investment plan aimed at maximizing profitability through operational and capital efficiencies, and delivering cash from operating activities. Lower upstream product revenues in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily resulted from lower average realized natural gas prices, excluding the impact of risk management activities, partially offset by higher total production volumes. Decreases in average realized natural gas prices of 44 percent were primarily due to lower benchmark prices. Total production volumes increased six percent compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to the addition of the Permian assets acquired in the second quarter of 2023. Ovintiv continues to focus on optimizing realized prices from the diversification of the Company s downstream markets. 
 Significant Development 
 On September 26, 2024, the Company announced it had received regulatory approval for the renewal of its NCIB program, which enables the Company to purchase, for cancellation or return to treasury, up to approximately 25.9 million shares of common stock over a 12-month period from October 3, 2024 to October 2, 2025.

 2024 Outlook 
 Industry Outlook 
 Oil Markets 
 The oil and gas industry is cyclical and commodity prices are inherently volatile. Oil prices reflect global supply and demand dynamics as well as the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. 
 Oil prices for the remainder of 2024 are expected to be impacted by the interplay between the pace of global economic growth and demand for oil, OPEC+ production levels and continued supply uncertainties resulting from geopolitical events. Recessionary concerns continue to have an impact on global demand outlooks as central banks evaluate and recalibrate their strategies in response to the prevailing economic environment. Supply and the accumulation of global oil inventories are expected to be impacted by changes in OPEC+ production levels, consumer demand behavior and geopolitical volatility. 
 Natural Gas Markets 
 Natural gas prices are primarily impacted by structural changes in supply and demand, deviations from seasonally normal weather, as well as volatility in regional markets. 
 Natural gas benchmark prices for the remainder of 2024 are expected to be impacted by the interplay between natural gas production and associated natural gas from oil production, changes in demand from the power generation sector, changes in export levels of U.S. liquefied natural gas, impacts from seasonal weather, as well as supply chain constraints or other disruptions resulting from geopolitical events. 
 37 

Company Outlook 
 The Company will continue to exercise discretion and discipline, and intends to optimize capital allocation through the remainder of 2024 as the commodity price environment evolves. Ovintiv pursues innovative ways to maximize cash flows and to reduce upstream operating and administrative expenses. 
 Markets for oil and natural gas are exposed to different price risks and are inherently volatile. To mitigate price volatility and provide more certainty around cash flows, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments. As at September 30, 2024, the Company has hedged approximately 50.0 Mbbls/d of expected oil production and 800 MMcf/d of expected natural gas production for the remainder of the year. In addition, Ovintiv proactively utilizes transportation contracts to diversify the Company s sales markets, thereby reducing significant exposure to any given market and regional pricing. 
 Additional information on Ovintiv s hedging program can be found in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Capital Investment 
 The Company continues to execute its 2024 capital investment program, focusing on maximizing returns from high-margin oil and condensate, and generating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company invested 538 million, near the lower end of its third quarter guidance of 530 million to 570 million. In November, the Company narrowed its full year 2024 capital investment guidance range to 2,275 million to 2,325 million. 
 Ovintiv continually strives to improve well performance and lower costs through innovative techniques. Ovintiv s large-scale cube development model utilizes multi-well pads and advanced completion designs to maximize returns and resource recovery from its reservoirs. The Company continues to enhance its multi-frac technology by shifting, where possible, from simultaneously fracing two wells Simulfrac to fracing three wells Trimulfrac at the same time. Ovintiv s disciplined capital program and continuous innovation create flexibility to allocate capital in changing commodity markets to maximize cash flows while preserving the long-term value of the Company s multi-basin portfolio. 
 Production 
 During the third quarter of 2024, total average production volumes were 592.6 MBOE/d, which exceeded the third quarter guidance range of 565.0 MBOE/d to 580.0 MBOE/d, primarily due to the impact of lower than expected royalty rates in the Canadian Operations resulting from lower natural gas benchmark prices. Average oil and plant condensate production volumes were 212.4 Mbbls/d, average other NGL production volumes were 92.6 Mbbls/d and average natural gas production volumes were 1,725 MMcf/d, which exceeded third quarter guidance ranges of 204.0 Mbbls/d to 208.0 Mbbls/d, 88.0 Mbbls/d to 92.0 Mbbls/d and 1,640 MMcf/d to 1,690 MMcf/d, respectively. 
 In November, the Company further updated its full year 2024 total production guidance range to 583.0 MBOE/d to 587.0 MBOE/d, including oil and plant condensate production volumes of approximately 209.0 Mbbls/d to 211.0 Mbbls/d, other NGLs production volumes of approximately 91.0 Mbbls/d to 92.0 Mbbls/d and natural gas production volumes of approximately 1,700 MMcf/d to 1,715 MMcf/d. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Ovintiv promotes a collaborative culture that values knowledge exchange, open communication, continuous improvement and learning. This culture stimulates innovation and fosters the creation of best practices resulting in efficiency improvements and enhanced operational performance for the Company. 
 The Company is on track to achieve its full year upstream transportation and processing cost guidance range of approximately 7.50 per BOE to 8.00 per BOE, based on commodity price assumptions of 75.00 per barrel for WTI oil and 2.50 per MMBtu for NYMEX natural gas. Upstream transportation and processing costs of 7.31 per BOE during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was lower than guidance, primarily due to lower than expected natural gas commodity prices. 
 38 

The Company is also on track to meet the full year guidance range for operating expenses of approximately 4.25 per BOE to 4.75 per BOE, and total production, mineral and other taxes of approximately four to five percent of upstream product revenues. The Company s upstream operations refers to the summation of the USA and Canadian operating segments. 
 Additional information on Ovintiv s fourth quarter and updated full year 2024 Corporate Guidance can be accessed on the Company s website at www.ovintiv.com . 
 Environmental, Social and Governance 
 Ovintiv recognizes climate change as a global concern and the importance of reducing its environmental footprint as part of the solution. The Company voluntarily participates in emission reduction programs and has adopted a range of strategies to help reduce emissions from its operations. These strategies include incorporating new and proven technologies, optimizing processes in its operations and working closely with third-party providers to develop best practices. The Company continues to look for innovative techniques and efficiencies in support of its commitment to emission reductions. 
 In May 2024, Ovintiv published its 2023 Sustainability Report. The report highlights the Company s 2023 environmental, social and governance results, and its progress in emissions intensity reductions with the goal to meet its Scope 1 2 GHG emissions target by 2030. As at the end of 2023, the Company had achieved a greater than 40 percent reduction in the Scope 1 2 GHG emissions intensity from 2019 levels and is on track to meet its emissions intensity reduction target of 50 percent by 2030 measured against the 2019 baseline. The GHG emissions reduction target is tied to the annual compensation program for all employees. 
 During the second quarter of 2023, the Company acquired assets in Permian which increased both oil production volumes and net premium well inventory. Ovintiv is undergoing an integration period to align the emissions profile of the acquired inventory with the World Bank Zero Routine Flaring initiative. Ovintiv remains committed to its emissions reduction targets. 
 Ovintiv is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion. The Company s social commitment framework, which is rooted in the Company s foundational values of integrity, safety, sustainability, trust and respect, reflects Ovintiv s positive contributions to the communities where it operates and highlights the Company s approach to enabling an inclusive culture that embraces diversity of thought, background and experience. 
 Ovintiv remains committed to protecting the health and safety of its workforce. Safety is a foundational value at Ovintiv and plays a critical role in the Company s belief that a safe workplace is a strong indicator of a well-managed business. This safety-oriented mindset enables the Company to quickly respond to emergencies and minimize any impacts to employees and business continuity. Safety performance goals are incorporated into the Company s annual compensation program. Additional information on talent management and employee safety can be found in the Human Capital section of Items 1 and 2 of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Additional information on Ovintiv s sustainable business practices are included in its most recent Sustainability Report on the Company s sustainability website at https://sustainability.ovintiv.com .

Revenues 
 Ovintiv s revenues are substantially derived from sales of oil, NGLs and natural gas production. Increases or decreases in Ovintiv s revenue, profitability and future production are highly dependent on the commodity prices the Company receives. Prices are market driven and fluctuate due to factors beyond the Company s control, such as supply and demand, seasonality and geopolitical and economic factors. The Company s realized prices generally reflect WTI, NYMEX, Edmonton Condensate and AECO benchmark prices, as well as other downstream benchmarks, including Houston and Dawn. The Company proactively mitigates price risk and optimizes margins by entering into firm transportation contracts to diversify market access to different sales points. Realized prices, excluding the impact of risk management activities, may differ from the benchmarks for many reasons, including quality, location, or production being sold at different market hubs. 
 Benchmark prices relevant to the Company are shown in the table below.

(1) Revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 exclude certain other revenue and royalty adjustments with no associated production volumes of 1 million and 1 million, respectively. 

Oil Revenues 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 versus September 30, 2023 
 Oil revenues were lower by 133 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to: 
 A decrease of 7.47 per bbl, or nine percent, in the average realized oil prices which decreased revenues by 120 million. The decrease reflected lower Houston and WTI benchmark prices which were both down nine percent, and lower regional pricing relative to the benchmark prices. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus September 30, 2023 
 Oil revenues were higher by 446 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to: 
 Higher average oil production volumes of 21.6 Mbbls/d increased revenues by 466 million. Higher volumes were primarily due to the Permian assets acquired in the second quarter of 2023 (28.2 Mbbls/d) and successful drilling in Uinta and Permian (15.9 Mbbls/d), partially offset by the sale of the Bakken assets in the second quarter of 2023 (12.5 Mbbls/d) and natural declines in Anadarko (9.7 Mbbls/d). 

NGL Revenues 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 versus September 30, 2023 
 NGL revenues were lower by 5 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to: 
 A decrease of 4.31 per bbl, or six percent, in the average realized plant condensate prices which decreased revenues by 19 million. The decrease reflected the lower Edmonton Condensate benchmark price which was down seven percent; and 

Higher average other NGL volumes of 5.9 Mbbls/d increased revenues by 9 million. Higher volumes were primarily due to successful drilling in Permian, Uinta and Montney (8.8 Mbbls/d) and third-party plant outages and pipeline restrictions in Montney in 2023 (1.3 Mbbls/d), partially offset by natural declines in Anadarko and Montney (4.5 Mbbls/d). 

42 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus September 30, 2023 
 NGL revenues were higher by 47 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to: 
 An increase of 1.31 per bbl, or seven percent, in the average realized other NGL prices which increased revenues by 34 million. The increase reflected higher regional pricing and Other NGL benchmark prices; 

Higher average plant condensate production volumes of 1.1 Mbbls/d increased revenues by 26 million. Higher volumes were primarily due to successful drilling in Montney and Permian (2.5 Mbbls/d), partially offset by natural declines in Montney and Anadarko (1.6 Mbbls/d); and 

A decrease of 1.44 per bbl, or two percent, in the average realized plant condensate prices decreased revenues by 19 million. The decrease reflected the lower Edmonton Condensate benchmark price which was down three percent. 

Natural Gas Revenues 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 versus September 30, 2023 
 Natural gas revenues were lower by 143 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to: 
 A decrease of 1.04 per Mcf, or 45 percent, in the average realized natural gas prices which decreased revenues by 164 million. The decrease reflected lower AECO, Dawn and NYMEX benchmark prices which were down 66 percent, 24 percent and 15 percent, respectively, and lower regional pricing relative to benchmark prices; and 

Higher average natural gas production volumes of 100 MMcf/d increased revenues by 21 million. Higher volumes were primarily due to successful drilling in Permian, Montney and Uinta (78 MMcf/d), third-party plant outages and pipeline restrictions in Montney in 2023 (57 MMcf/d), and lower effective royalty rates in Montney resulting from lower commodity prices (18 MMcf/d). The higher production volumes were partially offset by natural declines in Anadarko and Montney (29 MMcf/d), and the shut-in of production in Other Canadian Operations in the third quarter of 2024 due to low commodity prices (22 MMcf/d). 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus September 30, 2023 
 Natural gas revenues were lower by 524 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to: 
 A decrease of 1.23 per Mcf, or 44 percent, in the average realized natural gas prices which decreased revenues by 577 million. The decrease reflected lower AECO, NYMEX and Dawn benchmark prices which were down 53 percent, 22 percent and 16 percent, respectively, and lower regional pricing relative to benchmark prices in the USA Operations; and 

Higher average natural gas production volumes of 63 MMcf/d increased revenues by 53 million. Higher volumes were primarily due to successful drilling in Permian and Montney (63 MMcf/d), lower effective royalty rates resulting from lower commodity prices in Montney (61 MMcf/d), and the Permian assets acquired in the second quarter of 2023 (16 MMcf/d). The higher production volumes were partially offset by the sale of the Bakken assets in the second quarter of 2023 (33 MMcf/d), natural declines in Anadarko (17 MMcf/d), and the shut-in of production in Other Canadian Operations beginning in the second quarter of 2024 due to low commodity prices (18 MMcf/d).

Depreciation, Depletion Amortization 
 Proved properties within each country cost center are depleted using the unit-of-production method based on proved reserves as discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Depletion rates are impacted by impairments, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange rates, as well as fluctuations in 12-month average trailing prices which affect proved reserves volumes. Corporate assets are carried at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the assets. 
 
 Additional information can be found under Upstream Assets and Reserve Estimates in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD A included in Item 7 of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The depletion rate in the USA Operations increased 3.96 per BOE compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to a higher depletable base. 
 Full Cost Accounting and Ceiling Test Impairments 
 Under full cost accounting, the carrying amount of Ovintiv s oil and natural gas properties within each country cost center is subject to a ceiling test performed quarterly. Ceiling test impairments are recognized when the capitalized costs, net of accumulated depletion and the related deferred income taxes, exceed the sum of the estimated after-tax future net cash flows from proved reserves as calculated under SEC requirements using the 12-month average trailing prices and discounted at 10 percent. The 12 month average trailing price is calculated as the average of the price on the first day of each month within the trailing 12 month period. 
 The Company did not recognize ceiling test impairments during the first nine months of 2024, however during this period, the 12-month average trailing prices have generally declined. Further declines in the 12 month average trailing commodity prices could reduce proved reserves values and result in the recognition of future ceiling test impairments. Future ceiling test impairments can also result from changes to reserves estimates, future development costs, capitalized costs and unproved property costs. Proceeds received from oil and natural gas divestitures are typically deducted from the Company s capitalized costs and can reduce the risk of ceiling test impairments. 
 Administrative 
 Administrative expense represents costs associated with corporate functions provided by Ovintiv staff. These expenses primarily include salaries and benefits, operating lease, office, information technology, legal and long-term incentive costs.

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus September 30, 2023 
 Net foreign exchange gain of 21 million compared to nil during the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to: 
 Realized foreign exchange gains on the settlement of intercompany notes compared to losses in 2023 15 million), higher unrealized foreign exchange gains on the translation of intercompany notes 14 million), and lower realized foreign exchange losses on the settlement of U.S. dollar risk management contracts issued from Canada 6 million); 

partially offset by: 
 Unrealized foreign exchange losses on the translation of U.S. dollar risk management contracts issued from Canada compared to gains in 2023 16 million). 

50 

Other (Gains) Losses, Net 
 Other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes other non-recurring revenues or expenses and may also include items such as interest income, interest received from tax authorities, reclamation charges relating to decommissioned assets, and adjustments related to other assets. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, the Company resolved a dispute related to the previous disposition of certain legacy assets for approximately 150 million. On September 30, 2024, the Company received 50 million of the settlement proceeds in escrow as restricted cash and Ovintiv expects to receive the remaining 100 million of the proceeds by the end of the year. Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company recognized a gain of 150 million in Other (gains) losses, net related to this dispute resolution. 
 Income Tax 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, current income tax expense in the U.S. of 16 million and 40 million, respectively, is higher than the comparative periods in 2023 primarily due to the impact of the corporate alternative minimum tax. In Canada, the current income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, of 14 million and 45 million, respectively, is lower than the comparative periods in 2023 due to lower expected full year taxable earnings. 
 The determination of income and other tax liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries requires interpretation of complex domestic and foreign tax laws and regulations, that are subject to change. The Company s interpretation of tax laws may differ from the interpretation of the tax authorities. As a result, there are tax matters under review for which the timing of resolution is uncertain. The Company believes that the provision for income taxes is adequate. 
 On June 20, 2024, Canada enacted its Global Minimum Tax Act GMTA ), which implements the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Pillar II framework, providing a global minimum tax rate of 15 percent. The Company continues to evaluate the GMTA but does not anticipate any material impact in 2024. 
 Additional information on income taxes can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources of Liquidity 
 The Company has the flexibility to access cash equivalents and a range of funding alternatives at competitive rates through committed revolving credit facilities as well as debt and equity capital markets. Ovintiv closely monitors the accessibility of cost-effective credit and ensures that sufficient liquidity is in place to fund capital expenditures and dividend payments. In addition, the Company may use cash and cash equivalents, cash from operating activities, or proceeds from asset divestitures to fund its operations and capital allocation framework or to manage its capital structure as discussed below. 
 The Company s capital structure consists of total shareholders equity plus long-term debt, including any current portion. The Company s objectives when managing its capital structure are to maintain financial flexibility to preserve Ovintiv s access to capital markets and its ability to meet financial obligations and finance internally generated growth, as well as potential acquisitions. Ovintiv has a practice of maintaining capital discipline and strategically managing its capital structure by adjusting capital spending, adjusting dividends paid to shareholders, issuing new shares of common stock, purchasing shares of common stock for cancellation or return to treasury, issuing new debt and repaying or repurchasing existing debt.

At September 30, 2024, Ovintiv also had approximately 72 million in undrawn letters of credit issued in the normal course of business primarily as collateral security related to sales arrangements. 
 Ovintiv has a U.S. shelf registration statement under which the Company may issue from time to time, debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, units, share purchase contracts and share purchase units in the U.S. The U.S. shelf registration statement expires in March 2026. 
 The obligations under the Company s existing debt securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Ovintiv Canada ULC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

 Ovintiv is currently in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facilities. Management monitors Debt to Adjusted Capitalization, which is a non-GAAP measure defined in the Non-GAAP Measures section of this MD A, as a proxy for Ovintiv s financial covenant under the Credit Facilities, which requires Debt to Adjusted Capitalization to be less than 60 percent. As at September 30, 2024, the Company s Debt to Adjusted Capitalization was 24 percent. The definitions used in the covenant under the Credit Facilities adjust capitalization for cumulative historical ceiling test impairments recorded in conjunction with the Company s January 1, 2012 adoption of U.S. GAAP. Additional information on financial covenants can be found in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10 K.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 1,022 million and 2,701 million, respectively, and was primarily a reflection of the impacts from production volumes, average realized commodity prices, realized gains/losses on risk management and changes in non cash working capital. 
 Additional detail on changes in non-cash working capital can be found in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Ovintiv expects it will continue to meet the payment terms of its suppliers. 
 Non-GAAP Cash Flow in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 978 million and 3,038 million, respectively, and was primarily impacted by the items affecting cash from operating activities which are discussed below and in the Results of Operations section of this MD A. 
 53 

Three months ended September 30, 2024 versus September 30, 2023 
 Net cash from operating activities increased 116 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to: 
 Changes in non-cash working capital 217 million), higher realized gains on risk management in revenues compared to 2023 87 million), a decrease in current income tax expense 35 million), lower transportation and processing expense 25 million), higher production volumes 21 million), and lower operating expense, excluding non-cash long-term incentive costs 9 million); 

partially offset by: 
 Lower realized commodity prices 302 million). 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus September 30, 2023 
 Net cash from operating activities decreased 104 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to: 
 Lower realized commodity prices 582 million), changes in non-cash working capital 476 million), higher operating expense, excluding non-cash long-term incentive costs 97 million) and higher interest expense 57 million); 

partially offset by: 
 Higher production volumes 551 million), realized gains on risk management in revenues compared to losses in 2023 273 million), lower transportation and processing expense 100 million), a decrease in current income tax expense 96 million), and lower administrative expense, excluding non-cash long-term incentive costs 84 million). 

Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was 1,918 million primarily due to capital expenditures and acquisitions in the USA Operations. Capital expenditures, and acquisition and divestiture activities are summarized in Notes 3 and 8, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. 
 Capital expenditures decreased 333 million compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to decreased completions activity in Montney, Anadarko and Permian, the sale of the Bakken assets in the second quarter of 2023, and drilling efficiencies in Uinta, partially offset by increased completions activity in Uinta. 
 Acquisitions in the first nine months of 2024 were 202 million, which primarily included property purchases with oil and liquids-rich potential in the USA Operations (2023 - 273 million). 
 Corporate acquisitions in the first nine months of 2024 includes the final cash settlements of 12 million completed in the first quarter of 2024 related to the Permian assets acquired in the second quarter of 2023. Additional information regarding the Permian Acquisition can be found in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash from and/or used in financing activities has been impacted by Ovintiv s strategic objective to return value to shareholders by repaying or repurchasing existing debt, purchasing shares of common stock and paying dividends. 
 Net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was 727 million compared to net cash from financing activities in 2023 of 1,921 million. The change was primarily due to the net issuance of long-term debt in 2023 of 2,278 million, increased purchases of shares of common stock in 2024 compared to 2023 224 million), and a decrease in the net issuance of revolving debt 176 million). 
 From time to time, Ovintiv may seek to retire or purchase the Company s outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 
 54 

The Company s long-term debt, including the current portion of 1,024 million, totaled 5,877 million at September 30, 2024. The Company s long-term debt at December 31, 2023, including the current portion of 284 million, totaled 5,737 million. As at September 30, 2024, the Company has 600 million of fixed rate long-term debt due within the next year. 
 In support of the Company s commitment to enhancing shareholder value, Ovintiv utilizes its capital allocation framework to provide competitive returns to shareholders while strengthening its balance sheet. Ovintiv expects to continue to deliver shareholder returns through share buybacks. 
 For additional information on long-term debt, refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Further details on the Company s debt-based metrics can be found in the Non-GAAP measures section of this MD A.

 Normal Course Issuer Bid 
 On September 26, 2024, the Company announced it had received regulatory approval for the renewal of its NCIB program, which enables the Company to purchase, for cancellation or return to treasury, up to approximately 25.9 million shares of common stock over a 12-month period from October 3, 2024 to October 2, 2025. The number of shares authorized for purchase represents 10 percent of Ovintiv s public float as at September 20, 2024. The Company expects to continue to execute the renewed NCIB program in conjunction with its capital allocation framework. 
 In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, under the previous NCIB program, which extended from October 3, 2023 to October 2, 2024, the Company purchased, for cancellation, approximately 3.7 million and 12.7 million shares of common stock, respectively, for total consideration of approximately 163 million and 597 million, respectively.

Non-GAAP Measures 

Certain measures in this document do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers and should not be viewed as a substitute for measures reported under U.S. GAAP. These measures are commonly used in the oil and gas industry and by Ovintiv to provide shareholders and potential investors with additional information regarding the Company s liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations. Non-GAAP measures include: Non-GAAP Cash Flow, Debt to Adjusted Capitalization, Debt to EBITDA and Debt to Adjusted EBITDA. Management s use of these measures is discussed further below. 
 Cash from Operating Activities and Non-GAAP Cash Flow 
 Non-GAAP Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash from (used in) operating activities excluding net change in other assets and liabilities, and net change in non-cash working capital. 
 Management believes this measure is useful to the Company and its investors as a measure of operating and financial performance across periods and against other companies in the industry, and is an indication of the Company s ability to generate cash to finance capital investment programs, to service debt and to meet other financial obligations. This measure is used, along with other measures, in the calculation of certain performance targets for the Company s management and employees.

Debt to Capitalization and Debt to Adjusted Capitalization 
 Debt to Adjusted Capitalization is a non-GAAP measure which adjusts capitalization for historical ceiling test impairments that were recorded as at December 31, 2011. Management monitors Debt to Adjusted Capitalization as a proxy for the Company s financial covenant under the Credit Facilities which require Debt to Adjusted Capitalization to be less than 60 percent. Adjusted Capitalization includes debt, total shareholders equity and an equity adjustment for cumulative historical ceiling test impairments recorded as at December 31, 2011 in conjunction with the Company s January 1, 2012 adoption of U.S. GAAP.

Debt to EBITDA and Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 
 Debt to EBITDA and Debt to Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. EBITDA is defined as trailing 12-month net earnings (loss) before income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and interest. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for impairments, accretion of asset retirement obligation, unrealized gains/losses on risk management, foreign exchange gains/losses, gains/losses on divestitures and other gains/losses. 
 Management believes these measures are useful to the Company and its investors as a measure of financial leverage and the Company s ability to service its debt and other financial obligations. These measures are used, along with other measures, in the calculation of certain financial performance targets for the Company s management and employees.

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about Ovintiv s potential exposure to market risks. The term market risk refers to the Company s risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, NGL and natural gas prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking information provides indicators of how the Company views and manages ongoing market risk exposures. 
 COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
 Commodity price risk arises from the effect fluctuations in future commodity prices, including oil, NGLs and natural gas, may have on future revenues, expenses and cash flows. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for oil and spot market prices applicable to the Company s natural gas production. Pricing for oil, NGLs and natural gas production is volatile and unpredictable as discussed in Part 1, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q in the Executive Overview section in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10 K. To partially mitigate exposure to commodity price risk, the Company may enter into various derivative financial instruments including futures, forwards, swaps, options and costless collars. The use of these derivative instruments is governed under formal policies and is subject to limits established by the Board of Directors and may vary from time to time. Both exchange traded and over-the-counter traded derivative instruments may be subject to margin-deposit requirements, and the Company may be required from time to time to deposit cash or provide letters of credit with exchange brokers or counterparties to satisfy these margin requirements. For additional information relating to the Company s derivative and financial instruments, see Note 19 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. 
 The table below summarizes the sensitivity of the fair value of the Company s risk management positions to fluctuations in commodity prices, with all other variables held constant. The Company has used a 10 percent variability to assess the potential impact of commodity price changes. Fluctuations in commodity prices could have resulted in unrealized gains (losses) impacting pre-tax net earnings as follows:

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK 
 Foreign exchange risk arises from changes in foreign exchange rates that may affect the fair value or future cash flows from the Company s financial assets or liabilities. As Ovintiv operates primarily in the United States and Canada, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars can have a significant effect on the Company s reported results. 
 The table below summarizes selected foreign exchange impacts on Ovintiv s financial results when compared to the same periods in 2023.

Foreign exchange gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated and settled, and primarily include: 
 U.S. dollar denominated financing debt issued from Canada 

U.S. dollar denominated risk management assets and liabilities held in Canada 

U.S. dollar denominated cash and short-term investments held in Canada 

Foreign denominated intercompany loans 

To partially mitigate the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations on future commodity revenues and expenses, the Company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts. As at September 30, 2024, Ovintiv has entered into 118 million notional U.S. dollar denominated currency swaps at an average exchange rate of C 1.3697 to US 1, which mature monthly through the remainder of 2024, and 25 million notional U.S. dollar denominated currency swaps at an average exchange rate of C 1.3800 to US 1, which mature monthly throughout the first half of 2025. 
 As at September 30, 2024, Ovintiv did not have any U.S. dollar denominated financing debt issued from Canada that was subject to foreign exchange exposure. 
 The table below summarizes the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, with all other variables held constant. The Company has used a 10 percent variability to assess the potential impact from Canadian to U.S. foreign currency exchange rate changes. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have resulted in unrealized gains (losses) impacting pre-tax net earnings as follows: 

September 30, 2024 

(US millions) 
 
 10 Rate Increase 

10 Rate Decrease 

Foreign currency exchange 

126 

(153) 

INTEREST RATE RISK 
 Interest rate risk arises from changes in market interest rates that may affect the fair value or future cash flows from the Company s financial assets or liabilities. The Company may partially mitigate its exposure to interest rate changes by holding a mix of both fixed and floating rate debt and may also enter into interest rate derivatives to partially mitigate effects of fluctuations in market interest rates. 
 As at September 30, 2024, Ovintiv had floating rate revolving credit and term loan borrowings of 424 million. Accordingly, on a before-tax basis, the sensitivity for each one percent change in interest rates on floating rate revolving credit and term loan borrowings was 4 million. 
 59 

Item 4: Controls and Procedures 
 
 DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Ovintiv s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equit y Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities 
 
 On September 26, 2023, the Company announced it had received regulatory approval to purchase, for cancellation or return to treasury, up to approximately 26.7 million shares of common stock pursuant to a NCIB over a 12-month period from October 3, 2023 to October 2, 2024. The number of shares of common stock authorized for purchase represented approximately 10 percent of Ovintiv s issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of such time. 
 On September 26, 2024, the TSX accepted the Company s notice of intention to renew its NCIB to purchase up to approximately 25.9 million shares of common stock, during the 12-month period commencing October 3, 2024 and ending October 2, 2025. The number of shares authorized for purchase represents 10 percent of Ovintiv s public float (as defined in the TSX Company Manual) as of September 20, 2024, which equals approximately 10 percent of Ovintiv s issued and outstanding shares of common stock as at such time. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased approximately 3.7 million shares of common stock for approximately 162 million, excluding excise tax, at a weighted average price of 43.43. The following table presents the common shares purchased during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

the normal course through the facilities of the TSX; and (iii) the Other Published Markets Exemption does not exceed, over the 12-month period of its current NCIB, 10 percent of Ovintiv s public float. As a result, the NCIB Exemption effectively allows Ovintiv to purchase up to 10 percent of its public float on U.S. Markets under its NCIB. Without the NCIB Exemption this amount would be limited to 5 percent of Ovintiv s outstanding common stock within a 12-month period under applicable Canadian securities law.
