In accordance with FASB ASC 320-10-55-24, the transfer from AFS to HTM must be recorded at the fair value of the AFS securities at the time of transfer. The net unrealized holding loss of million, net of tax, at the date of transfer was retained in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), with the associated pre-tax amount retained in the carrying value of the HTM securities. Such amounts will be amortized to comprehensive income over the remaining life of the securities.

 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, management performed an assessment for possible impairment related to credit losses of the Corporation s debt securities, relying on information obtained from various sources, including publicly available financial data, ratings by external agencies, brokers and other sources. Based on the results of the assessment, management believes there is credit related impairment of these debt securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 For the securities that comprise corporate notes and bonds and the securities that are issued by state and political subdivisions, management monitors publicly available financial information, such as filings with the SEC, in order to evaluate the securities for potential credit impairment. For financial institution issuers, management monitors information from quarterly "call" report filings that are used to generate Uniform Bank Performance Reports. All other securities that were in an unrealized loss position at the balance sheet date were reviewed by management, and issuer-specific documents were reviewed as appropriate given the following considerations; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than cost, and whether management does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, management concluded the debt securities described in the previous paragraphs were not impaired for reasons due to credit quality for the following reasons: 
 
 There is no indication of any significant deterioration of the creditworthiness of the institutions that issued the securities. 
 All contractual interest payments on the securities have been received as scheduled, and no information has come to management s attention through the processes previously described which would lead to a conclusion that future contractual payments will not be timely received. 
 The unrealized losses were deemed to be temporary changes in value related to market movements in interest yields. 
 
 The Corporation does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis.

million and thousand, respectively. This increase was primarily driven by growth in the Corporation's loan portfolio in new market areas as well as an increased unemployment rate forecast, partially offset by improvements in the Corporation's historical loss rates, annual updates to the Corporation's loss drivers and assumptions, as well as the impact of net charge-offs. Significant uncertainty persists regarding the domestic and global economy due to persistent inflation in certain segments of the U.S. economy, continued elevated interest rates, fluctuating levels of consumer confidence, and geopolitical conflicts. Management will continue to proactively evaluate its estimate of expected credit losses as new information becomes available.

 Loan Modifications 
 
 The Corporation adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures effective January 1, 2023. The amendments in ASU 2022-02 eliminated the recognition and measure of troubled debt restructurings and enhanced disclosures for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 
 
 Occasionally, the Corporation modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, an other-than-insignificant payment delay or interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 In some cases, the Corporation provides multiple types of concessions on one loan. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. For the loans included in the "combination" columns below, multiple types of modifications have been made on the same loan within the current reporting period. The combination is at least two of the following: a term extension, principal forgiveness, an other-than-insignificant payment delay and/or an interest rate reduction.

 If the Corporation determines that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off and the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. 
 
 Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 The Corporation categorizes loans receivable into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Corporation analyzes loans individually to classify the loans as to credit risk. 
 
 The Corporation uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 
 Special Mention: A loan classified as special mention has a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Corporation s credit position at some future date.

 Subordinated Debentures 
 
 In 2007, the Corporation issued million floating rate trust preferred securities as part of a pooled offering of such securities. The interest rate on each offering was determined quarterly and floated based upon three-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus . Effective September 15, 2023, the interest rate calculation method was revised. The interest rate is now determined quarterly, and floats based on the three-month SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of plus . This change reflects the transition from LIBOR to SOFR as the reference rate. The all-in rate was at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. The Corporation issued subordinated debentures to the trusts in exchange for the proceeds of the offerings, which debentures represent the sole assets of the trusts. The subordinated debentures must be redeemed no later than 2037. The Corporation may redeem the debentures, in whole or in part, at face value at any time. The Corporation has the option to defer interest payments from time to time for a period not to exceed five consecutive years. Although the trusts are variable interest entities, the Corporation is not the primary beneficiary. As a result, because the trusts are not consolidated with the Corporation, the Corporation does not report the securities issued by the trusts as liabilities. Instead, the Corporation reports as liabilities the subordinated debentures issued by the Corporation and held by the trusts, since the liabilities are not eliminated in consolidation. The trust preferred securities were designated to qualify as Tier 1 capital under the Federal Reserve s capital guidelines. 
 
 Subordinated Notes 
 
 In June 2021, the Corporation sold million aggregate principal amount of its fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes to eligible purchasers in a private offering in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the provisions of Rule 506 of Regulation D thereunder. The notes will mature in June 2031, and initially bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears, to, but excluding, June 15, 2026, and thereafter to, but excluding, the maturity date or earlier redemption, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month average SOFR plus . The net proceeds from the sale were approximately million, after deducting offering expenses. These subordinated notes were designed to qualify as Tier 2 capital under the Federal Reserve s capital guidelines and were given an investment grade rating of BBB- by Kroll Bond Rating Agency. The unamortized debt issuance costs were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Unused lines of credit Standby letters of credit 
 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Corporation evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Corporation upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral that is held varies but may include securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and residential and income-producing commercial properties. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Loan Commitments 
 
 The Corporation maintains an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans receivable, modified to take into account the probability of a draw-down on the commitment. The provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is included in the provision for credit losses on the Corporation's condensed consolidated statements of income. The allowance for unfunded commitments is included in other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Note 4, "Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses," in the condensed consolidated financial statements provides more detail concerning the provision for credit losses related to the loan portfolio of the Corporation.

 Derivatives on Behalf of Customers 
 
 The Corporation entered into certain interest rate swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivative contracts relate to transactions in which the Corporation enters into an interest rate swap with a customer while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with another financial institution. In connection with each swap transaction, the Corporation agrees to pay interest to the customer on a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the customer on a similar notional amount at a fixed interest rate. Concurrently, the Corporation agrees to pay another financial institution the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount. The transaction allows the Corporation s customers to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate. Because the Corporation acts as an intermediary for its customer, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts offset each other and do not impact the Corporation s results of operations. 
 
 The Corporation pledged cash collateral to another financial institution with a balance of million as of September 30, 2024 and thousand as of December 31, 2023. This balance is included in cash and cash equivalents due from banks on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation may require its customers to post cash or securities as collateral on its program of back-to-back swaps depending upon the specific facts and circumstances surrounding each loan and individual swap. In addition, certain language is included in the International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreement and loan documents where, in default situations, the Corporation is permitted to access collateral supporting the loan relationship to recover any losses suffered on the derivative asset or liability. The Corporation may be required to post additional collateral to swap counterparties in the future in proportion to potential increases in unrealized loss positions. Effective on September 30, 2023 the Corporation amended all of the back-to-back swap contracts to reference the 1-month SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of basis points "Fallback SOFR."

 Risk Participation Agreements 
 
 The Corporation s existing credit derivatives result from participation in or out of interest rate swaps provided by or to external lenders as part of loan participation arrangements, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Corporation s assets or liabilities. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Corporation provides to certain lenders which participate in loans. 
 
 The Corporation entered into Risk Participation Agreement ("RPA") swaps with other financial institutions related to loans in which the Corporation is a participant in. The RPA provides credit protection to the financial institution should the borrower fail to perform on its interest rate derivative contract with the financial institution. The notional amount of this contingent agreement is million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Corporation entered into RPA swaps with other financial institutions related to loans in which the Corporation is a participant out.

 A loan is considered to be a collateral dependent loan when, based on current information and events, the Corporation expects repayment of the financial assets to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the Corporation has determined that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty as of the measurement date. The allowance for credit losses is measured by estimating the fair value of the loan based on the present value of expected cash flows, the market price of the loan, or the underlying fair value of the loan s collateral. For real estate loans, fair value of the loan s collateral is determined by third-party appraisals, which are then adjusted for the estimated selling and closing costs related to liquidation of the collateral. For this asset class, the actual valuation methods (income, sales comparable, or cost) vary based on the status of the project or property. For example, land is generally based on the sales comparable method while construction is based on the income and/or sales comparable methods. The unobservable inputs may vary depending on the individual assets with no one of the three methods being the predominant approach. The Corporation reviews the third-party appraisal for appropriateness and may adjust the value downward to consider selling and closing costs. For non-real estate loans, fair value of the loan s collateral may be determined using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business.

 While estimates of fair value are based on management s judgment of the most appropriate factors as of the balance sheet dates, there is no assurance that the estimated fair values would have been realized if the assets had been disposed of or the liabilities settled at that date, since market values may differ depending on various circumstances. The estimated fair values would also not apply to subsequent dates. The fair value of other equity interests is based on the net asset values provided by the underlying investment partnership. ASU 2015-7 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient and related disclosures. In addition, other assets and liabilities that are not financial instruments, such as premises and equipment, are not included in the disclosures. 
 
 Also, non-financial assets such as, among other things, the estimated earnings power of core deposits, the earnings potential of trust accounts, the trained workforce, and customer goodwill, which typically are not recognized on the balance sheet, may have value but are not included in the fair value disclosures.

GENERAL OVERVIEW 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Corporation is presented to provide insight into management s assessment of financial results. The terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to CNB Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries. The financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries are not necessarily indicative of future performance. 
 
 The Corporation s subsidiary, CNB Bank, provides financial services to individuals and businesses. The Bank franchise's primary market areas are the Pennsylvania counties of Blair, Cambria, Centre, Clearfield, Elk, Indiana, Jefferson, and McKean. ERIEBANK, a division of the Bank, operates in the Pennsylvania counties of Crawford, Erie, and Warren and in the Ohio counties of Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, and Lorain. FCBank, a division of the Bank, operates in the Ohio counties of Crawford, Delaware, Franklin, Knox, Marion, Morrow, and Richland. BankOnBuffalo, a division of the Bank, operates in the New York counties of Erie and Niagara. Ridge View Bank, a division of the Bank, operates in the Virginia counties of Botetourt, Craig, Franklin, New River Valley, and Roanoke. Impressia Bank, a division of the Bank, operates in the Bank s primary market areas. Although the Corporation s strategies, through the Bank, are executed based on the divisions discussed above, the Bank is a single Pennsylvania-chartered bank whereby all divisions of the Bank conduct their business on a doing business as basis. 
 
 In addition to the Bank, the Corporation has four other subsidiaries. CNB Securities Corporation is incorporated in Delaware and currently maintains investments in debt and equity securities. CNB Insurance Agency, incorporated in Pennsylvania, provides for the sale of nonproprietary annuities and other insurance products. CNB Risk Management, Inc., incorporated in Delaware, is a captive insurance company that insures against certain risks unique to the operations of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today's insurance marketplace. Holiday Financial Services Corporation, incorporated in Pennsylvania, offers small balance unsecured loans and secured loans, primarily collateralized by automobiles and equipment, to borrowers with higher risk characteristics. 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Corporation s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, included the 2023 Form 10-K, and in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 1 of this report. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year ending December 31, 2024, or any future period. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 
 This report contains references to financial measures that are not defined in GAAP. Management uses non-GAAP financial information in its analysis of the Corporation s performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results of operations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods presented. The Corporation s management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP measures to analyze the Corporation s financial performance without the impact of unusual items or events that may obscure trends in the Corporation s underlying performance. This non-GAAP data should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. 
 
 Non-GAAP measures reflected within the discussion below include: 
 
 Tangible book value per share; 
 Tangible common equity/tangible assets; 
 Net interest margin (fully tax-equivalent basis); 
 Efficiency ratio; 
 Pre-provision net revenue ("PPNR"); and 
 Return on average tangible common equity 
 
 A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided below in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section.

 PRIMARY FACTORS USED TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE 
 
 Management considers return on average assets, return on average equity, return on average tangible common equity, earnings per common share, tangible book value per common share, asset quality, net interest margin, and other metrics as key measures of the financial performance of the Corporation. The interest rate environment will continue to play an important role in the future earnings of the Corporation. To address the challenging interest rate and competitive environments, the Corporation continues to evaluate, develop and implement strategies necessary to support its ongoing financial performance objectives and future growth goals. Additionally, management frequently evaluates the potential impact of economic and geopolitical events that may have an impact on the credit risk profile of its customers and develops proactive strategies to mitigate such potential impacts on the Corporation s loan portfolio. 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents totaled 360.9 million at September 30, 2024, including additional excess liquidity of 282.0 million held at the Federal Reserve, compared to 222.0 million at December 31, 2023. These excess funds, when combined with collective contingent liquidity resources of 4.5 billion including (i) available borrowing capacity from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve, and (ii) available unused commitments from brokered deposit sources and other third-party funding channels, including previously established lines of credit from correspondent banks, result in the total on-hand and contingent liquidity sources for the Corporation to be approximately 5.0 times the estimated amount of adjusted uninsured deposit balances. 
 
 Management believes the liquidity needs of the Corporation are satisfied primarily by the current balance of cash and cash equivalents, customer and brokered deposits, FHLB financing, the portions of the securities and loan portfolios that mature within one year, and other third-party funding channels. The Corporation expects that these sources of funds will enable it to meet cash obligations and off-balance sheet commitments as they come due. In addition to the above noted liquidity sources, the Corporation maintains access to the Federal Reserve discount window. 

SECURITIES 
 
 AFS debt securities and equity securities combined totaled 389.4 million and 351.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the total balance of investments classified as HTM debt securities was 328.2 million compared to 389.0 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Corporation s objective is to maintain the investment securities portfolio at an appropriate level to balance the earnings and liquidity provided by the portfolio. Note 3, "Securities," to the condensed consolidated financial statements provides more detail concerning the composition of the Corporation s securities portfolio and the process for evaluating securities for impairment. 
 
 The following table summarizes the maturity distribution schedule with corresponding weighted-average yields of AFS debt securities as of September 30, 2024. Weighted-average yields have been computed on a fully taxable-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21 . Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date.

 The portfolio contains no holdings of a single issuer that exceeds 10 of shareholders equity other than U.S. government sponsored entities. 
 
 The Corporation generally purchases debt securities over time and does not attempt to "time" its transactions, which allows for more efficient management of fluctuations in the interest rate environment. The Corporation's strategy given the current environment is to focus on lower risk securities and shorter durations that complement the current portfolio investment ladder, coupled with consistent reinvestment of cash flows to replace lower earning assets. 
 
 The Corporation monitors the earnings performance and the effectiveness of the liquidity of the securities portfolio on a regular basis through meetings of the Asset/Liability Committee ("ALCO"). The ALCO also reviews and manages interest rate risk for the Corporation. Through active balance sheet management and analysis of the securities portfolio, a sufficient level of liquidity is maintained to satisfy depositor requirements and various credit needs of our customers. 

LOANS RECEIVABLE 
 
 Note 4, "Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses," to the condensed consolidated financial statements provides more detail concerning the loan portfolio of the Corporation. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, loans, excluding the impact of syndicated loans, totaled 4.5 billion, representing an increase of 162.7 million, or 3.73 year to date increase (4.98 annualized), from December 31, 2023. The increase in loans was primarily driven by qualitative growth in commercial real estate coupled with growth in commercial and industrial and residential real estate in the Columbus, Erie and Roanoke markets and continued new relationship growth in the Corporation's recent expansion market of Cleveland, and growth in the Corporation's Private Banking division with notable activity in the Roanoke market.

Table of Contents 

 At September 30, 2024, the Corporation's condensed consolidated balance sheet reflected a decrease in syndicated lending balances of 39.2 million compared to December 31, 2023, primarily resulting from scheduled paydowns or early payoffs of certain syndicated loans. The syndicated loan portfolio totaled 69.5 million, or 1.51 of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to 108.7 million, or 2.43 of total loans at December 31, 2023. The Corporation is closely managing the level of its syndicated loan portfolio while it focuses more resources on organic loan growth from its in-market customer relationships. 
 
 Loan Origination/Risk Management 
 
 The Corporation has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and nonperforming, and potential problem loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. The Corporation has not underwritten any hybrid loans, payment option loans, or low documentation/no documentation loans. Variable rate loans are generally underwritten at the fully indexed rate. Loan underwriting policies and procedures have not changed materially between any periods presented. As discussed more fully above, syndicated loan purchases are underwritten utilizing the same process as the Corporation s originated loans. 
 
 The Corporation continues to explore the credit and reputational risks associated with climate change and their potential impact on the foregoing, while closely monitoring regulatory developments on climate risk. This includes, among other things, researching and developing a formalized approach to considering climate change related risks in the Corporation's underwriting processes. This approach will be impacted, in part, by the accessibility and reliability of both customer climate risk data and climate risk data in general. One of the objectives of these efforts is to enable the Corporation to better understand the climate change related risks associated with the Corporation's customers' business activities and to be able to monitor their response to those risks and their ultimate impact on the Corporation's customers. 
 
 Loan Portfolio Profile 
 
 As part of its lending policy and risk management activities, the Corporation tracks lending exposure by industry classification and type to determine potential risks associated with industry concentrations, and whether any risk issues could lead to additional credit loss exposure. In the current post-pandemic and inflationary economic environment, the Corporation has evaluated its exposure to the office, hospitality, and multifamily industries within its commercial real estate portfolio. Even given the Corporation s historically sound underwriting protocols and high credit quality ratings for borrowers in these industries, the Corporation monitors numerous relevant sensitivity elements at both underwriting and through and beyond the funding period, including projects occupancy, loan-to-value, absorption and cap rates, debt service coverage and covenant compliance, and developer/lessor financial strength both in the project and globally. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation had the following key metrics related to its office, hospitality and multifamily portfolios: 
 
 Commercial office loans 
 There were 114 outstanding loans, totaling 117.0 million, or 2.55 of the Corporation loans outstanding; 
 There were no nonaccrual commercial office loans at September 30, 2024; 
 There was one past due commercial office loan that totaled 214 thousand, or 0.18 of total commercial office loans outstanding at September 30, 2024; and 
 The average outstanding balance per commercial office loan was 1.0 million. 
 
 Commercial hospitality loans 
 There were 173 outstanding loans, totaling 320.6 million, or 6.98 of total Corporation loans outstanding; 
 There were no nonaccrual commercial hospitality loans at September 30, 2024; 
 There were no past due commercial hospitality loans at September 30,2024; and 
 The average outstanding balance per commercial hospitality loan was 1.9 million. 
 
 Commercial multifamily loans 
 There were 225 outstanding loans, totaling 349.1 million, or 7.60 of total Corporation loans outstanding; 
 There was one nonaccrual commercial multifamily loan that totaled 268 thousand, or 0.08 of total multifamily loans outstanding. The one customer relationship did not have a related specific loss reserve at September 30, 2024; 
 There were two past due commercial multifamily loans that totaled 760 thousand, or 0.22 of total commercial multifamily loans outstanding at September 30, 2024; and 
 The average outstanding balance per commercial multifamily loan was 1.6 million.

 At September 30, 2024, no industry concentration existed which exceeded 10 of the total loan portfolio. 
 
 Loans Receivable Credit Quality 
 
 The following table presents information concerning the loan portfolio delinquency and other nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Nonaccrual loans 39,855 29,639 Accrual loans greater than 90 days past due 666 55 Total nonperforming loans 40,521 29,694 Other real estate owned 1,514 2,111 Total nonperforming assets 42,035 31,805 Total loans receivable 4,591,908 4,468,476 Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans receivable 0.87 0.66 Total assets 6,014,844 5,752,957 Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets 0.70 0.55 Allowance for credit losses on loans receivable 46,644 45,832 Allowance for credit losses / Total loans 1.02 1.03 Ratio of allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 117.03 154.63 
 
 Total nonperforming assets were 42.0 million, or 0.70 of total assets, as of September 30, 2024, compared to 31.8 million, or 0.55 of total assets, as of December 31, 2023. In addition, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 117.03 at September 30, 2024, compared to 154.63 at December 31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming assets was primarily due to two relationships. The first relationship was an owner-occupied commercial real estate relationship totaling 4.6 million with a specific reserve balance of 1.2 million and the second was a commercial relationship (consisting of various loan types) totaling 7.9 million with a specific reserve of 2.2 million. Management does not believe there is risk of significant additional loss exposures beyond the specific reserves related to these loan relationships. 
 
 The Corporation has established written lending policies and procedures that require underwriting standards, loan documentation, and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding a loan. Subsequent to the funding of a loan, ongoing review of credits is required. Credit reviews are performed quarterly by an outsourced loan review firm and cover approximately 65 of the commercial loan portfolio on an annual basis. In addition, the external independent loan review firm reviews past due loans and all significant classified assets and nonaccrual loans annually. 
 
 Potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of a borrower to continue to comply with contractual repayment terms because of the borrower s potential operating or financial difficulties. Management monitors these "watchlist" loans monthly to determine potential losses within the commercial loan portfolio. The "watchlist" is comprised of all credits risk rated special mention, substandard and doubtful.

 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
 
 The amount of each allowance for credit losses account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant internal and external factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the Corporation's allowance for credit losses account is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the Corporation's control, including the performance of the Corporation's loan portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates, and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is subject to a formal analysis by the Credit Administration and Finance Departments of the Corporation. For additional information regarding the Corporation's accounting policies related to credit losses, refer to Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K and Note 4, "Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses" to these condensed consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. 
 
 The tables below provide an allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans receivable by loan portfolio segment at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023; however, allocation of a portion of the allowance for credit losses to one segment does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other segments.

 (1) As previously disclosed in the Corporation s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, revisions were made to the amount of allowance allocated and total loans receivable columns disclosure as of December 31, 2023 to reflect the revisions for the applicable portfolio segments. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses measured as a percentage of total loans receivable was 1.02 as of September 30, 2024 and 1.03 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Corporation's allowance for credit losses is influenced by loan volumes, risk rating migration, delinquency status and other internal and external conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions and other external factors. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses increased 812 thousand. This increase was primarily driven by growth in the Corporation's loan portfolio in new market areas as well as an increased unemployment rate forecast, partially offset by improvements in the Corporation's historical loss rates, annual updates to the Corporation's loss drivers and assumptions, as well as the impact of net charge-offs. Significant uncertainty persists regarding the domestic and global economy due to persistent inflation in certain segments of the U.S. economy, continued elevated interest rates, fluctuating levels of consumer confidence, and geopolitical conflicts. Management will continue to proactively evaluate its estimate of expected credit losses as new information becomes available. 
 
 Note 4, "Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses," to the condensed consolidated financial statements provides further disclosure of loan balances by portfolio segment as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

DEPOSITS 
 
 The Corporation s sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, amortization and repayment of loan principal, interest earned on or maturation of investment securities, and funds provided from operations. The Corporation considers deposits to be its primary source of funding in support of growth in assets.

 At September 30, 2024, total deposits were 5.2 billion, reflecting an increase of 218.2 million, or 4.37 , from December 31, 2023. The increase in deposit balances was primarily attributable to an increase in noninterest-bearing business deposits and retail saving deposits. In addition, the total number of deposit households increased by approximately 1.85 from December 31, 2023.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity measures an organization s ability to meet its cash obligations as they come due. The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities. The ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure, its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds. 
 
 The Corporation s expected material cash requirements for the twelve months ended September 30, 2025 and thereafter consist of withdrawals by depositors, credit commitments to borrowers, shareholder dividends, share repurchases, operating expenses, and capital expenditures that are pursuant to the Corporation's strategic initiatives. The Corporation expects to satisfy these short-term and long-term cash requirements through deposit growth, principal and interest payments from loans and investment securities, maturing loans and investment securities, as well as by maintaining access to wholesale funding sources. 
 
 The objective of the Corporation's liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund the Corporation's operations and to meet cash obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. The Corporation seeks to achieve this objective and ensure that funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid funds through asset/liability management, which includes managing the mix and time to maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities on its balance sheet. The Corporation's liquidity position is enhanced by its ability to raise additional funds as needed in the wholesale markets. 
 
 Asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in banks, including the Federal Reserve, and AFS debt securities. Liability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which include core deposits, correspondent banks and other wholesale funding sources. 
 
 The Corporation's liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Liquidity risk management is an important element in the Corporation's asset/liability management process. The Corporation regularly models liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or potential funding shortfalls resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management. These scenarios are incorporated into the Corporation's contingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of its liquidity needs.

Table of Contents 

At September 30, 2024, the Corporation s cash and cash equivalents position was approximately 361.0 million, including liquidity of 282.0 million held at the Federal Reserve. These excess funds, when combined with 4.5 billion in (i) available borrowing capacity from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve, and (ii) available unused commitments from brokered deposit sources and other third-party funding channels, including previously established lines of credit from correspondent banks, result in the total on-hand and contingent liquidity sources for the Corporation to be approximately 5.0 times the estimated amount of adjusted uninsured deposit balances discussed above.

 As of September 30, 2024, management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's liquidity, capital resources or operations. In addition, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity that would have a material adverse effect on the Corporation. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation has entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to make future payments. Refer to the accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for the expected timing of such payments as of September 30, 2024. The Corporation s material contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 consist of (i) long-term borrowings - Note 7, "Borrowings," (ii) operating leases - Note 5, "Leases," (iii) time deposits with stated maturity dates - Note 6, "Deposits," and (iv) commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit - Note 9, "Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Contingencies." 
 
 Shareholders Equity, Capital Ratios and Metrics 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation s total shareholders equity was 606.4 million, representing an increase of 35.1 million, or 6.15 , from December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the Corporation's retained earnings (net income, partially offset by the common and preferred dividends paid). 
 
 The Corporation has complied with the standards of capital adequacy mandated by government regulations. Bank regulators have established "risk-based" capital requirements designed to measure capital adequacy. Risk-based capital ratios reflect the relative risks of various assets banks hold in their portfolios. A weight category (0 for the lowest risk assets and increasing for each tier of higher risk assets) is assigned to each asset on the balance sheet.

 As of September 30, 2024 all of the Corporation's capital ratios exceeded regulatory "well-capitalized" levels. The Corporation's capital ratios and book value per common share at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows: 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Total risk-based ratio 16.06 15.99 Tier 1 risk-based ratio 13.30 13.20 Common equity tier 1 ratio 11.64 11.49 Tier 1 leverage ratio 10.59 10.54 Common shareholders' equity/total assets 9.12 8.93 Tangible common equity/tangible assets (1) 
 8.45 8.22 Book value per common share 26.13 24.57 Tangible book value per common share (1) 
 24.03 22.46 
 (1) Tangible common equity, tangible assets and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures calculated using GAAP amounts. Tangible common equity is calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets and preferred equity from the calculation of shareholders equity. Tangible assets is calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of total assets. Tangible book value per common share is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by the number of shares outstanding. The Corporation believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors that is useful in understanding its financial condition. Because not all companies use the same calculation of tangible common equity and tangible assets, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures calculated by other companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section in Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Corporation's pre-tax net unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaled approximately 62.5 million, or 10.30 of total shareholders' equity, compared to 82.2 million, or 14.40 of total shareholders' equity at December 31, 2023. The change in unrealized losses was primarily due to changes in the yield curve during the first, second and third quarters of 2024 compared to 2023, relative to the Corporation's scheduled bond maturities. Importantly, all regulatory capital ratios for the Corporation would exceed regulatory "well-capitalized" levels as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 if the net unrealized losses at the respective dates were fully recognized. Additionally, the Corporation maintained 102.0 million of liquid funds at its holding company, which more than covers the 62.5 million in unrealized losses on investments held primarily in its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, as an immediately available source of contingent capital to be down-streamed to the Bank, if necessary.

 AVERAGE BALANCES, INTEREST RATES AND YIELDS 
 
 The loans receivable categories used to monitor and analyze interest income and yields are different than the portfolio segments used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans receivable. The allowance for credit losses was calculated by pooling loans of similar credit risk characteristics and credit monitoring procedures. See Note 4, "Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses," for more information about pooling of loans receivable for the allowance for credit losses.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

OVERVIEW 
 
 Net income available to common shareholders ("earnings") was 12.9 million, or 0.61 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Corporation s earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were 12.7 million, or 0.60 per diluted share. The increase in diluted earnings per share comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the increase in non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense. 
 
 Annualized return on average equity was 9.28 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.80 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Annualized return on average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, was 10.33 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.07 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The Corporation's efficiency ratio was 66.34 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 67.00 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The efficiency ratio on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP ratio, was 65.58 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 66.26 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

NET INTEREST INCOME 
 
 Net interest income was 47.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 47.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. When comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023, the increase in net interest income of 250 thousand, or 0.53 , was primarily due to an increase in the Corporation's interest income as a result of the increase in total loans outstanding quarter over quarter, partially offset by targeted interest-bearing deposit rate increases to ensure both deposit relationship retention and new deposit growth in the Corporation's markets. 
 
 Net interest margin was 3.43 and 3.55 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, was 3.42 and 3.53 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The yield on earning assets of 5.98 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 35 basis points from September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the net benefit of higher interest rates on both variable-rate loans and new loan production. 

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
 
 The provision for credit losses was 2.4 million and 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Management believes the charges to the provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were appropriate and the allowance for credit losses was adequate to absorb current expected credit losses in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024. 

NON-INTEREST INCOME 
 
 Total non-interest income was 11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to higher pass-through income from small business investment companies and net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities. 

NON-INTEREST EXPENSE 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total non-interest expense was 38.8 million, compared to 36.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase from the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of higher salaries and benefits driven by costs for personnel added for new offices in expansion markets, an increase in personnel costs related to annual merit increases, increases in health insurance costs, and contractual renewal increases in the Corporation's investments in technology applications. In addition, card processing and interchange expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 1.2 million, or 53.24 of card processing and interchange income, compared to 1.2 million, or 57.53 of card processing and interchange income for the third quarter of 2023.

 INCOME TAX EXPENSE 
 
 Income tax expense was 3.3 million, representing a 19.31 effective tax rate, compared to 3.4 million, representing a 19.86 effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 Earnings were 36.3 million, or 1.72 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to earnings of 40.8 million, or 1.94 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As previously noted, the decrease in diluted earnings per share comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the rise in deposit costs year over year. 
 
 Annualized return on average equity was 9.01 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.74 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Annualized return on average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, was 10.01 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.23 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The Corporation's efficiency ratio was 67.10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 64.26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The efficiency ratio on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP ratio, was 66.34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 63.60 the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

NET INTEREST INCOME 
 
 Net interest income was 138.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 142.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 3.7 million, or 2.61 , was due to loan growth and the benefits of the impact of higher interest rates resulting in greater income on variable-rate loans, coupled with a higher average balance of interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve, being more than offset by an increase in the Corporation's interest expense as a result of targeted interest-bearing deposit rate increases to ensure both deposit growth and retention. 
 
 Net interest margin was 3.40 and 3.66 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, was 3.38 and 3.64 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The yield on earning assets of 5.89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 41 basis points from September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the net benefit of higher interest rates on both variable-rate loans and new loan production. 

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
 
 The provision for credit losses was 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.5 million increase in the provision expense for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of the increased net loan charge-offs and higher loan growth. 
 
 Management believes the charges to the provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were appropriate and the allowance for credit losses was adequate to absorb current expected credit losses in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024. 

NON-INTEREST INCOME 
 
 Total non-interest income was 28.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher pass-through income from SBICs coupled with an increase in net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities.

 NON-INTEREST EXPENSE 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total non-interest expense was 112.2 million, compared to 106.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 5.3 million, or 4.96 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of an increase in salaries and benefits and technology expenses, partially offset by a decrease in card processing and interchange expenses. In addition, other non-interest expenses increased primarily due to an increase in personnel costs related to annual merit increases and growth in the Corporation's staff and new offices in its expansion markets, while the increase in technology was primarily due to year-over-year investments in technology applications aimed at enhancing both customer online banking capabilities, customer call center communications, and in-branch technology delivery channels. The decrease in card processing and interchange expenses related to the changes made by the Corporation to its cardholder rewards program. 

INCOME TAX EXPENSE 
 
 Income tax expense was 9.2 million, representing an 18.92 effective tax rate, compared to 10.6 million, representing a 19.47 effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation enters into these transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For further information, see Note 9, "Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Contingencies," to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 The Corporation s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the financial services industry. Accounting and reporting practices for the allowance for credit losses and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations, including the associated goodwill and intangibles that was recorded, required the use of material estimates. Application of assumptions different than those used by management could result in material changes in the Corporation s financial position or results of operations. Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 3, "Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses" of the 2023 Form 10-K provide additional detail with regard to the Corporation s accounting for the allowance for credit losses and loans receivable. There have been no other significant changes in the application of accounting policies since December 31, 2023.

 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by Item 1A. Risk Factors and the section captioned "Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that Could Affect Future Results" included in this report, and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report. 
 
 As a financial institution, the Corporation's primary source of market risk exposure is interest rate risk, which influences fluctuations in the Corporation's future earnings due to changes in interest rates. This risk is closely correlated to the repricing characteristics of the Corporation's portfolio of assets and liabilities, with each asset or liability repricing either at maturity or during the instrument's life cycle. 
 
 The Corporation s interest rate risk measurement philosophy focuses on maintaining an appropriate balance between the theoretical and the practical, especially given that the primary objective of the Corporation s overall asset/liability management process is to assess the level of interest rate risk in the Corporation s balance sheet. Therefore, the Corporation models a set of interest rate scenarios capturing the financial effects of a range of plausible rate scenarios. The collective impact of these scenarios is designed to enable the Corporation to understand the nature and extent of its sensitivity to interest rate changes. Doing so necessitates an assessment of rate changes over varying time horizons and of varying/sufficient degrees such that the impact of embedded options within the balance sheet are sufficiently examined. 
 
 The Corporation has designed its interest rate risk measurement activities to include the following core elements: (i) interest rate ramps and shocks, (ii) parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts, and (iii) a set of alternative rate scenarios, the nature of which change based upon prevailing market conditions. 
 
 The Corporation s primary tools in managing Interest Rate Risk ("IRR") are income simulation models. The income simulation models are utilized to quantify the potential impact of changing interest rates on earnings and to identify expected earnings trends given longer-term rate cycles. Standard gap reports are also utilized to provide supporting detailed information. 
 
 The Corporation also recognizes that a sustained environment of higher/lower interest rates will affect the underlying value of the Corporation s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments since the present value of their future cash flows (and the cash flows themselves) change when interest rates change. 
 
 IRR considerations include inherent assumptions and estimates, including the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, prepayments on amortizing assets, non-maturing deposit sensitivity, and loan and deposit pricing. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of rate changes, market conditions, and management strategies. 
 
 The following table demonstrates the annualized result of an interest rate simulation and the estimated effect that a parallel interest rate shift, or "shock," in the yield curve and subjective adjustments in deposit pricing might have on the Corporation s projected net interest income over the next 12 months. This simulation assumes that there is no growth in interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities over the next 12 months. The changes to net interest income shown below are in compliance with the Corporation s policy guidelines. 
 
 Change in Net Interest Income September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 +300 basis points (0.1) 2.6 +200 basis points 0.3 3.8 +100 basis points 0.3 4.6 -100 basis points (0.6) (3.8) -200 basis points (0.6) (6.5) -300 basis points (1.4) (12.8) 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Corporation has approximately 2.3 billion in outstanding loans receivable balances that are rate sensitive balances over the next twelve months.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 The Corporation s management, under the supervision of and with the participation of the Corporation s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has carried out an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that all material information required to be disclosed in reports the Corporation files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 
 
 There was no significant change in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 O THER I NFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 There are no pending legal proceedings to which the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or of which any of their properties is the subject, except ordinary routine proceedings which are incidental to the business. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 The following table provides information with respect to any purchase of shares of the Corporation s common stock made by or on behalf of the Corporation for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Common Share (2) 
 Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) 
 July 1 31, 2024 500,000 August 1 31, 2024 500,000 September 1 30, 2024 500,000 Total 500,000 
 (1) On June 12, 2024, the Corporation received acknowledgement from the Federal Reserve of the Corporation s 2024 Common Share Repurchase Program (the "2024 Plan"). The Corporation s Board of Directors previously approved the 2024 Plan, subject to the Federal Reserve Bank's response, authorizing the repurchase from time to time by the Corporation of up to 500,000 shares of the Corporation s common stock, provided that the aggregate purchase price of shares of common stock repurchased does not exceed 15,000,000. Pursuant to the 2024 Plan, repurchase of common stock, if any, are authorized to be made during the period beginning on June 12, 2024 (the date on which the Corporation received acknowledgement from the Federal Reserve Bank) through and including May 14, 2025, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as will comply with the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, subject to compliance with any material agreement to which the Corporation is a party. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended without prior notice. As of September 30, 2024, there were 500,000 shares remaining for repurchase under the 2024 Plan. 
 (2) The aggregate purchase price and weighted average price per share does not include the effect of excise tax expense incurred on net stock repurchases. 
 
 Additionally, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, certain employees surrendered shares of common stock owned by them to satisfy their statutory minimum U.S. federal and state tax obligations associated with the vesting of shares of restricted common stock issued under the CNB Financial Corporation 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
 
 Dividend Restrictions 
 
 The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Declaration and payment of cash dividends by the Corporation depends upon cash dividend payments to the Corporation by the Bank, which is our primary source of revenue and cash flow. 
 
 As a Pennsylvania state-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment and amounts of dividends under the Pennsylvania Banking Code. Further, the ability of banking subsidiaries to pay dividends is also subject to their profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. 
 
 The payment of dividends by the Bank and the Corporation may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory requirements. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. A depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if the regulators deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. 
 
 77 

Table of Contents 

 The amount and timing of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends upon business conditions and regulatory requirements. The Board of Directors has the discretion to change the dividend at any time for any reason. The Board of Directors presently intends to continue the policy of paying quarterly cash dividends. The amount of any future dividends will depend on economic and market conditions, the Corporation's financial condition and operating results and other factors, including applicable government regulations and policies. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 
 
 None. 
 
 ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
