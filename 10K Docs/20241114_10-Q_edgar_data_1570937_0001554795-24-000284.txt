ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OR PLAN OF OPERATION 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements are not historical
facts but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections. We may use words such as anticipate, expect, 
 intend, plan, believe, foresee, estimate and variations of these
words and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are
subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted. You should read this report completely and with the understanding
that actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this report are
made as of the date of this report and should be evaluated with consideration of any changes occurring after the date of this Report.
We will not update forward-looking statements even though our situation may change in the future and we assume no obligation to update
any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Our Business 

Altair International Corp. Altair is a development stage company that was incorporated in Nevada on December 20, 2012. The Company is currently in very preliminary discussions
with a number of acquisition targets, each of which we believe would deliver significant value to our shareholders. 

The Company is currently engaged
in identifying and assessing new business opportunities. 

Earn-In Agreement 

 On November 23, 2020, the Company
entered into an Earn-In Agreement with American Lithium Minerals, Inc. AMLM under which we agreed to make total payments
of 75,000 to AMLM in exchange for a 10 undivided interest in 63 unpatented placer mining claims comprised of approximately 1,260 acres,
and 3 unpatented lode mining claims in Nevada. This 75,000 obligation has been fully satisfied by the Company 30,000 paid 12/8/2020
and 45,000 paid 1/5/2021), resulting in Altair owning a 10 undivided interest in the claims. The Company has the option to increase
its ownership interest by an additional 50 by a total payment of 1,300,648 for exploration and development costs as follows: 100,648
within year one for an additional 10/ , 600,000 in year two for an additional 20 and 600,000 in year three for an additional 20 ownership
interest. The Earn-In Agreement grants Altair the exclusive right to explore the properties. In July 2021, the Company undertook a sampling
and testing program on the Stonewall lithium project, which returned results showing anomalous lithium content. During 2022, Altair satisfied
payment of the claim fees due to the Unites States Bureau of Land Management, and in August of 2022, Altair and AMLM entered into a 2 nd 
Amendment to the original Earn-In Agreement, which, among other things, detailed that that parties agreed that the 2021 Calendar Year
work commitment had been satisfied, and made certain changes to the required Annual Work Commitments required to be satisfied by Altair
for the 22, 23, and 24 calendar years. Further sampling and testing will be required to advance the Stonewall project. 

Effective July 11, 2024, the Company terminated its
Earned in Agreement with American Lithium Minerals, Inc. The Company maintains a 10 interest in the leases. 

License and Royalty Agreement 

 On February 10, 2021, the Company
entered into a License and Royalty Agreement (the License Agreement with St-Georges Eco-Mining Corp. SX and St-Georges Metallurgy Corp. SXM under which Altair has received a perpetual, non-exclusive license from SX of its
lithium extraction technology for Altair to develop its lithium bearing prospects in the United States and SXM s EV battery recycling
technology for which Altair has agreed to act as exclusive master agent to promote the licensing and deployment of the EV battery recycling
technology in North America. Altair has agreed to provide SX with a net revenue interest royalty on all metals and minerals extracted
(the Products and sold from Altair s mineral interests in the United States and SX has agreed to provide Altair with
a 1 trailer fee on any royalty received by SX from the licensing of the SX EV battery recycling technology to each licensee of the SX
EV battery recycling technology referred by Altair or Altair s sub-agents. Altair will pay a royalty of 5 of the net revenue received
by Altair for sales of Products using the lithium extraction technology which decreases to 3 of the net revenue on all payments in excess
of US 8,000,000 of production on an annualized basis. 

Activities of our wholly-owned subsidiary, EV Lithium
Solution, Inc. (EVLS) 

 On March 19, 2021, EVLS acquired
a 100 interest in the IP related to a novel, solid state lithium/graphene battery technology from Cryptosolar Ltd., a Company domiciled
in the United Kingdom. We continue to invest in the research and development of this technology and such development is moving forward
rapidly. We are currently in the process of patenting the technology and are exploring options for commercialization. On July 21, 2021,
the Company engaged Mr. Matthew Kiang to assist in our efforts to commercialize our battery technology, and on August 6, 2021, the Company
filed its first patent application for this technology, which referenced 20 claims. In December 2021, we received a non-final rejection
of the claims on various grounds and we have since determined that the most prudent course of action will be to file a new patent application
rather than amend the existing application. We do not currently have an established timeline for our filing of a new patent application.
We have eliminated the use of lithium in our battery platform, resulting in a technology which does not rely on any electrochemical reactions.
This development results in an energy supply with a cost that will not be affected by the fluctuations in global lithium prices, and carries
no risk of fire as lithium batteries do. We are currently and actively exploring options for commercialization of this technology, which
we have named our Energy Storage Unit, or ESU. 

Merger Agreement 

 On February 16, 2024, we entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement among Premier Air Charter, Inc. Premier ), Premier
Air Charter Merger Sub, Inc. Merger Sub ), and TIPP Aviation, LLC, the sole shareholder of Premier. Under the terms of the
Merger Agreement, Altair will exchange 85 of its shares of common stock for all issued and outstanding shares of Premier common stock
and Merger Sub will be merged into Premier (the Merger ). The officers and directors of Premier will be the officers and
directors of Altair following the Merger. The closing of the Merger is subject to a number of pre-conditions, including Premier
providing two years of audited financial statements by a PCAOB registered accounting firm. Presently, Altair and Premier are working
diligently to satisfy those preconditions with an intent to close the Merger as soon as possible.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

We have incurred recurring losses
to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and accordingly do not include
adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
we be unable to continue in operation. 

We expect we will require additional
capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing
cash on hand, loans from third parties and\or private placements of common stock. No assurance can be given that such funds will be available. 

Results of operations for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenues 

 The Company has not recognized any revenue to date. 

Compensation expense related party, for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 12,000 compared to 12,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company

three months ended September 30, 2024, were 24,150 compared to 32,957 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 8,807
or 26.7 . The decrease is due to no funds being spent on mining exploration expenses. 

Other Expense 

 Total other expense
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 2,998, for interest expense. Total other income for the three months ended September
30, 2023, was 12,383, consisting of 39,149 of interest expense, which includes 35,203 of debt discount amortization. We also had a
gain on the change in the fair value of the derivative of 51,532.

or 18.3 . The decrease is due to no funds being spent on mining exploration expense. 

Other Expense 

 Total other expense
for the six months ended September 30, 2024, was 11,556, for interest expense, which includes 5,210 of debt discount amortization. The
total other expense for the six months ended September 30, 2023, was 117,668, consisting of 73,533 of interest expense, which includes

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash flow used in Operating Activities. 

 We have not generated positive cash flows from operating
activities. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used 56,437 of cash for operating activities compared to 75,867
of cash for operating activities in the prior period. 

Cash flow from Financing Activities 

 We have financed our operations primarily from either
advancements or the issuance of equity and debt instruments. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received 52,600
of cash from a related party. In the prior period we received 55,000 of cash from the issuance of a convertible note. 

Going Concern 

We have not attained profitable
operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons, our auditors
stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going
concern without further financing. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern,"
which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no significant off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

Future Financings 

We will continue to rely on equity
sales of our common shares or debt financing arrangements in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuance of additional
shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity
securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Refer to our Form 10-K for the
year ended March 31, 2024, for a full discussion of our critical accounting policies.

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting company
as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. 

ITEM 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Management s Report Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 

During the quarter ended September
30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that,
as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the required time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

Our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error
or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 

To address the material weaknesses,
we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures in an effort to ensure our financial statements included in this annual
report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, we engaged accounting consultants
to assist in the preparation of our financial statements. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included
in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

15 

Management s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting 

Internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process designed by, or under the supervision of,
our principal executive and principal financial officers, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over our financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
using the Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

We are aware of the following
material weaknesses in internal control that could adversely affect the Company s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data: 

Due to our size and limited resources, we currently do not employ the appropriate accounting personnel to ensure (a) we maintain proper segregation of duties, (b) that all transactions are entered timely and accurately, and (c) we properly account for complex or unusual transactions 

Due to our size and scope of operations, we currently do not have an independent audit committee in place 

Due to our size and limited resources, we have not properly documented a complete assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

Internal control over financial
reporting has inherent limitations, which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance,
interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel
factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process, which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses
in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion
or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible
to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in
our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially or are
reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
