CAUTIONARY NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These statements include, but are not limited to, our expectations or predictions of future financial or business performance or conditions. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning our possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words believes, estimates, expects, projects, forecasts, may, will, should, seeks, plans, scheduled, anticipates, or intends or similar expressions. 
 Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A include, but are not limited to, statements about our ability to, or expectations that we will: 
 meet the technical requirements of existing or future supply agreements with our customers, including with respect to existing backlog; 
 expand our target customer base and maintain our existing customer base; 
 realize the benefits expected from the GreenBox joint venture and the Commercial Agreement with GreenBox (each as defined herein);

 acquire, maintain, protect, and enforce intellectual property; 
 attract, train, and retain effective officers, key employees, or directors; 
 comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business; 
 stay abreast of modified or new laws and regulations applicable to our business; 
 execute our growth strategy;

 Forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A also include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: 
 the future performance of our business and operations; 
 expectations regarding revenues, expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and anticipated cash needs; 
 expectations regarding cash flow, liquidity and sources of funding; 
 expectations regarding capital expenditures; 
 the anticipated benefits of Symbotic s leadership structure; 
 the effects of pending and future legislation; 
 business disruption; 
 disruption to the business due to our dependency on certain customers; 
 increasing competition in the warehouse automation industry; 
 any delays in the design, production or launch of our systems and products; 
 iii 

the failure to meet customers' requirements under existing or future contracts or customer's expectations as to price or pricing structure; 
 any defects in new products or enhancements to existing products; and 
 the fluctuation of operating results from period to period due to a number of factors, including the pace of customer adoption of our new products and services and any changes in our product mix that shift too far into lower gross margin products. 
 Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. Certain of these risks are identified and discussed in other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on December 11, 2023, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024. These risk factors will be important to consider in determining future results and should be reviewed in their entirety. These forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith, and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that the events, results or trends identified in these forward-looking statements will occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purposes of assisting the reader in understanding our financial performance, financial position and cash flows as of and for periods ended on certain dates and to present information about management s current expectations and plans relating to the future, and the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements because of their inherent uncertainty and to appreciate the limited purposes for which they are being used by management. While we believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on information currently available to management, there is no assurance that such assumptions and expectations will prove to have been correct. 
 The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made and are based on the beliefs, estimates, expectations and opinions of management on that date. We are not under any obligation, and expressly disclaim any obligation, to update, alter or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 
 In addition to factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 11, 2023, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024, and those identified elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: failure to realize the benefits expected from adding to Symbotic s base of outsourcing partners and the effects of pending and future legislation. 
 Annualized and estimated numbers are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results. 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A, the terms Symbotic, we, us, and our refer to Symbotic Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.

 Unbilled accounts receivable Contract liabilities 
 The change in the opening and closing balances of the Company s accounts receivable primarily results from the increase in customer system implementations in the current fiscal year as well as the timing of when customer payments are due. The change in the opening and closing balances of the Company s contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Company s performance and customer payments. The Company s performance obligations are typically satisfied over time as work is performed. Payment from customers can vary, and is often received in advance of satisfaction of the performance obligations, resulting in a contract liability balance. During the six months ended March 30, 2024, the Company recognized million of the contract liability balance at September 30, 2023, as revenue upon transfer of the products or services to customers. During the six months ended March 25, 2023, the Company recognized million of the contract liability balance at September 24, 2022, as revenue upon transfer of the products or services to customers.

 million. Payments made under the TRA represent payments that otherwise would have been made to taxing authorities in the absence of attributes obtained by the Company as a result of exchanges by its pre-IPO members. Such amounts will be paid only when a cash tax savings is realized as a result of attributes subject to the TRA. That is, payments under the TRA are only expected to be made in periods following the filing of a tax return in which the Company is able to utilize certain tax benefits to reduce its cash taxes paid to a taxing authority. The impact of any changes in the projected obligations under the TRA as a result of changes in the geographic mix of the Company s earnings, changes in tax legislation and tax rates or other factors that may impact the Company s tax savings will be reflected in income or loss before taxes on the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the change occurs. As of March 30, 2024, TRA liability was recorded based on the amount expected to be paid for cash tax savings related to fiscal year 2024. No TRA liability was recorded for periods after fiscal year 2024 based on current projections of future taxable income and taking into consideration the Company s full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset.

 Company Overview 
 At Symbotic, our vision is to make the supply chain work better for everyone. We do this by developing, commercializing, and deploying innovative, end-to-end technology solutions that dramatically improve supply chain operations. We currently automate the processing of pallets and cases in large warehouses or distribution centers for some of the largest retail companies in the world. Our systems enhance operations at the front end of the supply chain, and therefore benefit all supply partners further down the chain, irrespective of fulfillment strategy. 
 The Symbotic platform is based on a unique approach to connecting producers of goods to end users, in a way that resolves the mismatches of quantity, timing and location that arise between the two, while reducing costs. The underlying architecture of our platform is what differentiates our solution from anything else in the marketplace. It utilizes fully autonomous robots, collectively controlled by our A.I. enabled system software to achieve at scale, real world supply chain improvements that are so compelling that we believe our approach can become the de facto standard approach for how warehouses operate. 
 Key Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue through our design and installation of modular inventory management systems (the Systems to automate customers depalletizing, storage, selection, and palletization warehousing processes. The Systems have both a hardware component and an embedded software component that enables the systems to be programmed to operate within specific customer environments. We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of services to design and install the Systems. These services are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, each customer contract may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether performance obligations are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to provide the services to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. 
 We have identified the following distinct performance obligations in our contracts with customers: 
 Systems : We design, assemble, and install modular hardware systems and perform configuration of embedded software. Systems include the delivery of hardware and an embedded software component, sold as either a perpetual or term-based on-premise license, that automate our customers depalletizing, storage, selection, and palletization warehousing processes. The 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 modular hardware and embedded software are each not capable of being distinct because our customers cannot benefit from the hardware or software on their own. Accordingly, they are treated as a single performance obligation. Fees for systems are typically either fixed or cost-plus fixed fee amounts that are due based on the achievement of a variety of milestones beginning at contract inception through final acceptance. The substantial majority of our embedded software component is sold as a perpetual on-premise license, however, we do sell an immaterial amount of term-based on-premise licenses. 
 The key metrics which describe our System from commencement to completion are as follows: (1) Start occurs when a Statement of Work SOW is signed with a customer; (2) Deployment is defined as the period of time following the signed SOW until acceptance is achieved on the System; (3) Operational describes a System which has achieved acceptance. The majority of Systems revenue occurs during the deployment stage, and once a system reaches acceptance, software maintenance and support begins. 
 Software maintenance and support : Software maintenance and support refer to support services that provide our customers with technical support, updates, and upgrades to the embedded software license. Fees for the software maintenance and support services are typically payable in advance on a quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the software maintenance and support service contract, which term can range from one to 15 years but, for a substantial majority of our software maintenance and support contracts, is 15 years. 
 Operation services : We provide our customers with assistance operating the system and ensuring user experience is optimized for efficiency and effectiveness. Fees for operation services are typically invoiced to our customers on a time and materials basis monthly in arrears or using a fixed fee structure. Also included in operation services is revenue generated from the sales of spare parts to our customers as needed to service their System. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Our cost of revenue is composed of the following for each of our distinct performance obligations: 
 Systems : Systems cost of revenue consists primarily of material and labor consumed in the production and installation of customer Systems, as well as depreciation expense. The design, assembly, and installation of a system includes substantive customer-specified acceptance criteria that allow the customer to accept or reject systems that do not meet the customer s specifications. When we cannot objectively determine that acceptance criteria will be met upon contract inception, cost of revenue relating to systems is deferred and expensed at a point in time upon final acceptance from the customer. If acceptance can be reasonably certain upon contract inception, systems cost of revenue is expensed as incurred. 
 Software maintenance and support : Cost of revenue attributable to software maintenance and support primarily relates to labor cost for our maintenance team providing routine technical support, and maintenance updates and upgrades to our customers. Software maintenance and support cost of revenue is expensed as incurred. 
 Operation services : Operation services cost of revenue consists primarily of labor cost for our operations team who is providing services to our customers to run their System within their distribution center. Operation services cost of revenue also includes the cost of spare parts sold to our customers as needed to service their System. Operation services cost of revenue is expensed as incurred. 
 Research and Development 
 Costs incurred in the research and development of our products are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs include personnel, contracted services, materials, and indirect costs involved in the design and development of new products and services, as well as depreciation expense. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses include all costs that are not directly related to satisfaction of customer contracts or research and development. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include items for our selling and administrative functions, such as sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology support. These functions include costs for items such as salaries and benefits and other personnel-related costs, maintenance and supplies, professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services, intangible asset amortization, and depreciation expense. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net primarily consists of dividend and interest income earned on our money market accounts and the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses associated with monetary assets and liabilities.

 The increase in operation services gross profit is driven by an increase to the number of sites where we are performing operation services, efficiency improvement on our existing operation services sites, and profit generated from the sales of spare parts. 
 The following table sets forth our gross profit for the six months ended March 30, 2024 and March 25, 2023:

 Systems gross profit increased 10.8 million during the six months ended March 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended March 25, 2023. The increase in systems gross profit was partially driven by the increased number of sites in deployment in fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023. This increase was offset by the completion of our restructuring related to outsource of bot assembly and component inventory management, including standardizing on Symbot as our go-ahead bot platform. As a result of this, we recognized a restructuring charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024.

 The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended March 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 25, 2023 is due to the following: 
 Change (in thousands) Employee-related costs (2,715) Prototyping-related costs, allocated overhead expenses, and other (489) (3,204) 
 Employee-related costs decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and expense incurred for contractors. As we apply the graded-vesting method of expense recognition to all stock-based compensation awards with service-only conditions, higher expense was incurred for the three months ended March 25, 2023 due to the expense recognized in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 for the issuance of restricted stock to our employees following the Business Combination. Additionally, we experienced a decrease in the expense related to contractors as a result of a combination of hiring full time employees and outsourcing certain business activities to third parties. These decreases were partially offset by an increase to payroll related costs as we continue to grow our software and hardware engineering

 organizations to support the development of key projects such as next generation autonomous electric vehicle robots, and also to support the continued expansion of our artificial intelligence and analytics capabilities. 
 Prototyping-related costs, allocated overhead expenses, and other expenses remained relatively flat for the three months ended March 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 25, 2023 though we did experience less expense related to prototyping-related costs resulting from outsourcing of prototyping-related work to third party vendors.

 The decrease in research and development expenses for the six months ended March 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended March 25, 2023 is due to the following: 
 Change (in thousands) Employee-related costs (13,172) Prototyping-related costs, allocated overhead expenses, and other 1,372 (11,800) 
 Employee-related costs decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and expense incurred for contractors. As we apply the graded-vesting method of expense recognition to all stock-based compensation awards with service-only conditions, higher expense was incurred for the six months ended March 25, 2023 due to the expense recognized in the first half of fiscal year 2023 for the issuance of restricted stock to our employees following the Business Combination. Additionally, we experienced a decrease in the expense related to contractors as a result of a combination of hiring full time employees and outsourcing certain business activities to third parties. These decreases were partially offset by an increase to payroll related costs as we continue to grow our software and hardware engineering organizations to support the development of key projects such as next generation autonomous electric vehicle robots, and also to support the continued expansion of our artificial intelligence and analytics capabilities. 
 The increase in prototyping-related costs, allocated overhead expenses, and other during the six months ended March 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended March 25, 2023 is partially attributable to an increase in prototyping-related expenses incurred by us in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 as we are implementing efforts to expand on our current product offerings. There was additionally an increase in overhead expenses allocated from selling, general, and administrative expenses to research and development expenses resulting from an increase to general overhead expenses such as rent and other occupancy expenses for the six months ended March 30, 2024.

 Allocated overhead expenses and other 6,676 (2,246) 
 Employee-related costs decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and expense incurred for contractors. As we apply the graded-vesting method of expense recognition to all stock-based compensation awards with service-only conditions, higher expense was incurred for the three months ended March 25, 2023 due to the expense recognized in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 for the issuance of restricted stock to our employees following the Business Combination. Additionally, we experienced a decrease in the expense related to contractors as a result of a combination of hiring full time employees and outsourcing certain business activities to third parties. These decreases were partially offset by an increase to payroll-related expenses incurred as our business continues to grow. 
 Allocated overhead and other expenses increased primarily due to an increase in information technology related costs as well as audit, tax, and legal expenses as compared to the prior year as our employee base and infrastructure continue to grow.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, we provide additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, or non-GAAP financial measures. We use these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation, and to evaluate our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross profit, and Adjusted gross profit margin, as discussed below. 
 We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as it facilitates comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. We also believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as we do. These non-GAAP financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent, or not reflective of our ongoing operating results. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net loss excluding the following items: interest income; income taxes; depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets; stock-based compensation; CEO transition charges; Joint venture formation fees; restructuring charges; equity financing transaction costs; and other infrequent items that may arise from time to time.

Table of Contents 

 The non-GAAP adjustments, and our basis for excluding them from our non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below: 
 Stock-based compensation Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to our employees, the grant date fair value varies based on the derived stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of award types. This makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret; therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP financial measures in order to highlight the performance of our business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate our performance and compare our operating results to peer companies. Our stock-based compensation non-GAAP financial measures exclusion includes non-cash stock-based compensation expense and payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation awards. 
 CEO transition charges CEO transition charges represent the charges incurred associated with the separation agreement we entered into with Michael Loparco in November 2022. We exclude these CEO transition charges from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts are not representative of our normal operating activities. 
 Restructuring charges Restructuring charges represent the charges incurred associated with certain actions to restructure parts of the Company within the U.S. and Canada. These charges include severance and related expenses for workforce reductions, lower of cost and net realizable value adjustments to inventory and long-lived assets that will no longer be used in operations, and termination fees for any contracts cancelled as part of these programs. We exclude these items from our non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect future expected operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business. 
 Joint venture formation fees Joint venture formation fees represent the charges incurred associated with the formation of GreenBox, which was established on July 21, 2023. It primarily includes investment banker fees, legal fees, transaction fees, advisory fees, and certain other professional fees. We exclude joint venture formation fees from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of the joint venture and do not reflect our core operations. 
 Equity financing transaction costs Equity financing transaction costs represents the costs incurred, including for legal, professional fees for accountants, transaction fees, advisory fees, due diligence costs, and certain other professional fees that are directly related to an equity financing transaction.

 The following table shows net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, net cash provided by (used in) investing activities, and net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the six months ended March 30, 2024 and March 25, 2023: 
 Six Months Ended March 30, 2024 March 25, 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (9,078) 132,364 Investing activities 235,476 (216,147) Financing activities 416,941 (10,726) 
 Operating Activities 
 Our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities consists of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, foreign currency gains and losses, marketable securities gains and losses, provision for excess and obsolete inventory, and stock-based compensation, as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities. The primary changes in working capital items, such as the changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, result from the difference in timing of payments from our customers related to system installations and the associated costs incurred by us to fulfill the system installation performance obligation. This may result in an operating cash flow source or use for the period, depending on the timing of payments received as compared to the fulfillment of the system installation performance obligation. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was (9.1) million during the six months ended March 30, 2024. Net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to our net loss of (73.9) million adjusted for non-cash items of 89.4 million, primarily consisting of 6.4 million depreciation and amortization, 57.5 million stock-based compensation, and 34.3 million provision for excess and obsolete inventory, in addition to cash used in operating assets and liabilities of 24.6 million. Cash used in operating assets and liabilities of 24.6 million was primarily driven by net working capital changes, including the timing of cash payments to vendors and cash receipts from customers. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 132.4 million during the six months ended March 25, 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to our net loss of 123.4 million adjusted for non-cash items of 95.2 million, primarily consisting of 4.1 million depreciation and amortization, 6.2 million provision for excess and obsolete inventory, and 84.8 million stock-based compensation, offset by cash provided by operating assets and liabilities of 160.6 million. Cash provided by operating assets and liabilities of 160.6 million was primarily driven by net working capital changes, including timing of cash payments to vendors and cash receipts from customers, an increase in inventory purchases for the six months ended March 25, 2023 as we purchase additional inventory in order to meet our installation timeline for our customers upcoming warehouse automation system installations in connection with the Walmart Master Automation Agreement and other customer contracts, as well as an increase in deferred revenue for the six months ended March 25, 2023 resulting from an increase in the number of active system installation projects. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our investing activities have consisted primarily of property and equipment purchases, capitalization of internal use software development costs, purchases of marketable securities, and proceeds from maturities of marketable securities. 
 Net cash and cash equivalents provided by investing activities during the six months ended March 30, 2024 is primarily driven by 290.0 million in proceeds upon the maturity of certain U.S. Treasury securities, offset by purchases of U.S. Treasury securities of 48.7 million. 
 Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during the six months ended March 25, 2023 consisted of 13.0 million of purchased property and equipment. Additionally, during the six months ended March 25, 2023, we purchased U.S. Treasury securities for 203.1 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Our financing activities typically consist of payments and proceeds related to our equity incentive plans for both RSUs and ESPP, and also include proceeds from the exercise of the vested warrants issued to Walmart as well as proceeds from equity financing transactions. 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 During the six months ended March 30, 2024, we received cash of 158.7 million upon the gross exercise of Walmart s vested warrant units, which occurred in December 2023. We additionally received proceeds of 258.0 million in relation to issuance of Class A common stock upon completion of our equity financing transaction in March 2024. No other significant financing activities occurred during the six months ended March 30, 2024. 
 During the six months ended March 25, 2023, we incurred a payment of 11.7 million for the taxes related to the net share settlement of stock-based compensation awards. We also received proceeds of 1.0 million from the issuance of common stock under the ESPP upon the expiration of the first offering period which occurred at the end of December 2022. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments and Liquidity Outlook 
 Our cash flows from operations along with equity infusions have historically been sufficient to fund our operating activities and other cash requirements. As of March 30, 2024, we have a cash and cash equivalents balance of 901.4 million and short-term available for sale marketable securities balance of 50.0 million. Our cash requirements for the six months ended March 30, 2024 were primarily related to inventory purchases in order to deliver to our customers our warehouse automation systems in an orderly manner in line with our installation timeline, purchases of marketable securities in order to diversify the composition of our cash balance, and capital expenditures. 
 Based on our present business plan, we expect our current cash and cash equivalents, unrestricted marketable securities, working capital, and our forecasted cash flows from operations to be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our foreseeable cash needs, in addition to our recurring operating expenses, include our expected capital expenditures to support expansion of our infrastructure and workforce, and minimum contractual obligations. Contractual obligations are cash that we are obligated to pay as part of certain contracts that we have entered into during our course of business. Our contractual obligations consist of operating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet and vendor commitments associated with agreements that are legally binding. Our operating lease cash requirements have not changed materially since September 30, 2023, and are disclosed within Note 6, Leases , included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. 
 The following table summarizes our current and long-term material cash requirements as of March 30, 2024 for our vendor commitments: 
 Payments due in: Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Vendor commitments 1,200,414 1,186,849 13,565 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, and the cost of any future acquisitions of technology or businesses. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may be unable to raise the funds on acceptable terms, if at all. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the six months ended March 30, 2024 as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023, which are included within the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 11, 2023. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of March 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Instruction 8 to Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes in our assessment of our sensitivity to market risk since our presentation set forth in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 11, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of March 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level because of the existence of the material weaknesses described below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 As of March 30, 2024, the Company did not effectively design procedures and controls over the timing of the recognition of cost of revenue. This resulted in the acceleration of the recognition of cost of revenue. Given that we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis, this resulted in the acceleration of recognition of revenue. Additionally, the Company did not effectively design and execute controls over revenue recognition related to cost overruns on certain deployments that will not be billable. This resulted in an overstatement of revenue during the year. These deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting constituted material weaknesses as of March 30, 2024. 
 Notwithstanding the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of our operations and our cash flows for the periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A, in conformity with U.S. GAAP. There can be no assurance that these material weaknesses will not result in a misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements for future periods that would not be prevented or detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Subject to the matters set forth below under Material Weakness Remediation Plan , there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the three months ended March 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Material Weakness Remediation Plan 
 Management has developed a remediation plan, which it began implementing as of the end of fiscal year 2024, that includes the following elements: 
 Augmented compensating controls over the receipt of goods and services, with a focus on milestone related expenses; 
 Implemented ERP system enhancements for goods and services receipts and enhanced documentation requirements for milestone related expenses; 
 Training of the employees and redesign of the structure of the organization receiving goods and services; and 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 Implemented compensating controls over revenue recognition for non-billable cost overruns. 
 Management is committed to the completion of the remediation of these material weaknesses and expects to successfully implement enhanced control processes. Management has also engaged third-party consultants to evaluate and help simplify business processes around the receipts of goods and services. However, as management continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, it may determine that additional measures to address control deficiencies or modifications to the remediation plan are necessary. Therefore, management cannot assure you when these material weaknesses will be remediated, that additional actions will not be required to remediate these material weaknesses, or the costs of any such additional actions. These material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through further testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 ERP System Implementation 
 The Company has completed its new enterprise resource planning ERP system implementation, SAP s S4/HANA which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related business processes. The implementation of SAP s S4/HANA is expected to strengthen the financial controls by automating certain manual processes and standardizing business processes and reporting across the organization. The Company will continue to evaluate and monitor the internal controls over financial reporting during this period of change and will continue to evaluate the operating effectiveness of related key controls. For a discussion of risks related to the implementation of new systems, please see the section in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024 titled Risk Factors . 
 
 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We may be subject from time to time to various claims, lawsuits, and other legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings may involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties, and could result in damages, fines, and penalties, non-monetary sanctions, or relief. We intend to recognize provisions for claims or pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertain nature of litigation, the ultimate outcome or actual cost of settlement may materially vary from estimates. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. For a detailed discussion of these risks, please see the section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 11, 2023 titled Risk Factors . Any of the matters highlighted in those risk factors and the risk factor below could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition. 
 We are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting and our management has identified material weaknesses. If our remediation of the material weaknesses is not effective, or we identify additional material weaknesses or other adverse findings in the future, our ability to report our financial condition or results of operations accurately or timely or prevent fraud may be adversely affected, which may result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies, and ultimately have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. 
 Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. As we are no longer an emerging growth company as of the end of the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, to achieve compliance with Section 404, we are required to document and test the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. Annually, we perform activities that include reviewing, documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we fail to achieve and

 maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could result in significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies and lead to a decline in our stock price. 
 Our management has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 30, 2024. Based upon this evaluation and those criteria, management concluded that, as of March 30, 2024, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the identification of material weaknesses. As of March 30, 2024, the Company did not effectively design procedures and controls over the timing of the recognition of cost of revenue. This resulted in the acceleration of the recognition of cost of revenue. Given that we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis, this resulted in the acceleration of recognition of revenue. Additionally, the Company did not effectively design and execute controls over revenue recognition related to cost overruns on certain deployments that will not be billable. This resulted in an overstatement of revenue during the year. These deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting constituted material weaknesses. For further discussion of these material weaknesses, see Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures . A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 We may be unable to conclude in future periods that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective due to the effects of various factors, which may, in part, include unremediated material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in those reports is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and believes its remediation efforts will represent an improvement in existing controls. Management anticipates that the new controls, as implemented and when tested for a sufficient period of time, will remediate the material weaknesses. We may not be successful in promptly remediating the material weaknesses identified by management or be able to identify and remediate additional control deficiencies, including material weaknesses, in the future. Remediation efforts have placed, and will continue to place, a significant burden on management and add increased pressure on our financial reporting resources and processes. The accuracy of our financial reporting and our ability to timely file with the SEC may in the future be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner, or if any additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified.
