FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include statements
preceded by, followed by or that include the words may, could, would, should, 
 believe, expect, anticipate, plan, estimate, target, 
 project, intend and similar words or expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations,
projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations
and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy
and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks
and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial
condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these
forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those
indicated in the forward-looking statements. Investors should carefully consider all of such risks before making an investment decision
with respect to the Company s stock. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated
financial statements for Idaho Copper Corporation. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Form 10Q is based only on information
currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking
statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or
otherwise.

shares of common stock of the Company from the Seller. 

On
January 23, 2023, the Company entered into and consummated the transactions contemplated by a share exchange agreement (the Share
Exchange Agreement by and among the Company, International CuMo Mining Corporation, an Idaho corporation ICUMO ),
and all of the shareholders of ICUMO (collectively, the ICUMO Shareholders ). Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange
Agreement (the RTO ), the ICUMO Shareholders transferred all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of ICUMO
to the Company in exchange for shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share. As a result of this
share exchange (the Exchange ), ICUMO became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. See Note 7. For financial reporting
purposes, the acquisition of ICUMO and the change of control in connection with the acquisition represented a reverse merger 
and ICUMO is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction. ICUMO is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, and the
Company is the acquired company. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the operations that are reflected in the historical financial
statements prior to the acquisition are those of ICUMO. 

The
Company continues to be a smaller reporting company, as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act following the Exchange, however, as a result of the Exchange, the Company has ceased to be a shell company 
(as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act). 

ICUMO
Background 

ICUMO
is an exploration and development company with mineral right interests in the United States of America. ICUMO was originally incorporated
under the laws of Nevada in 2005, as Mosquito Mining Corp. In 2013, the Company was moved to Idaho and the name changed to Idaho CuMo
Mining Corporation. In early February 2023 the name was changed to Idaho Copper Corporation. 

Nature
of Operations 

The
Company is in the process of exploring its mineral rights interests in the United States and as of the date of these condensed
consolidated financial statements, has not yet determined whether any of its mineral properties contain economically recoverable
mineral reserves. Accordingly, the carrying amount of mineral right interests represents cumulative expenditures incurred to date
and does not necessarily reflect present or future values. The recovery of these costs is dependent upon the discovery of
economically recoverable mineral reserves and the ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to complete their
exploration and development and to resolve any environmental, regulatory, or other constraints. Uncertainty also exists with respect
to the recoverability of the carrying value of certain mineral rights interests. The ability of the Company to realize its
investment in resource properties is contingent upon the resolution of the uncertainties and confirmation of the Company s
title to the mineral properties. 

in cash. Our net loss incurred for the nine months
ended October 31, 2024, was and the working capital deficit was on October 31, 2024. As a result, there is substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operating
activities or raise additional funds, we may be required to delay, reduce or severely curtail our operations or otherwise impede our
on-going business efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and long-term
prospects. The Company expects to seek to obtain additional funding through increased revenues and future financing. There can be no
assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be available. The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. 

. From time to time, the Company
has certain cash balances, including restricted cash, that may exceed insured limits. The Company utilizes large and reputable banking
institutions which it believes mitigates these risks. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. As of October 31,
2024, the Company s cash balance did t exceed the insurance limits.

for the remaining balance of the unamortized beneficial conversion features attributable to its outstanding convertible notes
payable. The Company elected to use the modified retrospective approach as of the adoption date and recognized an adjustment to the
opening balance of its accumulated deficit in the amount of . 

. The Company has a deposit of (as
reflected in Deposit on the balance sheet) for the reclamation bond which has a face value of as determined by the United
States Department of Agriculture Forest Service. 

The
security deposit is refundable when the Company completes the required reclamation clean-up costs.

If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. If

The
Company entered into a new long-term lease agreement for warehouse space in Idaho. The lease began on April 1, 2024, with an initial
period of years and an optional -year renewal at the end of the initial term. The Company may cancel the lease at any time after 13
months from the effective date of the lease by providing a 3-month notice of cancellation. The base lease payment is through January

ITEM
2 - MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
statements contained in the following MD A and elsewhere throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including any documents incorporated
by reference, that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements preceded
by, followed by or that include the words may, could, would, should, believe, 
 expect, anticipate, plan, estimate, target, project, 
 intend and similar words or expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other
characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. 

These
forward-looking statements, which reflect our management s beliefs, objectives, and expectations as of the date hereof, are based
on the best judgment of our management. All forward-looking statements made by us in this Form 10-Q are based only on information currently
available to us and speak only as of the date on which they are made. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties
and assumptions relating to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements, including,
without limitation, the following: economic, social and political conditions, global economic downturns resulting from extraordinary
events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other securities industry risks; interest rate risks; liquidity risks; credit risk with clients
and counterparties; risk of liability for errors in clearing functions; systemic risk; systems failures, delays and capacity constraints;
network security risks; competition; reliance on external service providers; new laws and regulations affecting our business; net capital
requirements; extensive regulation, regulatory uncertainties and legal matters; failure to maintain relationships with employees, customers,
business partners or governmental entities; the inability to achieve synergies or to implement integration plans and other consequences
associated with risks and uncertainties detailed in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent filings on Forms 8-K, 10-K and
10-Q. 

We
caution that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive, and new factors may emerge, or changes to the foregoing factors may occur,
that could impact our business. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by the federal securities laws. 

This
discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements filed on our Form 8-K on January 27, 2023, our 2024 Form 10-K,
and our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Nature
of Operations 

The
Company is in the process of exploring its mineral right interests in the United States and at the date of these condensed consolidated
financial statements, has not yet determined whether any of its mineral properties contain economically recoverable mineral reserves.
Accordingly, the carrying amount of mineral right interests represents cumulative expenditures incurred to date and does not necessarily
reflect present or future values. The recovery of these costs is dependent upon the discovery of economically recoverable mineral reserves
and the ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to complete their exploration and development and to resolve any environmental,
regulatory, or other constraints. Uncertainty also exists with respect to the recoverability of the carrying value of certain mineral
right interests. The ability of the Company to realize its investment in resource properties is contingent upon the maintenance and integrity
of the Company s title to such properties. 

Mining
Property 

To
determine material mining operations in accordance with subpart 1300 of SEC Regulation S-K, management considered both quantitative and
qualitative factors, assessed in the context of the Company s overall business and financial condition. The Company concluded that,
as of the date of the filing of this Report, its sole material mining operation is the CuMo Project. The Company will update its assessment
of individual material mines on an annual basis. 

The
information relating to such sole material mining operation is contained in the technical report summary TRS relating
to the CuMo Project prepared in compliance with the Item 601(b)(96) and subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. Reference should be made to the
full text of the TRS, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 96.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K, dated January 27, 2023. 

Pursuant
to Item 1302(b)(5) of Regulation S-K (17 C.F.R. 229.1302(b)(5)), the Company states that the TRS was prepared by Shaun M. Dykes,
M. Sc. (Eng), P.Geo of Geologic Systems, Ltd. Mr. Dykes is also serving as a technical advisor to the registrant. Mr. Dykes meets the
qualifications specified under the definition of qualified person under Item 1300 of Regulation S-K. 

The
CuMo Project currently consists of one hundred and twenty-six (126) federal unpatented lode mining claims, and six (6) patented mining
claims. In total, the project comprises approximately 2,640 acres. The unpatented lode mining claims and patented claims are situated
in an unorganized mining district, in Boise County, Idaho, spanning Sections in Township 7N and 8N, Range 5E and 6E, Boise Meridian. 

No
assurances can be given that any of these plans will come to fruition or that if implemented they will necessarily yield positive results. 

Independent
Valuation 

On
March 3, 2023, an independent valuation firm issued a valuation of the assets, specifically the CuMo project in Boise County, Idaho,
acquired by the Company in the ICUMO transaction. The CuMo project is a molybdenum-copper deposit that will be developed as an open pit
mining operation. The fair market value of the assets were 23,919,754.

Off-balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that are material to investors. 

Results
of Operations 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, and 2023, and related management discussion
herein. 

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements are stated in U.S. Dollars and are prepared in accordance with US GAAP. 

Going
Concern Qualification 

Several
conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred
cumulative net losses of 36,438,438 from its inception to October 31, 2024, and requires capital for its contemplated operational and
marketing activities to take place. The Company s ability to raise additional capital through debt or future issuances of capital
stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company s contemplated plan of operations,
and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The
ability to successfully resolve these factors raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

For
the three months ended October 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 

Revenue 

The
Company has had no revenue historically to date. 

Operating
Expenses 

The
Company had operating expenses of 2,204,968 for the three months ended October 31, 2024, compared to 436,726 for the three months ended
October 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in stock-based compensation 1,704,024 for the three months ended October
31, 2024 compared to 0 for the same period in 2023), professional fees 285,336 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared
to 100,821 for the same period in 2023), rent expense 28,800 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 10,500 for the
same period in 2023), and other general and administrative expenses 126,808 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to
 42,905 for the same period in 2023), offset by the decrease in payroll and related expenses 60,000 for the three months ended October
31, 2024 compared to 282,500 for the same period in 2023. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily due to the conversion
of officers accrued compensation into common stock. The increase in rent expense was due to larger facility needs. The increase
in other general and administrative costs was primarily due to scanning services for the quarter. The decrease in payroll and related
expenses was primarily due to officers converting accrued compensation into common stock. 

Other
Income / Expenses 

The
Company had other expenses, net, of 147,613 for the three months ended October 31, 2024, compared to 143,732 of expense for the three
months ended October 31. 2023. 

Net
Loss 

The
Company had a net loss of 2,352,581 for the three months ended October 31, 2024, compared to 580,459 for the three months ended October
31, 2023. 

For
the nine months ended October 31, 2024, compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2023 

Revenue 

The
Company has had no revenue historically to date. 

Operating
Expenses 

The
Company had operating expenses of 4,123,390 for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, compared to 1,236,821 for the nine months ended
October 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in stock-based compensation expenses 2,258,080 for the nine months
ended October 31, 2024 compared to 140,739 for the same period in 2024), professional fees 625,945 for the nine months ended October
31, 2024 compared to 357,622 for the same period in 2023), rent expense 171,885 for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 compared
to 31,500 for the same period in 2023), and other general and administrative expenses 554,830 for the nine months ended October 31,
2024 compared to 67,459 for the same period in 2023), offset by the decrease in payroll and payroll related expenses 512,650 for the
nine months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 639,500 for the same period in 2023). The decrease in payroll and related expenses is
related to the conversion of accrued payroll into common stock offset by a pay increase for two officers. The increase in rent expense
is primarily due to a settlement of 100,000 and the larger facility rented. The increase in other general and administrative expenses
was primarily due to scanning services of 413,608. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily due to conversions of accrued
compensation for officers and the issuances of common stock to various third parties for services. The increase in professional fees
relates to increased services required for funding activities and the preparation for the filing of Form S-1. 

Other
Income / Expenses 

The
Company had other expenses, net, of 309,439 for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, compared to expenses of 506,170 for the nine
months ended October 31. 2023.

Net
Loss 

The
Company had a net loss of 4,432,829 for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, compared to 1,742,989 for the nine months ended October
31, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of October 31, 2024, the Company had cash of 18,731. We do not have sufficient resources to effectuate our business. We expect to incur
expenses offset by revenues during the next twelve months of operations. We estimate that these expenses will be comprised primarily
of general expenses including overhead, legal and accounting fees. The Company does not project revenue for the next few years, as is
typical in mining companies. The Company has and will continue to raise capital to fund the expenses. To maintain our plan of growth,
we need to raise a minimum of an additional 750,000. These factors raise substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

Operations
used cash of 2,071,799 for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, compared to cash used of 614,860 for the same period in 2023. 

We
used cash in financing activities of 0 for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, compared to 0 for the same period in 2023. 

We
had cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, of 2,060,384 compared to 201,200 for the same
period in 2023. 

We
will have to raise funds to pay for our expenses. We may have to borrow money from shareholders or issue debt or equity or enter into
a strategic arrangement with a third party. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us. We currently have
no arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. Since we
have no such arrangements or plans currently in effect, our inability to raise funds for our operations will have a severe negative impact
on our ability to remain a viable company. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this
item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term disclosure controls and procedures to mean a company s controls
and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its chief executive and
chief financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information that it is required to disclose
in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified under the SEC s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
chief executive and interim chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer / Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer / Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures are not effective as of such date. The Chief Executive Officer / Chief Financial Officer have determined that the Company
continues to have the following deficiencies which represent a material weakness: 

The
 Company does not have a majority of independent directors; 

Lack
 of in-house personnel with the technical knowledge to identify and address some of the reporting issues surrounding certain complex
 or non-routine transactions. With material, complex and non-routine transactions, management has and will continue to seek guidance
 from third-party experts and/or consultants to gain a thorough understanding of these transactions; 

Insufficient
 personnel resources within the accounting function to segregate the duties over financial transaction processing and reporting; 

Insufficient
 written policies and procedures over accounting transaction processing and period end financial disclosure and reporting processes;
 and 

To
 remediate our internal control weaknesses, management intends to implement the following measures: as funding permits, the Company
 will add sufficient accounting personnel to properly segregate duties and to effect a timely, accurate preparation of the financial
 statements; the Company will hire staff technically proficient at applying U.S. GAAP to financial transactions and reporting; and
 upon the hiring of additional accounting personnel, the Company will develop and maintain adequate written accounting policies and
 procedures. 

The
additional hiring is contingent upon The Company s efforts to obtain additional funding through equity or debt and the results
of its operations. Management hopes to secure funds in the coming fiscal year but provides no assurances that it will be able to do so. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls 

The
Company s officers do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will
prevent or detect all error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of the control system must reflect that there are
resource constraints and that the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to
risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies
or procedures.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During
the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report, there has been a significant change in our internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. With the transaction with ICUMO, the Company has an independent accounting company which has
provided a separation of duties. 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However,
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these, or other matters may arise from time to time that may
harm our business. Except as set forth below, we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened legal proceedings or claims
that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.
