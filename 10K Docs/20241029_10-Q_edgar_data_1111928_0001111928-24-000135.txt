 One of the Company's customers accounted for of the Company's net accounts receivable as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The Company enters into contracts to sell lasers and spare parts, for which revenue is generally recognized upon shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the contract. The Company also provides installation services and extended warranties. The Company frequently receives consideration from a customer prior to transferring goods to the customer under the terms of a sales contract. The Company records customer deposits related to these prepayments, which represent a contract liability. The Company also records deferred revenue related to installation services when consideration is received before the services have been performed. The standalone selling price for installation services is determined based on the estimated number of days of service technician time required for installation at standard service rates. The Company recognizes customer deposits and deferred revenue as net sales after control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company bills customers for extended warranties upon entering into the agreement with the customer, resulting in deferred revenue that is recognized over the period of the extended warranty contract. The Company recognizes revenue over time on contracts for the sale of large scale materials processing systems. The timing of customer payments on these contracts generally differs from the timing of revenue recognized. If revenue recognized exceeds customer payments, a contract asset is recorded and if customer payments exceed revenue recognized, a contract liability is recorded. Contract assets are included within prepaid expense and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Contract liabilities are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Certain deferred revenues related to extended warranties in excess of one year from the balance sheet date are included within other long-term liabilities and deferred income taxes on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." 
 
 Overview 
 We develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fiber lasers and diode lasers that are used for diverse applications, primarily in materials processing. We also manufacture and sell complementary products used with our lasers including optical delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, optical processing heads, in-line sensors and chillers. In addition, we offer laser-based and non-laser based systems for certain markets and applications. Our portfolio of laser solutions is used in materials processing, medical, and advanced applications. We sell our products globally to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), system integrators and end users. We market our products internationally, primarily through our direct sales force. Our major manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Germany. In response to the risks from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have ceased new investment in our Belarusian operations and expanded our manufacturing operations in Germany, the United States and Italy, and have added manufacturing capacity in Poland to meet the demand for our products and our sales and support needs. We have sales and service offices and applications laboratories worldwide. 
 We are vertically integrated such that we design and manufacture most of the key components used in our finished products, from semiconductor diodes to optical fiber preforms, finished fiber lasers and complementary products. Our vertically integrated operations allow us to reduce manufacturing costs, control quality, rapidly develop and integrate advanced products and protect our proprietary technology. 
 
 Factors and Trends That Affect Our Operations and Financial Results 
 In reading our financial statements, you should be aware of the following factors and trends that our management believes are important in understanding our financial performance. 
 Sale of our Russian Operations. On August 29, 2024, we completed the sale of our Russian subsidiary, Scientific and Technical Association IRE-Polus , pursuant to a share purchase agreement with a purchaser entity associated with Softline Projects LLC and existing management of IRE-Polus for 51.1 million. We recorded a loss on divestiture of 197.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which was included in Net loss from divestiture and sale of assets in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The loss included 59.3 million related to the carrying value of net assets of our Russian subsidiary that was in excess of net proceeds received on the sale. Included in the net assets sold was cash and cash equivalents of 74.0 million. Also included in the loss was 135.3 million related to the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income that was previously included in Stockholders' equity of our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and related sanctions, our ability to ship and receive components from our Russian operations was significantly curtailed. In response, we expanded our manufacturing capacity in Germany, the United States and Italy, and added new manufacturing capacity in Poland which effectively offset our inability to utilize the Russian operations. 
 Belarusian Operations. We manufacture laser cabinets and other mechanical components in Belarus. In response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the EU issued additional sanctions impacting commerce with Belarus on June 29, 2024, which restricted the supply of laser cabinets and other mechanical components from our factory in Belarus to our Germany operations after October 2, 2024. As a result of the sanctions and their impact on our Belarus operations, we completed an impairment analysis of our Belarus assets during the third quarter of 2024 and recorded 26.6 million of impairment of long-lived asset in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. At September 30, 2024, the remaining value of the long-lived assets in Belarus was 3.8 million, net working capital excluding cash was 0.4 million and cash was 5.8 million. The net asset value of our Belarus subsidiary has been reduced by 17.9 million due to the cumulative translation effect of the Belarusian ruble compared to the U.S. dollar, which is included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of stockholders' equity. We may incur additional asset impairment charges related to the Belarus operations and the other comprehensive loss that is currently in the equity section of our condensed consolidated balance sheets could be charged to our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 We continue to review our operations in Belarus including potential strategic alternatives. We have qualified third party vendors to supply components previously supplied from Belarus and have begun purchasing from them. Our Board of Directors monitors and continues to assess risks associated with our Belarusian operations.

 Supply chain and inventory balances . Because of disruptions to our supply chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine related sanctions, we increased our inventory safety stocks and placed non-cancellable orders for long lead time items. These caused our inventory levels and our days inventory on hand to increase. During the third quarter of 2024, we undertook an analysis of the safety stock and recorded additional provisions for excess inventory reserves of approximately 20.7 million. In addition, we recorded 8.8 million of inventory reserves related to inventory that became obsolete due to the launch of new components. 
 Net sales. Our net sales have historically fluctuated from quarter to quarter. The increase or decrease in sales from a prior quarter can be affected by the timing of orders received from customers, the timing of shipments, the mix of OEM orders and one-time orders for products with large purchase prices, competitive pressures, acquisitions, economic and political conditions in a certain country or region and seasonal factors such as the purchasing patterns and levels of activity throughout the year in the regions where we operate. Net sales can be affected by the time taken to qualify our products for use in new applications in the end markets that we serve. Our sales cycle varies substantially, ranging from a period of a few weeks to as long as one year or more, but is typically several months. The adoption of our products by a new customer or qualification in a new application can lead to an increase in net sales for a period, which may then slow until we penetrate new markets or obtain new customers. Foreign exchange rates also affect our net sales, due to changes in the U.S. dollar value of sales made in foreign currencies. 
 Our business depends substantially upon capital expenditures by end users, particularly by manufacturers using our products for materials processing, which includes general manufacturing, automotive including electric vehicles ("EV"), other transportation, aerospace, heavy industry, consumer, semiconductor and electronics. Approximately 89 of our revenues for the first three quarters of 2024, and 90 of the full fiscal year of 2023 were from customers using our products for materials processing. Although applications within materials processing are broad, the capital equipment market in general is cyclical and historically has experienced sudden and severe downturns. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon capital expenditures by end users of materials processing equipment and will be subject to the broader fluctuations of capital equipment spending. 
 In response to inflation in recent years, some global central banks have adopted less accommodating monetary policy and have increased benchmark interest rates in several major global economies. The increase in interest rates is intended to dampen demand that could lead to regional or global recession that may reduce demand for our products. In addition, an increase in interest rates would increase the cost of equipment financed with leases or debt. As we start to see inflation moderate in the second half of 2024, global central banks may adopt more accommodating monetary policy and reduce benchmark interest rates. 
 In recent years, our net sales and margins have been negatively impacted by tariffs and trade policy. New tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments. 
 We are also susceptible to global or regional disruptions such as political instability, geopolitical conflicts, acts of terrorism, significant fluctuations in currency values, natural disasters and pandemics to the extent that they affect macroeconomic conditions, global supply chains or individual IPG locations. 
 The average selling prices of our products generally decrease as the products mature. These decreases result from factors such as increased competition, decreased manufacturing costs and increased unit volumes. We may also reduce selling prices in order to penetrate new markets and applications. Furthermore, we may negotiate discounted selling prices from time to time with certain customers that place high unit-volume orders. 
 The secular shift to fiber laser technology in large materials processing applications, such as welding and cutting applications, had a positive effect on our sales trends in the past such that our sales trends were often better than other capital equipment manufacturers in both positive and negative economic cycles. As the secular shift to fiber laser technology matures in such applications, our sales trends are more susceptible to economic cycles, which can broadly affect the demand for capital equipment including machine tools and industrial lasers, and competition from other fiber laser manufacturers. 
 Gross margin. Our total gross margin in any period can be significantly affected by a number of factors, including net sales, production volumes, competitive factors, product mix, and by other factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, tariffs and shipping costs. Many of these factors are not under our control. The following are examples of factors affecting gross margin: 
 As our products mature, we can experience additional competition which tends to decrease average selling prices and affects gross margin; 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 Our gross margin can be significantly affected by product mix. Within each of our product categories, the gross margin is generally higher for devices with greater average power. These higher power products often have better performance, more difficult specifications to attain and fewer competing products in the marketplace; 
 Higher power lasers also use a greater number of optical components, improving absorption of fixed overhead costs and enabling economies of scale in manufacturing; 
 The gross margin for certain specialty products may be higher because there are fewer or sometimes no equivalent competing products; 
 Customers that purchase devices in greater unit volumes generally are provided lower prices per device than customers that purchase fewer units. In general, lower selling prices to high unit volume customers reduce gross margin although this may be partially offset by improved absorption of fixed overhead costs associated with larger product volumes, which drive economies of scale; 
 Gross margin on systems can be lower than gross margin for our lasers and sub-systems, depending on the configuration, volume and competitive forces, among other factors; 
 Persistent inflation leading to increases in average manufacturing salaries as well as an increase in the purchase price of components including, but not limited to, electronic components and metal parts could negatively impact gross margin if we are not able to pass those increases on to customers by increasing the selling price of our products; 
 Changes in relative exchange rates between currencies we receive when selling our products and currencies we use to pay our manufacturing expenses; and finally, 
 Our gross margin from products on new manufacturing lines can be lower due to production inefficiencies and high scrap costs. 
 We expect that some new technologies, products and systems will have returns above our cost of capital but may have gross margins below our corporate average. If we are able to develop opportunities that are significant in size, competitively advantageous or leverage our existing technology base and leadership, our current gross margin levels may not be maintained. Instead, we aim to deliver industry-leading levels of gross margins by growing sales, by taking market share in existing markets, or by developing new applications and markets we address, by reducing the cost of our products and by optimizing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations. 
 A high proportion of our costs is fixed so costs are generally difficult to adjust or may take time to adjust in response to changes in demand. In addition, our fixed costs increase as we expand our capacity. If we expand capacity faster than is required by sales growth, gross margins could be negatively affected. Gross margins generally decline if production volumes are lower as a result of a decrease in sales or a reduction in inventory because the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs will be reduced. Gross margins generally improve when the opposite occurs. If both sales and inventory decrease in the same period, the decline in gross margin may be greater if we cannot reduce fixed costs or choose not to reduce fixed costs to match the decrease in the level of production. If we experience a decline in sales that reduces absorption of our fixed costs, or if we have production issues, our gross margins will be negatively affected. 
 We also regularly review our inventory for items that are slow-moving, have been rendered obsolete or are determined to be excess. Any provision for such slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory affects our gross margins. For example, we recorded provisions for slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory totaling 43.4 million and 9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 70.3 million and 32.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded additional inventory provisions of 29.5 million attributed to items previously considered safety stock and items that became technologically obsolete. 
 Selling and general and administrative expenses. In the past, we invested in selling and general and administrative costs in order to support continued growth in the Company. As the secular shift to fiber laser technology matures, our sales growth becomes more susceptible to the cyclical trends typical of capital equipment manufacturers. Accordingly, our future management of and investments in selling and general and administrative expenses will also be influenced by these trends, although we may still invest in selling or general and administrative functions to support certain initiatives even in economic down cycles. Certain general and administrative expenses are not related to the level of sales and may vary quarter to quarter based primarily upon the level of acquisitions, litigation and project related consulting expenses. 
 Research and development expenses. We plan to continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing components and products and develop new components, products, systems and applications technology. We believe that these 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 investments will sustain our position as a leader in the fiber laser industry and will support development of new products that can address new markets and growth opportunities. The amount of research and development expense we incur may vary from period to period. 
 Goodwill and long-lived assets impairments . We review our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Negative industry or economic trends, including reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, lack of growth in our relevant business units, differences in the estimated product acceptance rates, or market prices below the carrying value of long-lived assets evaluated for sale could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. 
 As noted above, we recorded 26.6 million impairment of long-lived assets included in Impairment of long-lived assets in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. After impairment, the remaining carrying value of the long-lived assets in Belarus is 3.8 million. 
 Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance at many points during the analysis. Also, the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective. We operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. If our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations. 
 Foreign exchange. Because we are a U.S.-based company doing business globally, we have both translational and transactional exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the relative exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currencies in which our subsidiaries operate directly affects our sales, costs and earnings. Differences in the relative exchange rates between where we sell our products and where we incur manufacturing and other operating costs (primarily in the U.S. and Germany) also affects our costs and earnings. Certain currencies experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations like the euro, the Russian ruble, the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen have had and could have an additional significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the foreign exchange loss was primarily attributed to the appreciation of the euro as compared to the U.S. dollar. Our European subsidiaries have certain net assets denominated in U.S. dollars. Our ability to adjust the foreign currency selling prices of products in response to changes in exchange rates is limited and may not offset the impact of the changes in exchange rates on the translated value of sales or costs. In addition, if we increase the selling price of our products in local currencies, this could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. 
 Income taxes. We are evaluating the impact of countries adopting tax legislation in accordance with the proposals presented by the OECD (Pillars 1 and 2). Based on the current drafts of the proposals, the tax impact in most countries will not be significant in 2024 due to an effective tax rate in those countries in excess of 15 or as a result of the transition rules that are proposed. 
 Major customers. While we have historically depended on a few customers for a large percentage of our annual net sales, the composition of this group can change from period to period. Net sales derived from our five largest customers as a percentage of our net sales was 12 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 13 , and 15 for the full years 2023 and 2022, respectively. One of our customers accounted for 14 of our net accounts receivable as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We seek to add new customers and to expand our relationships with existing customers. We anticipate that the composition of our significant customers will continue to change. We generally do not enter into agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase a fixed number or large volume of our products. If any of our significant customers substantially reduced their purchases from us, our results would be adversely affected. 
 
 Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net sales. Net sales decreased by 68.3 million, or 22.6 , to 233.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 301.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Materials processing 
 Sales for materials processing applications decreased due to lower sales of high power CW lasers, medium power CW lasers, pulsed lasers, QCW lasers, laser and non-laser systems and other laser products and services. 
 High power CW laser sales decreased due to lower sales for cutting and welding applications. Within cutting applications, the decrease in sales was attributable to softer industrial demand primarily in Europe and the U.S., increased competition from Chinese fiber laser suppliers and inventory management by OEM customers, while welding applications were primarily impacted by a delay in e-mobility investments in China and soft general industrial demand in Europe. 
 Medium power CW laser sales decreased due to lower demand in welding, partially offset by an increase in 3D printing applications. 
 Pulsed laser sales, including high power pulsed lasers, decreased due to lower demand for foil cutting and cleaning and stripping applications. 
 QCW laser sales decreased due to lower demand in general industrial applications. 
 Laser and non-laser systems sales decreased, partially offset by higher demand for LightWELD systems. 
 Other Applications 
 Sales from other applications decreased due to decreased demand for lasers used in medical procedures and advanced applications. 
 Cost of sales and gross margin. Cost of sales increased by 10.6 million, or 6.3 , to 179.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 168.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross margin decreased to 23.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 44.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. For the three months 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 ended September 30, 2024, we recorded additional inventory provisions of 29.5 million attributed to items previously considered safety stock and items that became technologically obsolete. In addition to provisions for inventory reserves, gross margin declined due to an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing costs, partially offset by a decrease in shipping costs and tariffs, as a percentage of sales. 
 Sales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense were 22.2 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023. Increases in personnel and related expenses were fully offset by reductions in depreciation and amortization expense. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense increased to 9.5 from 7.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Research and development expense. Research and development expense increased by 2.5 million, or 10.1 , to 27.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to an increase in personnel and related expenses as well as an increase in premises expense. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense increased to 11.7 from 8.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased by 1.7 million, or 5.5 , to 32.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 31.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to increases in personnel and related expenses and bad debt provision. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense increased to 14.0 from 10.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Net loss from divestiture and sale of assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we divested our Russia operations for 51.1 million. The divestiture resulted in a loss of 197.7 million. 
 Impairment of long-lived assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we completed an impairment analysis of the assets in Belarus as a result of new EU sanctions that will limit our ability to supply laser cabinets and other mechanical components from our factory in Belarus. We recorded 26.6 million of impairment of long-lived assets. 
 Effect of exchange rates on net sales, gross profit and operating expenses. If exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as one year ago, which were on average euro 0.92, Russian ruble 94, Japanese yen 145 and Chinese yuan 7.24, respectively, we estimate that net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 would have been 0.5 million lower, gross profit would have been 0.7 million higher and total sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses would have been 0.1 million lower. 
 Loss on foreign exchange. We incurred a foreign exchange transaction loss of 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a 0.4 million gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our European subsidiaries have certain net assets denominated in U.S. dollars, and our Chinese subsidiary has certain net liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars. The foreign exchange loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an appreciation of the euro as compared to the U.S. dollar. 
 Interest income, net. Interest income, net was 11.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 11.6 million of income for three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in interest income, net was due to holding fewer short term investments in the current period as compared to the prior year. 
 Provision for income taxes . Provision for income taxes was 8.9 million benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.8 million expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rates were 3.7 and 18.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in tax expense was primarily due to a decrease of income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. There was a net discrete tax detriment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to 41.5 million losses not benefitted from the loss on divestiture of the Russian operations. The other discrete tax items for the three months ended September 30, 2024 did not have a significant effect on our tax rate. The discrete detriment for the three months ended September 30, 2023 did not have a significant effect on our tax rate. 
 Net (loss) income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation. Net (loss) income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation decreased by 288.6 million to a net loss of 233.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net income of 55.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the factors described above.

 Materials processing 
 Sales for materials processing applications decreased due to decreases in sales of high power CW lasers, medium power CW lasers, pulsed lasers, laser and non-laser systems and other laser products and service. 
 High power CW laser sales decreased due to lower sales for cutting and welding applications. Within cutting applications, the decrease in sales was attributable to softer industrial demand primarily in Europe and the U.S., increased competition from Chinese fiber laser suppliers and inventory management by OEM customers, while welding application was primarily impacted by a delay in e-mobility investments. 
 Medium power CW laser sales decreased due to a decrease in demand in welding, partially offset by growth in 3D printing applications. 
 Pulsed laser sales decreased due to lower demand in micro material processing applications and foil cutting applications. 
 Laser and non-laser systems sales decreased driven by lower demand for non-laser systems. 
 Other revenue for materials processing decreased due to lower sales of accessories and parts and service.

 Other Applications 
 Sales from other applications decreased due to decreased demand for lasers used in medical procedures and advanced applications. 
 Cost of sales and gross margin. Cost of sales decreased by 66.0 million, or 11.8 , to 495.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 561.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross margin decreased to 33.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 43.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin decreased mainly driven by increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded additional inventory provisions of 29.5 million attributed to items previously considered safety stock and items that became technologically obsolete. In addition to provisions for inventory reserves, gross margin declined due to an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing costs, partially offset by a decrease in shipping costs and tariffs, as a percentage of sales. 
 Sales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense increased by 4.2 million, or 6.6 , to 67.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 63.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to higher personnel and related expenses and premises expenses, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expenses. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense increased to 9.1 from 6.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Research and development expense. Research and development expense increased by 13.0 million, or 18.3 , to 84.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 71.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to higher personnel and related expenses and premises expenses. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense increased to 11.3 from 7.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased by 4.7 million, or 5.2 , to 95.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 90.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of increases in consultant, legal, and information system expenses. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense increased to 12.8 from 9.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Net loss from divestiture and sale of assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we incurred a net loss of 190.2 million. The loss was primarily related to the divestiture of our Russian operations for 197.7 million, partially offset by a gain on sale of assets of 7.5 million related to the sales of a building and land in the U.S. and a building in the U.K. 
 Impairment of long-lived assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed an impairment analysis of the assets in Belarus as a result of new EU sanctions that will limit our ability to supply laser cabinets and other mechanical components from our factory in Belarus. We recorded 26.6 million of impairment of long-lived asset. 
 Effect of exchange rates on net sales, gross profit and operating expenses. We estimate that, if exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as one year ago, which were on average euro 0.92, Russian ruble 83, Japanese yen 138 and Chinese yuan 7.03, respectively, we would have expected net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to be 13.2 million higher, gross profit to be 8.2 million higher and total sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses would have been 2.9 million higher. 
 Loss on foreign exchange. We incurred a foreign exchange transaction loss of 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a gain of 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our European subsidiaries have certain net assets denominated in U.S. dollars, and our Chinese subsidiary has certain net liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars. The loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to loss from the depreciation of the Chinese yuan for most of the year and appreciation of the euro, as compared to the U.S. dollar. 
 Interest income, net . Interest income, net, was 38.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 28.4 million of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income, net, was due to an increase in yields on cash equivalents and short-term investments that resulted from higher market interest rates as compared to prior year rates. 
 Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes was 5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 55.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There was tax expense provided on the Loss before provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The effective tax rate was 23.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in tax expense was primarily due to a decrease of income before provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . There was a tax detriment of 41.5 million primarily from the loss on divestiture of Russian operations for the nine months ended 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 September 30, 2024 . The other discrete tax items for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.4 million tax detriment primarily related to the increase in tax expense for equity-based compensation which was partially offset by the reductions in tax reserves. The discrete detriment for the nine months ended September 2023 did not have a significant effect on our tax rate. 
 Net (loss) income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation. Net (loss) income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation decreased by 366.8 million to a net loss of 189.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net income of 177.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the factors described above. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, our cash flows from operations and our existing lines of credit provide us with the financial flexibility to meet our liquidity and capital needs. We expect to continue making investments in capital expenditures, to assess acquisition opportunities and to repurchase shares of our stock in accordance with our repurchase program. The extent and timing of such expenditures may vary from period to period. Our future long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors including our level of sales, the impact of the economic environment on our growth, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, expansion of global sales and marketing activities, government regulation including trade sanctions, the timing and introductions of new products, the need to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the near term, we will incur capital expenditures related to the expansion of capacity outside of Russia and Belarus. As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 Included in cash and cash equivalents are 5.8 million of cash located in Belarus, as of September 30, 2024.

 (2) This facility is available to certain foreign subsidiaries in their respective local currencies. At September 30, 2024, there were no amounts drawn on this line; however, there were 1.6 million of guarantees issued against the line which reduces total availability. 
 (3) At September 30, 2024, there were no drawings. 
 At September 30, 2024, our committed credit line is with Bank of America N.A. in the amount of 75.0 million and it is not syndicated. We are required to meet certain financial covenants associated with this credit line. These covenants, tested quarterly, include an interest coverage ratio and a funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") ratio. The interest coverage covenant requires that we maintain a trailing twelve-month ratio of EBITDA to interest on all obligations that is at least 3.0:1.0. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated basis be less than three times our trailing twelve months EBITDA. Funded debt is decreased by our cash and available marketable securities not classified as long-term investments in the U.S.A. in excess of 50 million up to a maximum of 500 million. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The financial covenants in our loan documents may cause us to not make or to delay investments and actions that we might otherwise undertake because of limits on capital expenditures and amounts that we can borrow or lease. In the event that we do not comply with any one of these covenants, we would be in default under the loan agreement or loan agreements, which may result in acceleration of the debt, cross-defaults on other debt or a reduction in available liquidity, any of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. 
 See Note 10, "Financing Arrangements" in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information about our facilities. 
 The following table presents cash flow activities: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In thousands) Cash provided by operating activities 174,112 189,924 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 
 471,279 (162,996) Cash used in financing activities (284,609) (175,991) 
 Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 15.8 million to 174.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 189.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in sales, partially offset by an increase in cash provided by working capital. Our largest working capital items typically are inventory and accounts receivable. Items such as accounts payable to third parties, prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities are not as significant as our working capital investment in accounts receivable and inventory because of the amount of value added within IPG due to our vertically integrated structure. Accruals and payables for personnel costs including bonuses and income and other taxes payable are largely dependent on the timing of payments for those items. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities in 2024 primarily resulted from: 
 a decrease in cash provided by net income after adjusting for non-cash operating activities, mainly due to lower sales; and 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 an increase in cash used by income and other taxes payable due to the timing of estimated tax payments made and refunds received from filing tax returns, including an installment due on our transition tax liability from the Tax Reform Act of 2017. 
 The decreases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by: 
 an increase in cash provided by accounts receivable due to timing of collection and lower accounts receivable resulting from lower sales; 
 an increase in cash provided by inventory, as we moderate investment in safety stock related to supply chain disruptions for third party electronic parts and internally manufactured components and reduce inventory levels; 
 an increase in cash provided by accounts payable due to timing of payments; 
 a decrease in cash used by accrued expenses and other liabilities due to timing of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on custom systems and less cash used for personnel accruals, partially offset by an increase in cash used by customer deposits and deferred revenue due to lower sales; and 
 a decrease in cash used by prepaid expenses and other assets due to timing of bank acceptance drafts and costs and earnings in excess of billings on custom systems. 
 Investing activities. Net cash provided by investing activities was 471.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to cash used in investing activities of 163.0 million in 2023. The cash provided by investing activities in 2024 related to 543.0 million of net proceeds of short-term investments and 28.5 million of cash provided by sales of property, plant and equipment; partially offset by 75.4 million of cash used for capital expenditures, and 25.3 million of net cash outflow from the divestiture of our Russian operation. The cash proceeds from the sale of our Russian operation were lower than the cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in a cash outflow from divestiture. The cash used in investing activities in 2023 related to 108.6 million of net purchases of short-term investments and 85.3 million of cash used for capital expenditures; partially offset by 30.4 million of cash provided by sales of property, plant and equipment. 
 In 2024, we expect to invest approximately 100 million net of proceeds from sale of fixed assets. Capital expenditures include investments in property, facilities and equipment to replace capacity in Russia and upgrade or replace equipment at other facilities that is beyond its useful life. Capital expenditures also include investments to increase vertical integration, increase redundant manufacturing capacity for critical components and enhance research and development capabilities. The timing and extent of any capital expenditures in and between periods can have a significant effect on our cash flow. If we obtain financing for certain projects, our cash expenditures would be reduced in the year of expenditure. Many of the capital expenditure projects that we undertake have long lead times and are difficult to cancel or defer to a later period. We intend to finance our capital expenditures with existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments as well as with cash generated from operations. 
 Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was 284.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net cash used of 176.0 million in 2023. The cash used in financing activities in 2024 primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock of 286.5 million. The cash used in financing activities in 2023 primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock of 159.5 million and principal payments on our long-term borrowings of 16.0 million.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption or expected adoption and effects on our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business, which consists primarily of interest rate risk associated with our cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange rate risk. 
 Interest rate risk . Certain interest rates are variable and fluctuate with current market conditions. Our investments have limited exposure to market risk. We maintain a portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consisting primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds and U.S treasury and agency obligations. None of these investments have a maturity date in excess of one year. Because of the short-term nature of these instruments, a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 We are also exposed to market risk as a result of increases or decreases in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our borrowings on our bank credit facilities. Although our U.S. revolving line of credit have variable rates, we do not believe that a 10 change in market interest rates would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
 Exchange rates. Due to our international operations, a significant portion of our net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the euro, the Russian ruble, and the Chinese yuan. Changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar versus the functional currencies of our subsidiaries affect the translated value and relative level of sales and net income that we report from one period to the next. In addition, our subsidiaries may have assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency which results in foreign exchange transaction gains and losses due to changes in the value of the functional currency versus the currency the assets and liabilities are denominated in. The loss on foreign exchange transactions totaled 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a gain of 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Management attempts to minimize these exposures by partially or fully off-setting foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at our subsidiaries that operate in different functional currencies. The effectiveness of this strategy can be limited by the volume of underlying transactions at various subsidiaries and by our ability to accelerate or delay inter-company cash settlements. As a result, we are unable to create a perfect offset of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. As a result of the divestiture of our Russian operation, our exposure to the Russian ruble in future periods is not expected to be significant. 
 At September 30, 2024, our material foreign currency exposure is net U.S. dollar denominated assets at subsidiaries where the euro is the functional currency and U.S. dollar denominated liabilities where the Chinese yuan is the functional currency. The net U.S. dollar denominated assets are comprised of cash, third party receivables and inter-company receivables offset by third party and inter-company payables denominated in U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar denominated liabilities are comprised of inter-company payables. A 5 change in the relative exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the euro as of September 30, 2024 applied to the net U.S. dollar asset balances, would result in a foreign exchange gain of 3.7 million if the U.S. dollar appreciated and a 3.9 million foreign exchange loss if the U.S. dollar depreciated. A 5 change in the relative exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Chinese yuan as of September 30, 2024 applied to the net U.S. dollar liabilities balances, would result in a foreign exchange loss of 0.8 million if the U.S. dollar appreciated and a 0.8 million foreign exchange gain if the U.S. dollar depreciated. 
 In addition, we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk for those subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar as changes in the value of their functional currency relative to the U.S. dollar affect the translated amounts of our assets and liabilities. Changes in the translated value of assets and liabilities due to changes in functional currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar result in foreign currency translation adjustments that are a component of other comprehensive income or loss on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
 Foreign currency derivative instruments can also be used to hedge exposures and reduce the risks of certain foreign currency transactions; however, these instruments provide only limited protection and can carry significant cost. We have no foreign currency derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024. We will continue to analyze our exposure to currency

 exchange rate fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the "Evaluation Date"). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
