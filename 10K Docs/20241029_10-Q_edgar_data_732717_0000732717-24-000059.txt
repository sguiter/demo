reportable segments: Communications and Latin America. 
 
 We also evaluate segment and business unit performance based on EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin, which is defined as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used as part of our management reporting and we believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it measures the cash generation potential of our business units. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by total revenue. 
 
 The Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our business strategies reflect integrated product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. This segment contains the following business units: 
 Mobility provides nationwide wireless service and equipment. 
 Business Wireline provides advanced ethernet-based fiber services, IP Voice and managed professional services, as well as traditional voice and data services and related equipment to business customers. In the first quarter of 2024, we began

 Contract Assets and Liabilities 
 A contract asset is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of our right to bill and receive consideration. The contract asset will decrease as services are provided and billed. For example, when installment sales include promotional discounts (e.g., trade-in device credits) the difference between revenue recognized and consideration received is recorded as a contract asset to be amortized over the contract term. 
 
 Our contract assets primarily relate to our wireless businesses. Promotional equipment sales where we offer handset credits, which are allocated between equipment and service in proportion to their standalone selling prices, when customers commit to a

 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 Remaining performance obligations represent services we are required to provide to customers under bundled or discounted arrangements, which are satisfied as services are provided over the contract term. In determining the transaction price allocated, we do not include non-recurring charges and estimates for usage, nor do we consider arrangements with an original expected duration of less than one year, which are primarily prepaid wireless and residential internet agreements. 
 
 Remaining performance obligations associated with business contracts reflect recurring charges billed, adjusted to reflect estimates for sales incentives and revenue adjustments. Performance obligations associated with wireless contracts are estimated using a portfolio approach in which we review all relevant promotional activities, calculating the remaining performance obligation using the average service component for the portfolio and the average device price. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was , of which we expect to recognize approximately by the end of 2025, with the balance recognized thereafter.

 Our cash equivalents (money market securities) and short-term investments (certificate and time deposits) are recorded at amortized cost, and the respective carrying amounts approximate fair values. Short-term investments are recorded in Prepaid and other current assets and our investment securities are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 We enter into derivative transactions to manage certain market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. This includes the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign exchange forward contracts and combined interest rate foreign exchange contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield curves and foreign exchange rates (all of our derivatives are Level 2). Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedged. 
 
 Fair Value Hedging Periodically, we enter into and designate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount. 
 
 We also designate most of our cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange contracts as fair value hedges. The purpose of these contracts is to hedge foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign denominated debt. For cross-currency hedges, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the swap related to both time value and cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For foreign exchange contracts, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
 
 Unrealized and realized gains or losses from fair value hedges impact the same category on the consolidated statements of income as the item being hedged, including the earnings impact of excluded components. In instances where we have elected to exclude components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to fair value hedges, unrealized gains or losses on such excluded components are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI and recognized into earnings over the life of the hedging instrument. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recorded at fair market value as liabilities. Except for excluded components, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities through earnings. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no ineffectiveness was measured on fair value hedges.

Equipment Installment Receivables Program 
 We offer our customers the option to purchase certain wireless devices in installments over a specified period of time and, in many cases, once certain conditions are met, they may be eligible to trade in the original equipment for a new device and have the remaining unpaid balance paid or settled. 
 
 We maintain a program under which we transfer a portion of these receivables through our bankruptcy-remote subsidiary in exchange for cash and beneficial interests. In the event a customer trades in a device prior to the end of the installment contract period, we agree to make a payment to the financial institutions equal to any outstanding remaining installment receivable balance. Accordingly, we record a guarantee obligation for this estimated amount at the time the receivables are transferred.

Beneficial interests, when applicable, and guarantee obligations are initially recorded at estimated fair value and subsequently adjusted for changes in present value of expected cash flows. The estimation of their fair values is based on remaining installment payments expected to be collected and the expected timing and value of device trade-ins. The estimated value of the device trade-ins considers prices offered to us by independent third parties and contemplates changes in value after the launch of a device model. The fair value measurements used for the beneficial interests and the guarantee obligation are considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 7).

 Revolving Receivables Program 
 During 2024, we expanded our revolving agreement to transfer up to of certain receivables through our bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries to various financial institutions on a recurring basis in exchange for cash equal to the gross receivables transferred. This agreement is subject to renewal on an annual basis and the transfer limit may be expanded or reduced from time to time. As customers pay their balances, we transfer additional receivables into the program, resulting in our gross receivables sold exceeding net cash flow impacts (e.g., collect and reinvest). The transferred receivables are fully guaranteed by our bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries, which hold additional receivables in the amount of that are pledged as collateral under this agreement. The transfers are recorded at fair value of the proceeds received and obligations assumed less derecognized receivables. Our maximum exposure to loss related to these receivables transferred is limited to the derecognized amount outstanding.

Preferred Interests Issued by Subsidiaries 
 Tower Holdings Preferred Interests 
 In 2019, we issued nonconvertible cumulative preferred interest in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and has the right to receive approximately if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised. 
 
 The membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the 2019 Tower preferred interests ). The September series (Tower Class A-1) of the preferred interests totals and pays an initial preferred distribution of , and the December series (Tower Class A-2) totals and pays an initial preferred distribution of . Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration and reset every . 
 
 In August 2024, we amended the 2019 Tower preferred interests, effective November 2024, to reset the rate and restructure the membership interests whereby all of the 2019 Tower preferred interests shall be designated Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Fixed Rate Interests). A portion of the Tower Fixed Rate Interests will move to Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Floating Rate Interests) each year over a five-year period. The Tower Fixed Rate Interests pay a preferred distribution of , and the Tower Floating Rate Interests pay a preferred distribution equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus basis points, as defined in the agreement. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower Fixed Rate Interests or Tower Floating Rate Interests (collectively, the Tower preferred interests would not impose any limitation on cash movement between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT T shares. We can call the Tower Fixed Rate Interests at the issue price beginning in November 2029, and we can call the Tower Floating Rate Interests at any time. The Tower preferred interests are included in Noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheets.

If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the Tower preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes. 
 
 Telco LLC Preferred Interests 
 At September 30, 2024, and as of the date of this report, we had outstanding cumulative preferred interests in a limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunication-related assets. The cumulative preferred interests in Telco LLC are comprised of Telco Class A-1, A-2 and A-3 interests (collectively the Telco preferred interests and are included in Noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 16 to AT T s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K). The Telco preferred interests can be called at issue price beginning September 29, 2027. The holders of the Telco preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of Telco LLC to pay the preferred distribution for or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of members equity are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the Telco preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes. 
 
 In October 2024, we entered into an agreement to issue in the first quarter of 2025, an additional of nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in Telco LLC (Telco Class A-4). The Telco Class A-4 interests will pay an initial preferred distribution of annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset on November 1, 2028, and every thereafter. The Telco Class A-4 interests can be called at issue price beginning November 1, 2028, and are subject to the same redemption and liquidation rights as the Telco Class A-1, A-2 and A-3 interests. Upon the expected issuance in the first quarter of 2025, we intend to use the Telco Class A-4 proceeds to fund the redemption of preferred equity securities.

 Operating revenues decreased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, reflecting declines in Business Wireline service and Mobility equipment revenues, partially offset by Mobility service, Consumer Wireline and Mexico revenues . 
 
 Operations and support expenses increased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to a 4,422 noncash goodwill impairment. We performed an interim goodwill impairment test of the Business Wireline reporting unit and concluded that the calculated fair value was lower than the book value, which was driven by a faster-than-previously anticipated industry-wide secular decline of legacy services (see Note 1). The increases were partially offset by lower Mobility equipment costs resulting from lower wireless sales volumes and expense declines from our continued transformation efforts. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to the shortening of estimated economic lives of wireless network equipment that will be replaced earlier than originally anticipated with our Open RAN network modernization efforts. Also contributing to higher depreciation expense was the impact of ongoing capital spending for strategic initiatives such as fiber and network upgrades. 
 
 Operating income decreased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024. Our operating income margin in the third quarter decreased from 19.1 in 2023 to 7.0 in 2024 and for the first nine months decreased from 20.1 in 2023 to 15.2 in 2024. 
 
 Interest expense increased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to lower capitalized interest associated with spectrum acquisitions, mostly offset by lower debt balances. Interest expense for the first nine months of 2023 also included distributions on Mobility preferred interests, which were repurchased on April 5, 2023.

Equity in net income of affiliates decreased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to the performance of our investment in DIRECTV, which included our share of a gain on a sale-leaseback transaction by DIRECTV of approximately 100 in the first quarter of 2023 (see Note 9). 
 
 Other income (expense) net increased in the third quarter and decreased for the first nine months of 2024. The increase in the third quarter was primarily the result of a prior-year write-down of our SKY Mexico equity investment and higher returns on other benefit-related investments. These increases were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement benefit credits and an actuarial gain on our pension plan in 2023 with no corresponding remeasurement in 2024. 
 
 The decrease for the first nine months was primarily driven by lower pension and postretirement benefit credits in 2024 and net actuarial and settlement gains in 2023 with no corresponding remeasurement in 2024 (see Note 6) and an impairment recognized on a held-for-sale business, partially offset by the prior-year write-down of our SKY Mexico equity investment and higher returns on other benefit-related investments. 
 
 Income tax expense increased in the third quarter and decreased for the first nine months of 2024. The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to a higher effective tax rate driven by a goodwill impairment (see Note 1), which is not deductible for tax purposes. The decrease for the first nine months was primarily due to lower income before income tax. 
 
 Our effective tax rate was 89.9 in the third quarter of 2024 and 31.1 for the first nine months of 2024, versus 23.2 and 22.9 in the comparable periods in the prior year. The increase in our effective tax rates were primarily due to the goodwill impairment, which is not deductible for tax purposes.

Operating revenues decreased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, primarily driven by declines in our Business Wireline business unit, which reflects lower demand for legacy services and product simplification, as well as the absence of revenues from our cybersecurity business that was contributed to a new cybersecurity joint venture, LevelBlue, in the second quarter of 2024. Revenue declines were also driven by lower Mobility equipment revenue. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our Mobility and Consumer Wireline business units, driven by gains in wireless and broadband services. 
 
 Operating income decreased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024. Our Communications segment operating income margin in the third quarter decreased from 24.9 in 2023 to 24.6 in 2024 and for the first nine months decreased from 24.3 in 2023 to 24.2 in 2024.

Tablet net adds (losses) were (21) and (36) for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and 31 and (85) for the first nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Wearables and other net adds were 47 and 118 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and 209 and 423 for the first nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 3 Calculated by dividing the aggregate number of wireless subscribers who canceled service during a month by the total number of wireless subscribers at the beginning of that month. The churn rate for the period is equal to the average of the churn rate for each month of that period. 

Service revenue increased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024. The increases are largely due to growth from subscriber gains and postpaid phone average revenue per subscriber (ARPU) growth. As part of our transformation activities and our focus on simplification, we aligned the timing of certain administrative fees and recorded approximately 90 of one-time revenues in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 ARPU 
 ARPU increased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, reflecting pricing actions. 
 
 Churn 
 The effective management of subscriber churn is critical to our ability to maximize revenue growth and to maintain and improve margins. Postpaid churn and postpaid phone-only churn were lower in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Equipment revenue decreased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, primarily driven by lower wireless device sales volumes. 
 
 Operations and support expenses decreased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to lower equipment costs driven by lower wireless sales volumes. 
 
 Depreciation expense increased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to shortening of estimated economic lives of wireless equipment that will be replaced earlier than originally anticipated with our Open RAN deployment and network transformation, and ongoing capital spending for network upgrades and expansion, which we expect to continue through the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Operating income increased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024. Our Mobility operating income margin in the third quarter increased from 32.7 in 2023 to 33.3 in 2024 and for the first nine months increased from 31.9 in 2023 to 32.5 in 2024. Our Mobility EBITDA margin in the third quarter increased from 43.0 in 2023 to 45.1 in 2024 and for the first nine months increased from 42.2 in 2023 to 44.5 in 2024. EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization.

 Service revenues decreased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, driven by lower demand for legacy voice, data and network services along with product simplification, partially offset by growth in connectivity services. We expect these trends to continue. Revenue declines also were impacted by prior-year intellectual property sales of approximately 100 and the absence of revenues from our cybersecurity business that was contributed to LevelBlue. 
 
 Equipment revenues increased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, driven by higher customer premises equipment sales, which are nonrecurring in nature. 
 
 Operations and support expenses decreased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, primarily driven by lower personnel costs associated with ongoing transformation initiatives, lower network access and customer support expenses and the contribution of our cybersecurity business. Partially offsetting the decreases for the first nine months were higher vendor credits in 2023 and higher equipment costs in 2024. As part of our transformation activities, we expect operations and support expense improvements through the remainder of 2024 as we further right size our operations in alignment with the strategic direction of the business. 
 
 Depreciation expense increased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to ongoing capital investment for strategic initiatives such as fiber, which we expect to continue through the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Operating income decreased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024. Our Business Wireline operating income margin in the third quarter decreased from 6.7 in 2023 to (0.9) in 2024 and for the first nine months decreased from 7.1 in 2023 to 0.9 in 2024. Our Business Wireline EBITDA margin in the third quarter decreased from 32.5 in 2023 to 29.4 in 2024 and for the first nine months decreased from 32.4 in 2023 to 29.9 in 2024.

Other service and equipment revenues decreased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, reflecting the continued decline in the number of VoIP customers. 
 
 Operations and support expenses decreased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024. The expense decrease in the third quarter was primarily driven by lower customer support costs and network-related costs, partially offset by higher marketing expense. The expense decrease for the first nine months was driven by lower customer support costs and operating taxes that were offset by higher network-related costs as our fiber build scales.

 Service revenues decreased in the third quarter and increased for the first nine months of 2024. The decrease in the third quarter was primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by growth in subscribers and ARPU. The increase for the first nine months reflects growth in subscribers and favorable exchange rates primarily from the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Equipment revenues increased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024. The increase in the third quarter was primarily driven by higher equipment sales, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. The increase for the first nine months was primarily driven by higher equipment sales and favorable exchange rates primarily from the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Operations and support expenses increased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to increased equipment and selling costs resulting from higher sales. Foreign exchange impacts were favorable in the third quarter and unfavorable for the first nine months. Approximately 4 of Mexico expenses are U.S. dollar based, with the remainder in the local currency. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024, primarily driven by lower in-service assets. Foreign exchange impacts were favorable in the third quarter and unfavorable for the first nine months. 
 
 Operating income improved in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024. Our Mexico operating income margin in the third quarter increased from (2.9) in 2023 to 1.0 in 2024 and for the first nine months increased from (3.4) in 2023 to 0.6 in 2024. Our Mexico EBITDA margin in the third quarter increased from 15.6 in 2023 to 16.4 in 2024 and for the first nine months increased from 15.7 in 2023 to 16.5 in 2024. 

COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
 
 Overview AT T subsidiaries operating within the United States are subject to federal and state regulatory authorities. AT T subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the markets where service is provided. 
 
 In the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Telecom Act), Congress established a national policy framework intended to bring the benefits of competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition and reducing or eliminating regulatory burdens that harm consumer welfare. Nonetheless, since then, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions have maintained, re-imposed or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies. Recently, the FCC s regulatory approach has depended on control of the executive branch, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations in a number of areas, while imposing or re-imposing regulations in other areas. We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts, at both the state and federal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition. 
 
 Until 2015, the FCC classified fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as information services subject to minimal regulation. In 2015, the FCC reclassified such services as telecommunications services subject to broader regulation by 
 37 

AT T INC. 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 
 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Continued 
 Dollars in millions except per share amounts 

the FCC and imposed net neutrality rules. Since then, the FCC has twice reversed course, most recently again reclassifying such services as telecommunications services subject to broader regulation by the FCC in an order adopted on April 25, 2024. Multiple trade associations and other parties have challenged the FCC s reclassification decision in appeals consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The trade associations have petitioned the Sixth Circuit to stay the FCC s order. On August 1, 2024, the Sixth Circuit issued a stay of the FCC order pending review of the appeals, holding that broadband providers are likely to succeed on the merits. The appeals are now being briefed, with oral argument scheduled for October 31, 2024. 
 
 Since 2018, some states have adopted legislation or issued executive orders that established state net neutrality rules, including California and Vermont. We expect additional states may seek to impose net neutrality and other requirements on broadband in the future. 
 
 On November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) was signed into law. The legislation appropriates 65,000 to support broadband deployment and adoption. The National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA) is responsible for distributing more than 48,000 of this funding, including 42,500 in state grants for broadband deployment projects in unserved and underserved areas through the Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Programs. NTIA and states are in the process of administering these grants. Where appropriate, AT T has applied for, and in some cases has been awarded, and may continue to apply for grants under this or other government infrastructure programs. The IIJA also appropriated 14,200 for establishment of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), an FCC-administered monthly, low-income broadband benefit program, in which AT T participated. The ACP ended earlier this year. 
 
 On November 15, 2023, the FCC adopted rules to facilitate equal access to broadband and prevent digital discrimination in broadband access. The rules, which became effective March 22, 2024, prohibit covered entities from implementing policies or practices not justified by genuine issues of technical or economic feasibility, that differentially impact consumers access to broadband internet access service based on prohibited characteristics (including income level, race, and ethnicity) or that have such differential impact, whether intentional or not. The rules broadly apply prospectively to all aspects of an ISP s service that could impact a consumer s ability to access broadband, including deployment, marketing, and credit checks, among other things. We may be required to answer complaints alleging that the company has violated the FCC rules and those complaints may seek relief, including changes to our business practices or civil forfeitures that could result in significant costs or reputational harm. It is currently uncertain how the FCC will implement and enforce these new rules. Several business and consumer-oriented associations have filed appeals challenging the rules and those appeals have been consolidated in the Eighth Circuit, which held oral argument on September 25, 2024. 
 
 Privacy-related legislation continues to be adopted or considered in a number of jurisdictions. Legislative, regulatory and litigation actions could result in increased costs of compliance, further regulation or claims against broadband internet access service providers and others, and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data. 
 
 During 2020-2021, we deployed 5G nationwide on low band spectrum on macro towers. Executing on recent spectrum purchases, we announced ongoing construction and continuing deployment of 5G on 3.45 GHz and C-band spectrum in 2022 and beyond. Additional spectrum will be needed industrywide for 5G and future services. In 2023, the federal government released a national spectrum strategy that focused on spectrum sharing but did not include specific timelines to make additional spectrum bands available for 5G and future generations of service. As a result, the federal government s ability and intent to make sufficient spectrum available to the industry in needed timeframes remains uncertain.

 We had 2,586 in cash and cash equivalents available at September 30, 2024, decreasing 4,136 since December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents included cash of 1,062 and money market funds and other cash equivalents of 1,524. Approximately 965 of our cash and cash equivalents were held in accounts outside of the U.S. and may be subject to restrictions on repatriation. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, cash inflows were primarily provided by cash receipts from operations, including cash from our sale and transfer of our receivables to third parties and distributions from DIRECTV. These inflows were exceeded by cash used to meet the needs of the business, including, but not limited to, payment of operating expenses. The cash generated from operating activities was used to repay short-term borrowings and long-term debt, funding capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, and dividend payments to stockholders. We maintain availability under our credit facilities and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. 
 
 Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 During the first nine months of 2024, cash provided by operating activities was 26,875, compared to 26,936 for the first nine months of 2023, reflecting the timing of working capital associated with device payments, as well as the expansion of committed, cost-efficient receivable sales programs in 2024, offset by operational growth. 
 
 We actively manage the timing of our supplier payments for operating items to optimize the use of our cash. Among other things, we seek to make payments on 90-day or greater terms, while providing the suppliers with access to bank facilities that permit earlier payments at their cost (referred to as supplier financing program). In addition, for payments to suppliers of handset inventory, as part of our working capital initiatives, we have arrangements that allow us to extend the stated payment terms by up to 90 days at an additional cost to us (referred to as direct supplier financing). The net impact of direct supplier financing, including principal and interest payments, was to decrease cash from operating activities approximately 3,648 and 3,054 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. All supplier financing payments are due within one year. (See Note 10) 
 
 Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 For the first nine months of 2024, cash used in investing activities totaled 12,127 and consisted primarily of 13,420 (including interest during construction) for capital expenditures. During the first nine months of 2024, we also paid 457 in cash on FirstNet sustainability payment. During the first nine months of 2024, we received a return of investment of 928 from DIRECTV representing distributions in excess of cumulative equity in earnings from DIRECTV (see Note 9). 
 
 For capital improvements, we have negotiated favorable vendor payment terms of 120 days or more (referred to as vendor financing) with some of our vendors, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. For the first nine months of 2024, vendor financing payments were 1,571, compared to 4,736 for the first nine months of 2023. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2024 were 13,420, and when including 1,571 cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was 14,991 2,997 lower than the prior-year comparable period). 
 
 The vast majority of our capital expenditures are spent on our networks, including product development and related support systems. During the first nine months of 2024, we placed 581 of productive assets (primarily software) in service under vendor 
 39

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Continued 
 Dollars in millions except per share amounts 

financing arrangements (compared to 2,128 in the prior-year comparable period). The amount of capital expenditures is influenced by demand for services and products, capacity needs and network enhancements. 
 
 Cash Provided by or Used in Financing Activities 
 For the first nine months of 2024, cash used in financing activities totaled 18,855 and was primarily comprised of debt repayments, payments of dividends and vendor financing payments. 
 
 A tabular summary of our debt activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows: 
 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Net commercial paper borrowings 428 262 (2,686) (1,996) Repayments USD notes (2,300) (1,615) (3,915) EUR notes

 The weighted average interest rate of our long-term debt portfolio, including credit agreement borrowings and the impact of derivatives, was approximately 4.2 as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023. We had 127,501 of total notes and debentures outstanding at September 30, 2024. This also included Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, and Australian dollar denominated debt that totaled approximately 33,477. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 2,637 of long-term debt maturing within one year. We had no outstanding commercial paper or other short-term borrowings on September 30, 2024. The weighted average interest rate on our outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 6.0 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, we paid 1,571 of cash under our vendor financing program, compared to 4,736 in the prior-year comparable period. Total vendor financing payables included in our September 30, 2024 consolidated balance sheet were 1,660, with 843 due within one year (in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the remainder predominantly due within five years (in Other noncurrent liabilities ). 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 144 million shares remaining from our share repurchase authorizations approved by the Board of Directors in 2014. 
 
 We paid dividends on common and preferred shares of 6,171 during the first nine months of 2024, compared with 6,116 for the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Dividends on common stock declared by our Board of Directors totaled 0.8325 per share in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. Our dividend policy considers the expectations and requirements of stockholders, capital funding requirements of AT T and long-term growth opportunities. 
 
 Credit Facilities 
 The following summary of our various credit and loan agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to each agreement filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 We use credit facilities as a tool in managing our liquidity status. We currently have one 12,000 revolving credit agreement that terminates on November 18, 2028 (Revolving Credit Agreement). No amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We also utilize other external financing sources, which include various credit arrangements supported by government agencies to support network equipment purchases as well as a commercial paper program.

AT T INC. 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 
 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Continued 
 Dollars in millions except per share amounts 

Our Revolving Credit Agreement contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with investment grade senior debt credit rating as well as a net debt-to-EBITDA financial ratio covenant requiring AT T to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of not more than 3.75-to-1. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants for our credit facilities. 
 
 Collateral Arrangements 
 Most of our counterparty collateral arrangements require cash collateral posting by AT T only when derivative market values exceed certain thresholds. Under these arrangements, which cover the majority of our approximate 35,400 derivative portfolio, counterparties are still required to post collateral. During the first nine months of 2024, we posted 3 of cash collateral, on a net basis. Cash postings under these arrangements vary with changes in credit ratings and netting agreements. (See Note 7) 
 
 Other 
 Our total capital consists of debt (long-term debt and debt maturing within one year), redeemable noncontrolling interest and stockholders equity. Our capital structure does not include debt issued by our equity method investments. At September 30, 2024, our debt ratio was 52.2 , compared to 53.5 at September 30, 2023 and 53.5 at December 31, 2023. The debt ratio is affected by the same factors that affect total capital, and reflects our recent debt issuances, repayments and reclassifications related to redemption of noncontrolling interests. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had no interest rate swaps. 
 
 We have fixed-to-fixed and floating-to-fixed cross-currency swaps on foreign currency-denominated debt instruments with a U.S. dollar notional value of 35,351 to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. These derivatives have been designated as cash flow or fair value hedges with a net fair value of (2,732) at September 30, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 The registrant maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrant is recorded, processed, summarized, accumulated and communicated to its management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, except to the extent awarded by a court to a third party pursuant to a Third Party Claim, no Indemnifying Party shall have any liability for any (i) consequential, indirect, speculative or incidental damages (except, in each case, to the extent such damages are reasonably foreseeable at the time that the applicable action was taken) or (ii) punitive or exemplary damages. The amount of any Losses shall be net of any Tax benefit arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Losses (determined on a with and without basis), which Tax benefit is realized by Buyer or Blocker in cash or as a reduction to cash Tax liabilities (x) in the taxable year in which such Losses are incurred (y) in any prior taxable year, as a result of the carryback of such Losses, or (z) in the subsequent taxable year. 
 42 

(b) Insurance . Subject to Exhibit C , in calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates (net of Taxes (other than Income Taxes) and other costs associated with the receipt or recovery of such amounts under any insurance policy, increases in insurance premiums and reasonable out-of-pocket legal fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party), or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person, in each case to the extent relating to the matters described in the Claim Notice, shall be deducted, except to the extent that the adjustment itself would excuse, exclude or limit the coverage of all or part of such Loss. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover any such insurance proceeds to the same extent such Indemnified Party would recover such proceeds if such Losses were not subject to indemnification hereunder. 
 (c) Reserved . 
 (d) Purchase Price Adjustment . No Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be indemnified, defended, held harmless or reimbursed for, from or against any Losses to the extent such Losses are included in the calculation of the Final Upfront Consideration or the Final Blocker Liability Amount pursuant to Section 2.3 . 
 (e) Reimbursement . If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third party in respect of a Loss after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII , the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount received from the third party in respect thereof (the Total Recovered Amount ), less (ii) the full amount of the Loss, less (iii) any reasonable out-of-pocket legal fees, Taxes, increases in premiums, costs and expenses actually incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party in connection with recovering the amount received from the third party. Where the Total Recovered Amount does not allow the Indemnified Party to recover the full amount of the Loss, the Indemnified Party has no obligation to remit to the Indemnifying Party any amount pursuant to this Section 8.5(e) unless and until the Indemnified Party has recovered the full amount of the relevant Loss. 
 (f) No Double Recovery . No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover more than once in respect of the same Loss (notwithstanding that such Loss may result from more than one of the occurrences specified in Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 , as the case may be). 
 Section VIII.6 Payments . The exclusive remedy for any Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are indemnified under Section 8.2 shall be in the form of a payment from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party in the amount of any Loss for which it is liable hereunder, in immediately available funds, to an account specified by the Indemnified Party no later than five Business Days following any Final Determination of the claims set forth in the related Claim Notice. The exclusive remedy for any Losses for which the AT&T Indemnified Parties are indemnified under Section 8.3 shall be in the form of a payment from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party in the amount of any Loss for which it is liable hereunder, in immediately available funds, to an account specified by the Indemnified Party no later than five Business Days following any Final Determination of the claims set forth in the 
 43 

related Claim Notice. Except as otherwise set forth herein, each Party, on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby waives any rights of set-off, netting, offset, recoupment or similar rights that such Party or its Affiliates may have with respect to any amounts owed under this ARTICLE VIII against any other amounts owed under this Agreement. All payments made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 shall be treated as adjustments to the consideration paid pursuant to the Transactions for Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by Law. 
 Section VIII.7 Exclusive Remedies and No Rights Against Nonparties . 
 (a) Following the Closing, no Party shall assert against any other Party any claim, cause of action, right or remedy, or any Action, relating to this Agreement, the Transactions or any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith, other than (i) as set forth in Section 2.3(c) , (ii) claims pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII , (iii) claims for Fraud, (iv) claims pursuant to Section 10.9 Section 10.9(d) Specific Performance with respect to covenants to be performed at or following the Closing, and (v) claims pursuant to the terms of any other Transaction Document as permitted thereunder provided , that the foregoing limitations on the remedies of a Party will not apply to claims based upon Fraud. Following the Closing, the claims and remedies specified in clauses (i) through (v) of the previous sentence shall constitute the Parties sole and exclusive rights and remedies available to the Indemnified Parties for all Losses or other claims relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transactions and any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith, and shall supersede all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity (including any right of rescission). Accordingly, effective as of the Closing, each Party hereby irrevocably waives and discharges, and releases each other Party, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, from, all other claims, causes of action and Actions relating thereto. 
 (b) In addition to Section 8.7(a) , this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Action, right or remedy that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or the Transactions, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be made against the Persons that are expressly identified as Parties in their capacities as parties to this Agreement, and no Party shall at any time assert against any Person (other than a Party) which is a director, officer, employee, stockholder, general or limited partner, member, manager, agent or Affiliate or representative of, or Debt Financing Source to, another Party (each, a Nonparty ), any claim, cause of action, right or remedy, or any Action, relating to this Agreement, any other Transaction Document, the Transactions or any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith other than for Fraud. Each Party hereby waives and discharges any such claim, cause of action, right, remedy and Action, and releases (and agrees to execute and deliver any instrument necessary to effectuate the release of) each Nonparty therefrom other than for Fraud. The provisions of this Section 8.7(b) are for the benefit of and shall be enforceable by each Nonparty, which is an intended third party beneficiary of this Section 8.7(b) and Section 6.14 in connection herewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.7 , in no event shall the foregoing be construed to waive any claim of the Company against the Debt Financing Sources pursuant to the transactions contemplated thereunder. 
 44 

Section VIII.8 Tax Treatment . The Parties intend for any payments made under Section 2.3 or this Article VIII to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all U.S. federal (and applicable state, local and non-U.S.) Tax purposes to the maximum extent permitted by Law.

 (d) by Buyer, if AT&T shall have breached or failed to perform, as applicable, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of AT&T set forth in this Agreement (including an obligation to consummate the Transactions), which breach or failure to perform (i) if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 , and (ii) is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier of (A) 30 days after written notice thereof is given by Buyer to AT&T and (B) the Outside Date provided , that Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) if Buyer is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,

 (a) This Agreement, and all Actions (whether in contract, tort or statute) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by, and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, including its statutes of limitations, without giving effect to any borrowing statute or applicable principles of conflicts of law to the extent that the application of the laws (including statutes of limitation) of another jurisdiction (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) would be required thereby. 
 (b) Each Party agrees that it shall bring any Action in respect of any claim based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or if such court does not have jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court (the Chosen Courts and solely in connection with claims arising under or relating to this Agreement (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to the laying of venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any Party and (iv) agrees that mailing of

 (d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof to prevent breaches or threatened breaches in accordance with this Section 10.9 , without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 53 

restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

 To the extent the Company has distributed a quarterly payment to Blocker with respect to any of Q4 2024, Q1 2025, Q2 2025, Q3 2025 or Q4 2025 before the Closing in an amount equal to or in excess of the corresponding Synthetic Distribution Payment Amount set forth above for such quarter, then the corresponding Scheduled Payment for such quarter in respect thereof will not be included in the Seller Note and the amount of the Seller Note will be reduced by (1) the Excess Amount, less (2) the product of (a) the Excess Amount, multiplied by (b) the Applicable Percentage, with such reduction made to the earliest payment(s) due under the Seller Note. 
 The Excess Amount shall equal (1) the quarterly payment made to Blocker with respect to such quarter, less (2) the corresponding Synthetic Distribution Payment amount for such quarter. 
 The Applicable Percentage shall equal the product of (1) (a) 1 divided by (b) the Assumed Tax Rate (as calculated under the Company LLCA in effect as of the closing date), multiplied by (2) (a) with respect to the portion of each payment attributable to the post-Closing portion of a given quarter, the Blocker s effective U.S. tax rate for such quarter and (b) with respect to the portion of each payment attributable to the pre-Closing portion of a given quarter, the Blocker s combined U.S. federal and any applicable state and local marginal tax rate (taking into account any U.S. federal tax deduction for state and local taxes paid allowed by applicable law) with respect to the taxable income giving rise to such payment (or portion thereof). 
 EXAMPLE For Q4 2024, the Company makes a distribution of 570,000,000 to Blocker. The Seller Note principal amount will not be increased by any portion of the Q4 2024 Synthetic Distribution Payment because the Q4 2024 Synthetic Distribution Payment is less than the distribution the Blocker received from the Company with respect to Q4 2024. Further, the Seller Note principal amount will be reduced by an amount equal to (1) 36,000,000, less (2) the product of (a) 36,000,000, multiplied by (b) the Applicable Percentage. 
 To the extent any such quarterly Synthetic Distribution Payment is made before Closing in an amount less than the corresponding Synthetic Distribution Payment amount for such quarter, then an amount equal to (1) the Deficient Amount, less (2) the product of (a) the Deficient Amount, multiplied by (b) the Applicable Percentage, will be included in the Seller Note, plus simple interest accruing at a rate equal to 10 per annum commencing on the date of such deficient quarterly payment due date listed in the table above through the Closing Date. 
 The Deficient Amount shall equal (1) the Synthetic Distribution Payment amount with respect to such quarter, less (2) the quarterly payment made to Blocker with respect to such quarter. 
 EXAMPLE For Q4 2024, the Company makes a distribution of 500,000,000 to Blocker. The Seller Note principal amount will be increased by an amount equal to (1) 34,000,000, less (2) the product of (a) 34,000,000, multiplied by (b) the Applicable Percentage. 
 Any amount included in the Seller Note described in the preceding three paragraphs will continue to accrue interest at a rate equal to 10 per annum (from the due date listed in the table above). 
 For example, if Closing occurs on December 15, 2024 and the Q4 2024 quarterly distribution payment has been made in an amount equal to the corresponding Synthetic Distribution Payment amount for such quarter, the amounts of the Synthetic Distribution Payments for Q1 2025, Q2 2025, Q3 2025 and Q4 2025 will be included in the Seller Note. If Closing occurs on November 15, 2025 and the Q4 2025 quarterly distribution payment has not been made, only the amount of the Q4 2025 Synthetic Distribution Payment, plus the percentage of the amount of quarterly distribution that was less than the corresponding Synthetic Distribution Payment amount, calculated as shown above, will be included in the Seller Note. 
 Common Catch-Up Unreturned Contributions with respect to Blocker s Common Catch-Up Units, to the extent they are not fully paid to Blocker prior to the Closing, will be added to the principal amount under the Seller Note (and will be paid to Lender) solely when and if Blocker actually receives distributions from the Company in accordance with the current LLCA that reduce the Common Catch-Up Unreturned Contribution . 
 The payment by the Blocker to the Lender in respect of such Common Catch-Up Unreturned Contribution shall be deemed to reduce such increase in the principal amount under the Note in respect thereof on a dollar for dollar basis, and no interest shall accrue under the Note in respect thereof.

 (d) Gross Income Allocation . In the event that any Member has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit at the end of any Allocation Year, each such Member shall be allocated items of Company income and gain in the amount of such deficit as quickly as possible provided , however , that an allocation pursuant to this Section 3.2(d) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided for in this Section 3 have been tentatively made as if Section 3.2(c) and this Section 3.2(d) were not in this Agreement.

 (g) Section 754 Adjustments . To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Company asset, pursuant to Code Section 734(b) or Code Section 743(b) is required, pursuant to Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) or 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts as the result of a distribution to a Member in complete liquidation of such Member s Membership Interest, the amount of such adjustment to Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis) and such gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Members in accordance with their interests in the Company in the event Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) applies, or to the Member to whom such distribution was made in the event Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4) applies. 
 3.3 Curative Allocations . The allocations set forth in Sections 3.2 and 3.4 (the Regulatory Allocations are intended to comply with certain requirements of the Regulations. It is the intent of the Members that, to the extent possible, the Regulatory Allocations shall be offset either with special allocations of other items of Company income, gain, loss, or deduction pursuant to this Section 3.3 . Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3 (other than the Regulatory Allocations), the Managing Member shall make such offsetting special allocations of Company income, gain, loss, or deduction in whatever manner it determines appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each Member s Capital Account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the Capital Account balance such Member would have had if the Regulatory Allocations were not part of this Agreement.

 3.4 Loss Limitation . Losses allocated pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof shall not exceed the maximum amount of Losses that can be allocated without causing any Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit at the end of any Allocation Year. In the event some, but not all, of the Members would have Adjusted Capital Account Deficits as a consequence of an allocation of Losses pursuant to Section 3.1 , the limitation set forth in this Section 3.4 shall be applied on a Member by Member basis and Losses not allocable to any Member as a result of such limitation shall be allocated to the other Members in accordance with the positive balances in such Member s Capital Accounts so as to allocate the maximum permissible Losses to each Member under Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). 
 3.5 Other Allocation Rules . 
 (a) Profits, Losses, and any other items of income, gain, loss, or deduction shall be allocated to the Members pursuant to this Section 3 as of the last day of each Fiscal Year provided , however , that Profits, Losses, and such other items shall also be allocated at such times as the Gross Asset Values of the Company s assets are adjusted pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of the definition of Gross Asset Value in Section 1.11 . 
 (b) For purposes of determining the Profits, Losses, or any other items allocable to any period, Profits, Losses, and any such other items shall be determined on a daily, monthly or other basis as determined by the Managing Member using any permissible method under Code Section 706 and the Regulations thereunder.

In accordance with Code Section 704(c) and the Regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to any Property contributed (or deemed contributed) to the capital of the Company shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the Members so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such Property to the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes and its initial Gross Asset Value (computed in accordance with the definition of Gross Asset Value ).

SECTION 4 DISTRIBUTIONS 
 4.1 Amounts Distributed . 
 (a) Preferred Return Distributions . Except as otherwise provided in Section 13 , the Company shall make distributions, if, as and when declared by the Managing Member, to the Class A Limited Members on each Class A Distribution Date, in an amount equal to the cumulative amount of the Class A Limited Member Preferred Return accrued in respect of the related Class A Distribution Period for each such Class A Limited Member s Unrecovered Capital. Distributions pursuant to this Section 4.1(a) (including any distributions made subsequent to the Class A Distribution Date on which they were required to be made but prior to the succeeding Class A Distribution Date on which distributions are required to be made) shall be made to the Class A Limited Members of record fifteen (15) days prior to the relevant Class A Distribution Date. In the event that Managing Member declares a distribution in an amount less than the cumulative Class A Limited Member Preferred Return in respect of a particular Class A Distribution Period, and without limiting any other rights of the Class A Limited Members, the aggregate amount of the distribution shall be allocated between the Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests and, to the extent issued by the Company, the Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests in the same proportion as would have been the case had the full amount been declared and such amount shall be paid to the holders of Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests and Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests, as applicable, pro rata in proportion to their Unrecovered Capital of such class of Membership Interest. The Company shall make the distributions pursuant to this Section 4.1(a) to the Paying Agent or, at the Company s option, the Administrative Agent (if any) for the account of the Class A Limited Members, by wire transfer of same day funds in Dollars to such account as the Paying Agent or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall have designated in writing to the Company from time to time. The Company shall cause the Paying Agent or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to promptly thereafter distribute, from funds furnished by the Company, to each Class A Limited Member to such account or accounts as each Class A Limited Member shall have designated in writing to the Paying Agent or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, from time to time, the amount due to such Class A Limited Member pursuant to this Section 4.1(a) . 
 (b) Other Distributions . Any Cash Available for Distribution remaining after any distribution required pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or Section 13 to the Class A Limited Members has been made may be distributed by the Company to the Class B Common Members in such amounts as determined by the Managing Member, provided that (i) all distributions of the Class A Limited Member Preferred Return for all prior Class A Distribution Dates have been made, (ii) the Company will be in compliance with the Portfolio Requirements after giving effect to such distribution, (iii) a Notice Event described in Section 14.1(a) has not occurred, (iv) neither the Company nor the Managing Member is in breach of its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect, which breach remains uncured, and (v) any such permitted distribution is made promptly after the declaration thereof. 
 (c) Limitation . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not make a distribution to a Member on account of its Membership Interests if such distribution would violate the Act or other applicable law. 
 4.2 Tax Withholding . All payments and allocations to be made hereunder to the Members shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of, and without any deduction for, any Taxes, unless otherwise required by law. The Company agrees not to withhold on Preferred Return 
 -29- 

Distributions to Members (such Members, U.S. Net Taxpayer Members that have provided the Company with a true, correct and complete (a) IRS Form W-9 (excluding an IRS Form W-9 indicating that backup withholding is required) or (b) IRS Form W-8ECI, except as provided below. However, if the Company determines, in its reasonable discretion exercised in good faith and based on advice of its tax advisor, that any Taxes are required to be withheld under applicable law from any amounts distributable, payable or allocable to any Member hereunder (including in connection with any Class A Mandatory Remarketing), the Company or other relevant payor shall be entitled to deduct or withhold such Taxes and shall timely pay such Taxes to the relevant governmental entity in accordance with applicable law. Prior to making any deduction or withholding from Preferred Return Distributions to a U.S. Net Taxpayer Member, the Company shall provide ten (10) Business Days prior written notice to the extent reasonably practicable (and to the extent such notice is not reasonably practicable, shall provide written notice as soon as reasonably practicable) to such Member of the amounts subject to deduction or withholding and a reasonable opportunity to provide forms or other documentation that would eliminate or mitigate such deduction or withholding. To the extent payments are required to be made by the Company to a governmental entity on behalf of or with respect to a Member in accordance with this Section 4.2 in an amount that exceeds the amount deducted or withheld with respect to such Member, the excess amount shall, at the election of the Managing Member, (i) be applied to and reduce the next distribution(s) otherwise payable to such Member under this Agreement (except to the extent of any payment for penalties attributable to the Company s gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) be paid by the Member to the Company within thirty (30) days of written notice from the Managing Member requesting indemnification as described below. Any amount withheld pursuant to the Code or any other provision of federal, state or local tax or other law with respect to any distribution or payment to a Member shall be treated as an amount distributed or paid to such Member for all purposes under this Agreement. Each Member (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a former Member) agrees to indemnify the Company in full for any Taxes required to be paid to a governmental entity or regulatory authority in excess of amounts previously withheld by the Company with respect to such Member to the extent such Taxes are specifically attributable to such Member, including any interest, penalties (other than penalties attributable to the Company s gross negligence or willful misconduct) and reasonable out-of-pocket Expenses associated with such payments. For the avoidance of doubt, the Members agree for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence that failure to withhold under Section 1446 of the Code with respect to Preferred Return Distributions to U.S. Net Taxpayer Members would not constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct under current law. If it is asserted by the IRS that the Company is or was required to withhold tax under Section 1446 of the Code on any Preferred Return Distribution to any U.S. Net Taxpayer Member but (i) failed to do so, or (ii) paid less than the amount required under Section 1446 of the Code or the Regulations thereunder, the applicable Member agrees to cooperate to use commercially reasonable efforts to eliminate, mitigate and reduce any such withholding, any liability of the Company for tax that the Company is asserted to have failed to withhold and any associated penalties. The Managing Member agrees, absent a change in law occurring after the date hereof that would require withholding, that to the extent a Member provides (i) an IRS Form W-9 or (ii) a withholding certificate obtained through an application on IRS Form 8288-B or the procedures set forth in Rev. Proc. 2000-35 or any successor forms or procedures thereto, as applicable, (or evidence of the request for a withholding certificate) reducing or eliminating amounts otherwise required to be withheld or deducted and paid to the IRS prior to the date of any transaction giving rise to the obligation to withhold or deduct amounts attributable to such Member, it shall not withhold or deduct and pay over to the IRS any amount in excess of the amount required to be so withheld or deducted and paid as provided for on such withholding certificate provided under the foregoing clause (ii) provided that in the case of a pending request for such withholding certificate, the Managing Member shall be entitled to withhold the full amount required to be withheld or deducted, but shall not be entitled to pay over to the IRS any amount until (a) the issuance of such withholding certificate by the IRS and, at such time, shall only pay over to the IRS the amount 
 -30- 

required to be paid pursuant to such withholding certificate or (b) the IRS issues a notice of denial with respect to the request for such withholding certificate. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts withheld or deducted attributable to a Member in excess of the amount required to be paid to the IRS under the preceding sentence shall be payable to such Member. The obligations of an applicable Member under this Section 4.2 shall survive the termination, dissolution, liquidation and winding up of the Company, the withdrawal of any Member or the transfer of any Member s interest in the Company, and for purposes of this Section 4.2 , the Company shall be treated as continuing in existence. 
 4.3 Limitations on Distributions . The Company shall make no distributions to the Members except (i) as provided in this Section 4 and Section 13 , or (ii) to the extent not inconsistent with Section 4 and Section 13 or with the provisions of any of the other Transaction Documents, as agreed to in writing by all of the Members. 
 4.4 Distributions and Payments to Members . It is the intent of the Members that no distribution or payment to any Member (including distributions under Section 4.1 and Section 13.2 shall be deemed a return of money or other property in violation of the Act. The payment or distribution of any such money or property to a Member shall be deemed to be a compromise within the meaning of Section 18-502(b) of the Act, and the Member receiving any such money or property shall not be required to return any such money or property to the Company, any creditor of the Company or any other Person. However, if any court of competent jurisdiction holds that, notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, any Member is obligated to return such money or property, such obligation shall be the obligation of such Member and not of the Company, any other Member or the Managing Member. Any amounts required to be paid under such obligation shall be treated as a permitted additional Capital Contribution pursuant to Section 2.2 . 
 4.5 Term SOFR Not Determinable . 
 (a) If prior to the commencement of any Class A Distribution Period, the Required Class A Limited Members determine (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Term SOFR for such Class A Distribution Period, then such Required Class A Limited Members shall give notice thereof to the Company as promptly as practicable and, until such Required Class A Limited Members notify the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, the Floating Rate Class A Preferred Return Rate shall be calculated using the Prime Rate instead of the Term SOFR. 
 (a) If at any time the Required Class A Limited Members determine (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i) the circumstances set forth in Section 4.5(a) have arisen and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or (ii) the circumstances set forth in Section 4.5(a) have not arisen but the supervisor for the Term SOFR Administrator has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the Term SOFR shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, then such Required Class A Limited Members and the Company shall establish an alternate rate of interest to that based on the Term SOFR that gives due consideration to the then-prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for loans in the United States at such time, and such Required Class A Limited Members and the Company shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate rate of interest and such other related changes as the Company and such Required Class A Limited Members may determine to be appropriate (and for the avoidance of doubt, such amendment shall become effective without the consent of any other Person). Until an alternate rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with this Section 4.5(b) (but, in the case of the circumstances described in clause (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 4.5(b) , only to the extent the 
 -31- 

Term SOFR for such Class A Distribution Period is not available or published at such time on a current basis), Section 4.5(a) shall be applicable.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, including Section 18-1101(e) of the Act, an Independent Manager shall not be liable to the Company, the Members, the Managing Member or any other Person bound by this Agreement for breach of contract or breach of duties (including fiduciary duties), unless the Independent Manager acted in bad faith or engaged in willful misconduct or gross negligence.
