 million of notional amount of forward starting swaps which had been de-designated and terminated; however, as the forecasted debt transaction was still considered probable, the fair value of the instruments as of the de-designation remained within AOCI. In March 2024, the forecasted debt transaction took place with the issuance of the 2034 Notes, and the fair value of the instruments began amortizing to Interest expense, net over the term of the 2034 Notes. 
 FOREIGN EXCHANGE 
 We are exposed to foreign exchange risk in our international subsidiaries or with certain counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, which may transact in currencies that are different from the functional currencies of our legal entities. Additionally, the balance sheets of our Canadian and Mexican businesses are subject to exposure from movements in exchange rates. 
 Economic Hedges 
 We hold FX forward contracts to economically manage the balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in the FX rates described above. The intent of these FX contracts is to minimize the impact of FX risk associated with balance sheet positions not in local currency. In these cases, a hedging relationship exists in which changes in the fair value of the instruments act as an economic offset to changes in the fair value of the underlying items. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in earnings throughout the term of the derivative instrument and are reported in the same caption of the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as the associated risk. As of September 30, 2024, these FX contracts have maturities ranging from October 2024 to September 2026. 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 We designate certain FX forward contracts as cash flow hedges in order to manage the exposures resulting from changes in the FX rates described above. These designated FX forward contracts relate to forecasted inventory purchases in U.S. dollars of our Canadian and Mexican businesses. The intent of these FX contracts is to provide predictability in the Company's overall cost structure. As of September 30, 2024, these FX contracts have maturities ranging from October 2024 to December 2025. 
 COMMODITIES 
 Economic Hedges 
 We centrally manage the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process and transportation through various derivative contracts. We generally hold some combination of future, swap and option contracts that economically hedge certain of our risks. In these cases, a hedging relationship exists in which changes in the fair value of the instruments act as an economic offset to changes in the fair value of the underlying items or as an offset to certain costs of production. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in earnings throughout the term of the derivative instrument and are reported in the same line item of the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as the hedged transaction. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized as a component of unallocated corporate costs until our reportable segments are affected by the completion of the underlying transaction, at which time the gain or loss is reflected as a component of the respective segment's income from operations. As of September 30, 2024, these commodity contracts have maturities ranging from October 2024 to July 2026.

 FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
 The fair values of commodity contracts, interest rate contracts and FX forward contracts are determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets. The fair value of commodity contracts are valued using the market approach based on observable market transactions, primarily underlying commodities futures or physical index prices, at the reporting date. Interest rate contracts are valued using models based primarily on readily observable market parameters, such as SOFR forward rates, for all substantial terms of our contracts and credit risk of the counterparties. The fair value of FX forward contracts are valued using quoted forward FX prices at the reporting date. Therefore, we have categorized these contracts as Level 2.

 For the first nine months of 2024, the change in our effective tax rate was driven by the unfavorable comparison to the prior year tax benefit received from a non-cash adjustment and a shift in the mix of income from lower tax jurisdictions to higher tax jurisdictions.

We have also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and/or for which no estimate of possible losses can be made. We do not believe that the outcome of these, or any other, pending legal matters, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
 ANTITRUST LITIGATION 
 In February 2014, TreeHouse Foods, Inc. and certain affiliated entities filed suit against KDP s wholly-owned subsidiary, Keurig (formerly known as Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc.), in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York SDNY (TreeHouse Foods, Inc. et al. v. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc. et al.). The TreeHouse complaint asserted claims under the federal antitrust laws and various state laws, contending that Keurig had monopolized alleged markets for single serve coffee brewers and single serve coffee pods. The TreeHouse complaint sought treble monetary damages, declaratory relief, injunctive relief and attorneys fees. In the months that followed, a number of additional actions, including claims from another coffee manufacturer (JBR, Inc.), as well as putative class actions on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of Keurig s products, were filed in various federal district courts, asserting claims and seeking relief substantially similar to the claims asserted and relief sought in the TreeHouse complaint. Additional similar actions were filed by individual direct purchasers (including McLane Company, Inc., BJ s Wholesale Club, Inc., Winn-Dixie Stores Inc. and Bi-Lo Holding LLC) in 2019 and in 2021. All of these actions were transferred to the SDNY for coordinated pre-trial proceedings (In re: Keurig Green Mountain Single-Serve Coffee Antitrust Litigation) (the Multidistrict Antitrust Litigation ). 
 In July 2020, Keurig reached an agreement with one of the plaintiff groups in the Multidistrict Antitrust Litigation, the putative indirect purchaser class, to settle the claims asserted for million. The settlement class consisted of individuals and entities in the United States that purchased, from persons other than Keurig and not for purposes of resale, Keurig manufactured or licensed single serve beverage portion packs during the applicable class period (beginning in September 2010 for most states). The settlement was approved and paid, and the indirect purchasers claims have been dismissed. 
 Discovery in all remaining matters pending in the Multidistrict Antitrust Litigation is concluded, with the plaintiffs collectively claiming more than billion of monetary damages. Keurig strongly disputes the merits of the claims and the calculation of damages. As a result, Keurig has fully briefed summary judgment motions that, if successful, would end the cases entirely. Keurig has also fully briefed other significant motions, including challenges to the validity of plaintiffs damages calculations. Keurig is also pursuing its opposition to direct purchaser plaintiffs motion for class certification. Certain of Keurig s motions and opposition have been pending in the SDNY since 2021, with others pending since 2023. 
 Keurig intends to continue vigorously defending the remaining lawsuits. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits, the potential loss or range of loss, if any, associated with the resolution of these lawsuits or any potential effect they may have on us or our results of operations. Accordingly, we have not accrued for a loss contingency. Additionally, as the timelines in these cases may be beyond our control, we can provide no assurance as to whether or when there will be material developments in these matters.

 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in our Annual Report. 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, including, in particular, statements about the impact of future events, future financial performance, plans, strategies, business combinations, expectations, prospects, competitive environment, regulation, labor matters, supply chain issues, inflation, and availability of raw materials.

We have based these forward-looking statements on our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Our actual financial performance could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and the possibility that we are unable to successfully complete the GHOST transaction on the anticipated terms and timing or to successfully integrate GHOST into our business, and our financial performance may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.

Table of Contents 

 Net Sales. Net sales increased 86 million, or 2.3 , to 3,891 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3,805 million in the prior year period.

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG A expenses increased 28 million, or 2.3 , to 1,245 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1,217 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by unfavorable changes in unrealized commodity mark-to-market activity (4 percentage points), partially offset by reduced costs associated with restructuring and productivity projects (2 percentage points). 
 Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 6 million, or 0.7 , to 902 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 896 million in the prior year period, as our increase in gross profit was almost fully offset by increased SG A expenses.

This change reflected favorable year-over-year changes in unrealized mark-to-market activity (71 percentage points), partially offset by increased weighted average borrowings (17 percentage points). 
 Net Income. Net income increased 98 million, or 18.9 , to 616 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 518 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by reduced interest expense.

Income from operations decreased 45 million, or 5.8 , to 730 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 775 million in the prior year period, driven by the gross profit impact of the net sales decrease (13 percentage points) and costs associated with our 2024 Network Optimization program (4 percentage points), partially offset by a net benefit from changes in ingredients, materials, and productivity (8 percentage points) and lower people costs (1 percentage points).

 Net Sales. Net sales increased 8.9 to 1,554 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 1,427 million in the prior year period, reflecting volume/mix growth of 6.1 and higher net price realization of 3.4 , partially offset by unfavorable FX translation of 0.6 . 
 Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 88 million, or 26.6 , to 419 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 331 million in the prior year period. This performance reflected the gross profit impact of net sales growth (26 percentage points) and a net benefit from changes in ingredients, materials, and productivity (6 percentage points), partially offset by higher marketing investment (6 percentage points) and increased transportation and warehousing expenses (5 percentage points). 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require difficult, subjective or complex estimates and assessments. These estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary. These critical accounting estimates are discussed in greater detail in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Overview 
 We believe our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. We continue to manage all aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, monitoring the financial health of our customers, suppliers and other third-party relationships, implementing gross margin enhancement strategies through our productivity initiatives, and developing new opportunities for growth such as innovation and agreements with partners to distribute brands that are accretive to our portfolio. 
 Cash generated by our foreign operations is generally repatriated to the U.S. periodically as working capital funding requirements, where allowed. We do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future. 
 The following summarizes our cash activity for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023: 

Principal Sources of Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from our operations, and borrowing capacity currently available under our Revolving Credit Agreement. Additionally, we have an uncommitted commercial paper program where we can issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis. Based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. To the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary. At any time, and from time to time, we may seek additional deleveraging, refinancing or liquidity enhancing transactions, including entering into transactions to repurchase or redeem outstanding indebtedness or otherwise seek transactions to reduce interest expense, extend debt maturities and improve our capital and liquidity structure.

 Sources of Liquidity - Operations 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 338 million for the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the first nine months of 2023, driven by the favorable comparison in working capital versus the prior year period. 
 Cash Conversion Cycle 
 Our cash conversion cycle is defined as DIO and DSO less DPO. The calculation of each component of the cash conversion cycle is provided below: 
 Component Calculation (on a trailing twelve month basis) DIO (Average inventory divided by cost of sales) Number of days in the period DSO (Accounts receivable divided by net sales) Number of days in the period DPO (Accounts payable Number of days in the period) divided by cost of sales and SG A expenses 
 The following table summarizes our cash conversion cycle: 
 September 30, 2024 2023 DIO 67 72 DSO 35 32 DPO 98 127 Cash conversion cycle 4 (23) 
 Our cash conversion cycle increased 27 days to approximately 4 days as of September 30, 2024 as compared to (23) days as of September 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by the decrease in DPO, reflecting the reduction of payment terms for certain suppliers. 
 Accounts Payable Program 
 As part of our ongoing efforts to improve our cash flow and related liquidity, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which includes payment terms. Excluding our suppliers who require cash at date of purchase or sale, our current payment terms with our suppliers generally range from 10 to 360 days. We also enter into agreements with third party administrators to allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us, and, if voluntarily elected by the supplier, sell payment obligations from us to financial institutions. Suppliers can sell one or more of our payment obligations at their sole discretion and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted.

 Sources of Liquidity - Financing 
 
 Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for management's discussion of our financing arrangements. 
 We also have an active shelf registration statement, filed with the SEC on August 19, 2022, which allows us to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants from time to time in one or more offerings at the direction of our Board. 
 
 Debt Ratings 
 Our credit ratings are as follows: 
 Rating Agency Long-Term Debt Rating Commercial Paper Rating Outlook Moody's Baa1 P-2 Stable S P BBB A-2 Stable 
 These debt and commercial paper ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements. A downgrade of one or both of our debt and commercial paper ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and we have no reason to believe that we will be unable to satisfy these covenants. 
 
 Principal Uses of Capital Resources 
 Our capital allocation priorities are investing to grow our business both organically and inorganically, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders through regular quarterly dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. We dynamically adjust our cash deployment plans based on the specific opportunities available in a given period, but over time we allocate capital to balance each of these priorities. 
 Regular Quarterly Dividends 
 We have declared total dividends of 0.66 per share and 0.615 per share for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Repurchases of Common Stock 
 Our Board authorized a four-year share repurchase program, ending December 31, 2025, of up to 4 billion of our outstanding common stock. We repurchased and retired 1,105 million of common stock during the first nine months of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 1,810 million remained available for repurchase under the authorized share repurchase program.

 Capital Expenditures 
 Purchases of property, plant and equipment were 398 million and 271 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Capital expenditures, which includes both purchases of property, plant and equipment and amounts included in accounts payable and accrued expenses, for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 primarily related to investments in manufacturing capabilities, both in the U.S. and internationally. Capital expenditures included in accounts payable and accrued expenses were 164 million and 196 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, which primarily related to these investments. 
 Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates 
 From time to time, we expect to invest in beverage startup companies or in brand ownership companies to grow our presence in certain product categories, or enter into various licensing and distribution agreements to expand our product portfolio. Our investments generally involve acquiring a minority interest in equity securities of a company, in certain cases with a protected path to ownership at our future option. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates were 7 million and 308 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Acquisitions of Businesses and Purchases of Intangible Assets 
 We have invested in the expansion of our DSD network through transactions with strategic independent bottlers or third-party brand ownership companies to ensure competitive distribution scale. From time to time, we additionally acquire brand ownership companies to expand our portfolio. These transactions could be accounted for either as an acquisition of a business or as an asset acquisition, as the majority of the transaction price represents the acquisition of a single intangible asset. In the third quarter of 2024, we completed the Kalil Acquisition for total consideration of 103 million. Purchases of intangible assets were 49 million and 55 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Uncertainties and Trends Affecting Liquidity 
 Disruptions in financial and credit markets, including those caused by inflation, global economic uncertainty and fluctuations in interest rates, may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. These disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us, thus reducing our cash flow, or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials. 
 Customer and consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by the risk factors discussed under "Risk Factors" in Part 1, Item 1A of our Annual Report, as well as subsequent filings with the SEC, that could have a material effect on production, delivery and consumption of our products, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume. 
 
 SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"), as defined in the indentures governing the Notes.

None of our subsidiaries organized outside of the U.S., any of the subsidiaries held by Maple Parent Holdings Corp. prior to the DPS Merger or any of the subsidiaries acquired after the DPS Merger (collectively, the "Non-Guarantors") guarantee the Notes. The subsidiary guarantees with respect to the Notes are subject to release upon the occurrence of certain events, including the sale of all or substantially all of a subsidiary's assets, the release of the subsidiary's guarantee of our other indebtedness, our exercise of the legal defeasance option with respect to the Notes and the discharge of our obligations under the applicable indenture.
