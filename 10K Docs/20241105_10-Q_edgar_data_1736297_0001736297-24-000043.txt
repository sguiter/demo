 Special Note about Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which are statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as will, shall, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, or continue or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading Risk Factors included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q and those included within our final prospectus dated March 19, 2024, as filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q include, but are not limited to, statements about: 
 
 our expectations regarding our revenue, expenses, and other operating results; 
 our ability to acquire new customers and grow our customer base; 
 our ability to successfully retain existing customers and expand sales within our existing customer base; 
 launching new products, adding new product capabilities and the market potential of those products and capabilities; 
 future investments in developing and enhancing our business; 
 our expectations regarding our ability to expand; 
 our anticipated capital expenditures and our estimates regarding our capital requirements; 
 the estimated size of our overall market opportunity; 
 investments in our selling and marketing efforts; 
 our ability to compete effectively with existing competitors and new market entrants; 
 our reliance on our senior management team and our ability to identify, recruit, and retain skilled personnel; 
 our ability to effectively manage our growth; 
 economic and industry trends and other macroeconomic factors, such as fluctuating interest rates and inflation; and 
 the impact of global pandemics, health crises, political conflicts and other global financial, economic, and political events on our industry, business, and results of operations. 
 
 We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. 
 
 We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on management s current beliefs and our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 

Table of Contents 

 The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments we may make. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we, in the future, may file with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10 K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q and Current Reports on Form 8 K. 
 
 In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information.

 Effective tax rate ) ) ) 
 The Company accrues for income taxes during interim periods based on the estimated effective tax rate for the year. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is different than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the valuation allowance in the United States and the capitalization of research and development expenditures under Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code, which results in current tax expense. This is offset by benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, significant increase in stock-based compensation tax deduction, and U.S. research and development credits. 
 I ncome tax provision consists primarily of U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes. The Company maintains a full valuation allowance on its federal and state deferred tax assets as it has concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research and development expenditures under Internal Revenue Code Section 174 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. The rule became effective for the Company in 2022 and resulted in the capitalization of research and development costs which was offset by a valuation allowance. The Company will amortize these costs for tax purposes over 5 years for research and development performed in the U.S., and over 15 years for research and development performed outside of the United States. 
 The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The Company recognizes the tax effects of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date and only in an amount more likely than not to be sustained upon review by the tax authorities. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are classified in the condensed consolidated financial statements as income tax expense.

 Summary of Financial Highlights 
 
 Our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 206 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in overall unit shipments driven by higher demand for our Aries products. Gross margin increased by 160 basis points bps to 77.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 76.1 for t he three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in product mix and lower average unit cost. 
 
 Our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 291 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in overall unit shipments driven by higher demand for our Aries products. Gross margin increased 1,520 bps to 77.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 62.5 for t he nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in product mix, lower average unit cost, and a 9.2 million decrease from inventory write-downs. The inventory write-downs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were due primarily to inventory in excess of our sales forecast for a legacy customer product. 
 
 Operating expenses increased by 66.7 million, or 222 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase of 42.7 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense r esulting from the time-based vesting of restricted stock units RSUs after the liquidity event condition was satisfied in connection with our IPO, and a 11.5 million higher in personnel-related expenses as a result of a 71 increase in headcount. 
 
 Operating expenses increased by 235.1 million, or 296 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase of 178.3 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense primarily due to both RSUs that had previously met the time-based and liquidity event vesting conditions in connection with our IPO as well as RSUs with time-based vesting after the liquidity event, and a 31.2 million increase in personnel-related expenses as a result of a 50 increase in headcount. 
 
 Initial Public Offering 
 On March 22, 2024, we completed our initial public offering (the IPO of shares of our common stock, par value per share (our Common Stock ), at a price to the public of per share, which included shares of Common Stock sold by us, inclusive of shares sold by us pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option, as well as shares of Common Stock sold by certain of our existing stockholders. We received net proceeds of million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million, and we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by our existing shareholders in the IPO. In connection with the IPO, we recognized deferred offering costs of million. 
 We recognized million of cumulative stock-based compensation expense associated with the time-based vesting and settlement of RSUs that had previously met the time-based vesting condition and for which the liquidity event vesting condition was satisfied in connection with our IPO. Based on our IPO price of 36.00 per share, our tax withholding obligation in connection with the vesting of these RSUs was 20.1 million, which we paid in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Key Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 The vast majority of our revenue consists of product sales and a small portion is derived from engineering services. Product sales consists primarily of shipments of our Intelligent Connectivity Platform solutions. Engineering services revenue consists of engineering fees associated with customer-defined engineering services. Engineering services revenue accounted for an immaterial percentage of total revenue for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue includes cost of product sales and cost of engineering services. Cost of product sales includes the cost of materials, such as wafers processed by third-party foundries, cost associated with packaging, assembly, shipping, depreciation of equipment associated with manufacturing, cost of logistics and quality assurance, warranty cost, amortization of capitalized production masks, cost of personnel including salaries, stock-based compensation, employee benefits, write-down of inventories, and allocation of general corporate expenses.

Table of Contents 

 While amortization of capitalized production masks has historically not been material, we expect to incur significant amortization costs in the future as we continue to increase the number of additional products. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Gross profit represents revenue less cost of revenue. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross profit has been, and may in the future be, influenced by several factors, including sales volume, pricing of our products and services, changes in product costs, contract manufacturing supplier pricing, personnel costs, shipping, logistics costs, and inventory write-downs. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, and bonuses. Operating expenses also include software license costs, pre-production engineering mask costs, professional and consulting services fees, and overhead costs for facilities and other shared expenses, including depreciation expense. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities and include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, bonuses, pre-production engineering mask costs, software license costs, prototype wafer, packaging and test costs, and allocated facilities expenses. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Pre-production engineering mask costs are expensed. We capitalize the costs of production masks with alternative future use and amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the useful lives. To determine if a production mask has alternative future use or benefits, we evaluate risks associated with developing new technologies and capabilities, and the related risks associated with entering new markets. Production masks that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are expensed as research and development costs. 
 We believe that continued investments in our products are important to our future growth and, as a result, we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and moderately decline as a percentage of revenue over time as our revenue increases. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs including salaries, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, bonuses, samples to potential customers, travel and entertainment costs, and allocated facilities expenses. 
 We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we increase our sales and marketing personnel and continue to expand our customer engagement with more design activities and increased product offerings and moderately decline as a percentage of revenue over time as our revenue increases. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs including salaries, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits and bonuses related to corporate, finance, legal and human resource functions, professional services fees, audit and compliance expenses, insurance costs, and general corporate expenses including allocated facilities expenses. 
 We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we grow our operations and incur additional expenses associated with operating as a public company and moderately decline as a percentage of revenue over time as our revenue increases. These expenses as a result of operating as a public company include expenses necessary to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange and related compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as higher expenses for general and director and officer insurance, investor relations, and other professional services.

 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists of income earned on our short-term investments included in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 Income tax provision consists primarily of U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain financial measures that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), which we use to supplement the performance measures in our consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. We refer to these measures as non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss). We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to assist us in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin 
 We define non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit presented in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expenses. The non-GAAP gross margin is non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. We have presented non-GAAP gross profit because we consider non-GAAP gross profit to be a useful metric for investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating performance as it excludes the impact of stock-based compensation, a charge that can vary from period to period for reasons that are unrelated to our core operating performance. This metric also provides investors and other users of our financial information with an additional tool to eliminate the effects of items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to core operating performanc e . 
 A reconciliation of our GAAP gross profit and gross margin, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin is presented below:

 Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) 
 We define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as operating loss presented in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expenses and employer payroll taxes related to the time-based vesting and net settlement of RSUs with a liquidity event-based vesting condition that was satisfied in connection with the IPO. We have presented non-GAAP operating income (loss) because we consider non-GAAP operating income (loss) to be a useful metric for investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating performance as it excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to the time-based vesting and net settlement of restricted stock units in connection with our IPO, a charge that can vary from period to period for reasons that are unrelated to our core operating performance. This metric also provides investors and other users of our financial information with an additional tool to eliminate the effects of items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to core operating performanc e .

 (2) Employer payroll taxes related to the time-based vesting and settlement of RSUs that had previously met the time-based vesting condition and for which the liquidity event vesting condition was satisfied in connection with our IPO. 
 Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) 
 We monitor non-GAAP net income (loss) for planning and performance measurement purposes. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as net loss reported on our condensed consolidated statements of operations, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expenses, employer payroll taxes related to the time-based vesting and net settlement of RSUs with a liquidity event-based vesting condition that was satisfied in connection with our IPO, and the related tax impact on the adjustments. We have presented non-GAAP net income (loss) because we believe that the exclusion of these charges allows for a more relevant comparison of our results of operations to other companies in our industry and facilitates period-to-period comparisons as it eliminates the effect of certain factors unrelated to our overall operating performance.

Tax adjustments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were not material. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the issuance of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, our IPO , and cash generated from the sale of our products. As of September 30, 2024 , our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of 886.8 million and working capital of 857.5 million . Our principal use of cash is t o fund our operations, invest in research and development, fund production mask capital expenditures and to support our overall growth. 
 We have generated significant losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities in the past as reflected in our accumulated deficit of 233.5 million as of September 30, 2024 . We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months and beyond. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factor s , including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and research and development expenditures, capital expenditures for production masks, the continuing market acceptance of our product s , and the use of cash to fund potential mergers or acquisitions. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and debt. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:

Table of Contents 

 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 97.0 million resulted primarily from non-cash charges of 187.3 million primarily related to 186.4 million in stock-based compensation expense and cash provided by operating assets and liabilities of 17.8 million offset by a net loss of 108.1 million. Cash provided by operating assets and liabilities during the period was primarily from 31.1 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to accrued customer deposits and timing of payments, and a 11.7 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments. The net cash flow provided by operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by an increase of 17.1 million in accounts receivable due to higher product sales and timing of customer payments, a 5.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily related to accrued interest receivable on our short-term investments, 1.7 million decrease in operating lease liability, and a 1.3 million increase in inventory. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 o f 27.1 million resulted primarily a net loss of 40.6 million and cash used in operating assets and liabilities of 5.6 million offset by non-cash charges of 19.1 million. Cash used in operating assets and liabilities during the period was primarily from a 6.5 million increase in accounts receivable due to timing of customer payments and 1.0 million of lower operating lease liabilities due to timing. These cash flow uses were partially offset by a 2.2 million increase accrued expenses and other liabilities related to growth in our operations. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 666.1 million was the result of 724.9 million in purchases of marketable securities and 18.8 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by 77.6 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 11.8 million was the result of 102.8 million in purchases of marketable securities and 1.8 million in purchases of property and equipment. This was partially offset by 92.8 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 650.2 million was the result of 672.2 million in proceeds from our IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and 2.9 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options net of repurchases. This was partially offset by 20.1 million in tax withholding related to net share settlement of RSUs that had previously met the time-based vesting condition and for which the liquidity event vesting condition was satisfied in connection with our IPO, and 4.8 million in payments of deferred offering costs. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 0.6 million was the result of 0.7 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options net of repurchases, partially offset by 0.1 million payments of deferred offering costs.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be affected. 
 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as described in our Prospectus.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 126.1 million and marketable securities of 760.7 million, which consisted of cash held in sweep accounts, checking accounts, money market funds, U.S. treasury and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and asset-backed securities. The cash and cash equivalents are held primarily for working capital purposes. Such interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. To date, fluctuations in interest income are primarily driven by increases in investment balances. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-term nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would change the fair value of our investment in marketable securities by 7.1 million and 0.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Our reporting currency and the functional currency of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in Taiwan, Canada, China, India, and Israel is the U.S. dollar. All of our sales and operating expenses are transacted in U.S. dollars, and therefore our revenue and expenses are not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments, although we may choose to do so in the future. We do not believe that a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies would have a material effect on our operating results. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024, which was the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 Notwithstanding these identified material weaknesses, management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, believes that the interim condensed financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. 
 
 Previously Reported Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As previously disclosed in the Prospectus, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as follows: 
 
 We did not adequately design and maintain an effective risk assessment process at a sufficient precision level to identify risks of material misstatement in our consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the implementation of controls was not sufficient to respond to risks of material misstatement to financial reporting, including a lack of effectively designed controls over segregation of duties, particularly over the preparation and review of journal entries and account reconciliations. 
 
 This material weakness could result in a misstatement of substantially all of the financial statement accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 
 We did not design and maintain effective information technology IT general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of our financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain: (i) program change management controls to ensure that program and data changes are identified, tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately; (ii) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user and privileged access to appropriate personnel; (iii) computer operations controls to ensure that processing and transfer of data, and data backups and recovery are monitored; and (iv) program development controls to ensure that new software development is tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately. 
 
 These IT deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements, however, the deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact maintaining effective segregation of duties, as well as the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement to one or more assertions, along with the IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of system-generated data and reports) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, we have determined these deficiencies in the aggregate constitute a material weakness. 
 
 Remediation Efforts to Address Previously Identified Material Weaknesses 
 
 We are taking steps to remediate these material weaknesses through the implementation of business processes and IT general controls. We plan to review business processes and IT processes and design and implement internal controls consistent with the principles of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO framework to address the risks of material misstatement. Such activities may include designing and implementing new business processes, enhancing information and communication processes, assessing risk, improvements to control documentation, enhancements to segregation of duties and access rights, and deployment of new IT systems and system functionalities as necessary. We also plan to establish a monitoring function over internal control over financial reporting, including internal audit, to evaluate and enhance internal controls consistent with the COSO framework and the requirements of a public company. We further plan to implement and operate an appropriate set of IT general controls covering all financially significant systems, which includes controls covering security administration, segregation of duties, computer operations, system implementations, change management, complementary user controls for hosted systems, oversight activities for significant third-party vendors and others. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the remediation efforts, which have been or are in the process of being implemented, are intended to address the identified material weaknesses, and include: 
 engagement with external consultants with extensive Sarbanes-Oxley Act experience; 
 designing and implementing controls related to the formalization of our accounting policies and procedures and financial reporting; 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 hiring additional staff and development of accounting processes to further segregate accounting responsibilities; and 
 designing and implementing controls related to significant accounts and disclosures to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including controls over account reconciliations, segregation of duties and the preparation and review of journal entries. 
 We have formed a formal Disclosure Committee that has oversight responsibility for the accuracy and timeliness of quarterly disclosures made by us through controls and procedures and the monitoring of their integrity and effectiveness. 
 
 We have made progress towards designing and implementing the plan to remediate the material weaknesses and will continue to review, revise, and improve the design and implementation of our internal controls as appropriate. Although we have made enhancements to our control procedures, these material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until our controls are effectively designed and operational for a sufficient period of time, and management concludes, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Accordingly, the material weaknesses are not remediated as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls.

 Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently a party to any material pending legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 For a discussion of potential risks and uncertainties, see the information in the section titled Risk Factors in the Prospectus. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our Prospectus. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.
