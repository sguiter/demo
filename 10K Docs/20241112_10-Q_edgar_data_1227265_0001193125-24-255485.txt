In the event of default by the Partnership, MS Co., the Partnership s commodity futures broker 
and the sole counterparty to the Partnership s non-exchange-traded
 contracts, as applicable, has the right to offset the Partnership s obligation with the Partnership s cash and/or U.S. Treasury bills held by MS Co., thereby minimizing MS Co. s risk of loss. In certain instances, MS Co. may not post collateral and as such, in the event of default by MS Co., the Partnership is exposed to the amount shown in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. In the case of exchange-traded contracts, the Partnership s exposure to counterparty risk may be reduced since the exchange s clearinghouse interposes its credit between buyer and seller and the clearinghouse s guarantee funds may be available in the event of a default. In some instances, the actual collateral received and/or pledged may be more than the amount shown due to overcollateralization.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

 (Unaudited) 

 to of the Partnership s/Funds contracts are traded OTC. 

 Futures Contracts

. The Partnership and the Funds trade futures contracts. A futures contract is a firm commitment to buy or sell a specified quantity of investments, currency or a standardized amount of a deliverable grade commodity, at a specified price on a specified future date, unless the contract is closed before the delivery date or if the delivery quantity is something where physical delivery cannot occur (such as the S P 500 Index), whereby such contract is settled in cash. Payments variation margin may be made or received by the Partnership and the Funds each business day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying contracts, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Partnership and the Funds. When the contract is closed, the Partnership and the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed. Transactions in futures contracts require participants to make both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin deposits, through the futures broker, with the exchange on which the contracts are traded. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on futures contracts are included in the Partnership s/Funds Consolidated Statements of Income and Expenses. 

 Forward Foreign Currency Contracts. 

Forward foreign currency contracts are those contracts where the Partnership and the Funds agree to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of foreign currency for an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon future date. Forward foreign currency contracts are valued daily, and the Partnership s and the Funds net equity therein, representing unrealized gain or loss on the contracts as measured by the difference between the forward foreign exchange rates at the dates of entry into the contracts and the forward foreign exchange rates at the reporting date, is included in the Partnership s/Funds Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on forward foreign currency contracts are recognized in the period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur, respectively, and are included in the Partnership s/Funds Consolidated Statements of Income and Expenses. 

 London Metal Exchange Forward Contracts. 

Metal contracts traded on the London Metal Exchange LME represent a firm commitment to buy or sell a specified quantity of aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin, zinc or other metals. LME contracts traded by the Partnership and the Funds are cash-settled based on prompt dates published by the LME. Variation margin may be made or received by the Partnership and the Funds each business day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying contracts, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Partnership and the Funds. A contract is considered offset when all long positions have been matched with a like number of short positions settling on the same prompt date. When the contract is closed at the prompt date, the Partnership and the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed. Transactions in LME contracts require participants to make both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin deposits, through the broker, with the LME. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on metal contracts are included in the Partnership s/Funds Consolidated Statements of Income and Expenses. 

Options

. The Partnership and the Funds may purchase and write (sell) both exchange-listed and OTC options on commodities or financial instruments. An option is a contract allowing, but not requiring, its holder to buy (call) or sell (put) a specific or standard commodity or financial instrument at a specified price during a specified time period. The option premium is the total price paid or received for the option contract. When the Partnership/Funds write an option, the premium received is recorded as a liability in the Partnership s/Funds Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and marked-to-market

 daily. When the Partnership/Funds purchase an option, the premium paid is recorded as an asset in the Partnership s/Funds Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and marked-to-market

 daily. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on option contracts are included in the Partnership s/Funds Consolidated Statements of Income and Expenses. 

 As both a buyer and seller of options, the Partnership/Funds pay or receive a premium at the outset and then bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option. Written options expose the Partnership/Funds to potentially unlimited liability; for purchased options, the risk of loss is limited to the premiums paid. Certain written put options permit cash settlement and do not require the option holder to own the reference asset. The Partnership/Funds do not consider these contracts to be guarantees. 

Futures-Style Options.

 The Partnership/Funds may trade futures-style option contracts. Unlike traditional option contracts, the premiums for futures-style option contracts are not received or paid upon the onset of the trade. The premiums are recognized and received or paid as part of the sales price when the contract is closed. Similar to a futures contract, variation margin for the futures-style option contract may be made or received by the Partnership/Funds each business day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying contracts, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Partnership/Funds. Transactions in futures-style option contracts require participants to make both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin deposits, through the futures broker, directly with the exchange on which the contracts are traded. Futures-style option contracts are presented as part of Net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts or Net unrealized depreciation on open futures contracts, as applicable, in the Partnership s/Funds Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on futures-style option contracts are included in the Partnership s/Funds Consolidated Statements of Income and Expenses. 

 Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the Partnership/Funds due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded. The Partnership and the Funds are exposed to market risk equal to the value of the futures and forward contracts held and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. 

Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. The Partnership s/Funds risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the Partnership s/Funds Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and is not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments. The Partnership s/Funds risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the Partnership/Funds to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events. The Partnership/Funds have credit risk and concentration risk as MS Co. or an MS Co. affiliate are counterparties or brokers with respect to the Partnership s and the Funds assets. For certain OTC contracts traded by certain Funds, JPMorgan is the counterparty with respect to those assets. Credit risk with respect to exchange-traded instruments is reduced to the extent that, through MS Co. or an MS Co. affiliate, the Partnership s/Funds counterparty is an exchange or clearing organization. 

The General Partner/Trading Manager monitors and attempts to mitigate the Partnership s/Funds risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and risk management monitoring systems, and accordingly, believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the Partnership/Funds may be subject. These monitoring systems generally allow the General Partner/Trading Manager to statistically analyze actual trading results with risk-adjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics. In addition, online monitoring systems provide account analysis of futures, exchange-cleared swaps, forward and option contracts by sector, margin requirements, gain and loss transactions and collateral positions.

The majority of these financial instruments mature within of the inception date. However, due to the nature of the Partnership s/Funds business, these instruments may not be held to maturity. 
 The risk to the limited partners that have purchased Redeemable Units is limited to the amount of their share of the Partnership s net assets and undistributed profits. This limited liability is a result of the organization of the Partnership as a limited partnership under New York law.

Item 2. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . Liquidity and Capital Resources The Partnership does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services. Its assets are its (i) investment in the Funds, (ii) redemptions receivable from the Funds, (iii) its equity in trading account, consisting of unrestricted cash, restricted cash, net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts, net unrealized appreciation on open forward contracts, options purchased at fair value and investment in U.S. Treasury bills at fair value, if applicable and (iv) interest receivable. Because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading, relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the Partnership, through its investment in the Funds and direct investments. While substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity occurred during the third quarter of 2024. The Partnership s/Funds investment in futures, forwards and options may, from time to time, be illiquid. Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits. Trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. If the price for a particular futures or option contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in that futures or option contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. These market conditions could prevent the Partnership and/or the Funds from promptly liquidating their futures or option contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions. There is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies. The markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent the Partnership and/or the Funds from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the Partnership and/or the Funds from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets, subjecting them to substantial losses. Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions. For the periods covered by this report, illiquidity has not materially affected the Partnership s or the Funds assets. Other than the risks inherent in commodity futures, forwards, options, swaps and other derivatives trading and U.S. Treasury bills and money market mutual fund securities, the Partnership and the Funds know of no trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the Partnership s or the Funds liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. The Partnership s capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by realized and/or unrealized gains or losses on trading and by expenses, interest income, subscriptions and redemptions of Redeemable Units and distributions of profits, if any. The Partnership s primary need for capital resources is for Futures Interests trading. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Partnership s capital decreased 12.6 from 329,200,714 to 287,577,264. This decrease was attributable to redemptions of 11,110.3150 Class A limited partner Redeemable Units totaling 38,307,824, redemptions of 375.6590 Class Z limited partner Redeemable Units totaling 544,337, redemptions of 203.1170 Class Z General Partner Redeemable Units totaling 300,430 and a net loss of 5,465,539, which was partially offset by subscriptions of 872.9890 Class A limited partner Redeemable Units totaling 2,981,680 and subscriptions of 8.7890 Class Z limited partner Redeemable Units totaling 13,000. Future redemptions can impact the amount of funds available for investment in subsequent periods. Other than as discussed above, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to, the Partnership s capital resource arrangements at the present time. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Partnership does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments, that would affect its liquidity or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. The General Partner believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Partnership s significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Financial Statements. The Partnership and the Funds record all investments at fair value in their financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Expenses.

Results of Operations During the Partnership s third quarter of 2024, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class A decreased 7.0 from 3,517.65 to 3,271.25, as compared to a decrease of 1.7 in the third quarter of 2023. During the Partnership s third quarter of 2024, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class Z decreased 6.8 from 1,479.10 to 1,378.08, as compared to a decrease of 1.5 in the third quarter of 2023. The Partnership experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses in the third quarter of 2024 of 22,854,942. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership s/Funds trading of commodity futures in currencies, energy, grains, indices, livestock and metals and were partially offset by gains in U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates and softs. The Partnership experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses in the third quarter of 2023 of 7,181,231. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership s/Funds trading of commodity futures in currencies, grains, indices, non-U.S. interest rates and metals and were partially offset by gains in energy, livestock, U.S. interest rates and softs. During the third quarter, the Partnership s most notable losses for the quarter were incurred within the currencies during July and August from short positions in the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the yen surged higher as the Bank of Japan raised interest rates. Additional currency losses were experienced from trading in European cross rate positions during July. In the energies, losses were recorded from long positions in crude oil futures throughout the quarter as oil prices steadily declined amid high global inventories and concerns a slowdown in the global economy would limit energy demand. Losses in the global stock index sector were experienced primarily during August from long positions in Asian, European, and U.S. equity index futures as stock prices dropped early in the month after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates and a broad sell-off in technology stocks occurred. In the agricultural complex, losses were incurred during September from short positions in soybean, wheat, and corn futures as grain prices reversed higher amid a wave of global buying. Additional losses in the agricultural markets were recorded during August from long positions in live cattle futures. In the metals markets, losses were experienced during July from long positions in copper futures as prices declined amid a slowdown in industrial purchasing from China. A portion of the Partnership s losses for the third quarter was offset by gains achieved within the global fixed income sector during September from long positions in U.S., Canadian, and European fixed income futures as interest rate yields across the globe fell and prices rose amid speculation central banks would be aggressive in rate cuts going into year-end. Additional gains were recorded July and September from long positions in shipping freight futures as prices rallied amid concerns growing tensions in the Middle East would disrupt key trade routes. During the Partnership s nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class A decreased 2.2 from 3,346.39 to 3,271.25, as compared to a decrease of 0.3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the Partnership s nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class Z decreased 1.7 from 1,401.81 to 1,378.08, as compared to an increase of 0.3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Partnership experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 5,780,823. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership s/Funds trading of commodity futures in currencies, energy, grains, non-U.S. interest rates and livestock and were partially offset by gains in indices, metals, U.S. interest rates and softs. The Partnership experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 992,442. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership s/Funds trading of commodity futures in energy, grains, U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates and metals and were partially offset by gains in currencies, indices, livestock and softs. During the first nine months of the year, the Partnership s largest losses were incurred within the energy markets during much of the second and third quarters from long positions in crude oil futures as prices declined steadily amid high global inventories and concerns a slowdown in the global economy would limit energy demand. Further losses in the energies were experienced during June from long positions in European electrical power futures and during September from short positions in global natural gas futures. Losses in the currencies were primarily experienced during the second quarter from long positions in the Mexican peso as the value of peso reversed lower after proposed government reform spooked investors. Additional losses were incurred in the global fixed income sector during January and February from long positions in European fixed income futures amid a murky outlook regarding central bank actions in battling inflation. Further losses were experienced within the global fixed income futures markets from short positions in European fixed income futures during April and June. A portion of the Partnership s overall losses for the first nine months of the year was offset by gains were achieved within the agricultural markets during the first four months of the year from long positions in cocoa futures as cocoa prices surged to record highs amid concerns extremely hot weather in key West African growing regions would severely damage crops. Further gains in the agriculturals were recorded from long positions in coffee futures throughout much of the first three quarters of the year. Gains were also achieved throughout the first nine months of the year from long positions in shipping freight index futures as turmoil and attacks on shipping tankers in the Red Sea pushed prices higher. Gains within the global stock index sector were achieved during each month of the first quarter from long positions in Asian, European, and U.S. equity index futures as the outlook for global central banks, most notably the Fed, to be aggressive in cutting interest rates in 2024 spurred investor demand for stock buying. In the metals, gains were experienced during March, April, and May from long positions in gold and silver futures as easing inflationary pressures boosted demand for precious metals. 
 24 

Commodity markets are highly volatile. Broad price fluctuations and rapid inflation increase the risks involved in commodity trading, but also increase the possibility for profit. The profitability of the Partnership/Funds depends on the existence of major price trends and the ability of the Advisors to correctly identify those price trends. Price trends are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand relationships, weather, public health epidemics, governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international political and economic events and changes in interest rates. To the extent that market trends exist and the Advisors are able to identify them, the Partnership/Funds expect to increase capital through operations. As of September 30, 2024, interest income was earned on 100 of the average daily equity maintained in cash in the Partnership s (or the Partnership s allocable portion of a Fund s, except for Transtrend Master s) brokerage account during each month at the rate equal to the monthly average of the 4-week U.S. Treasury bill discount rate. MS Co. will pay monthly interest to Transtrend Master on 100 of the average daily equity maintained in cash in Transtrend Master s brokerage account during each month at the rate equal to the monthly average of the 4-week U.S. Treasury bill discount rate less 0.15 during such month but in no event less than zero. When the effective rate is less than zero, no interest is earned. For the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership/Funds will not receive interest on amounts in the futures brokerage account that are committed to margin. Any interest earned on the Partnership s and/or each Fund s cash account in excess of the amounts described above, if any, will be retained by MS Co. and/or shared with the General Partner. All interest earned on U.S. Treasury bills and money market mutual fund securities will be retained by the Partnership and/or the Funds, as applicable. Any interest income earned on collateral or excess cash deposited by certain of the Funds and held by JPMorgan in its capacity as such Funds forward foreign currency counterparty will be retained by such Funds, and the Partnership will receive its allocable portion of such interest from the applicable Fund. Interest income earned by the Partnership for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 830,660 and 606,066, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower 4-week U.S. Treasury bill discount rates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Interest earned by the Partnership will increase the net asset value of the Partnership. The amount of interest income earned by the Partnership depends on (1) the average daily equity maintained in cash in the Partnership s and/or the Funds accounts, (2) the amount of U.S. Treasury bills and/or money market mutual fund securities held by the Partnership and/or the Funds and (3) interest rates over which none of the Partnership, the Funds, MS Co. or JPMorgan has control. Certain clearing fees are based on the number of trades executed by the Advisors for the Partnership/Funds. Accordingly, they must be compared in relation to the number of trades executed during the period. Clearing fees related to direct investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 11,254 and 88,238, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The decrease in these clearing fees was primarily due to a decrease in the number of direct trades made by the Partnership during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Ongoing selling agent fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted net asset value for Class A Redeemable Units as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Ongoing selling agent fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 131,674 and 296,580, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The decrease in ongoing selling agent fees was primarily due to lower average adjusted net assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Management fees, except fees payable to Transtrend, are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be compared in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Management fees payable to Transtrend are charged at the Transtrend Master level and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions of Transtrend Master. Management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 61,569 and 3,492, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The decrease in management fees was due to lower average adjusted net assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Fees are paid to the General Partner for administering the business and affairs of the Partnership including, among other things, (i) selecting, appointing and terminating the Partnership s commodity trading advisors, (ii) allocating and reallocating the Partnership s assets among the commodity trading advisors and (iii) monitoring the activities of the commodity trading advisors. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be compared in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. The General Partner fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 133,918 and 302,324, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The decrease in the General Partner fees was due to lower average adjusted net assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 25 

Incentive fees paid by the Partnership are based on the new trading profits, as defined in the respective management agreements among the Partnership, the General Partner/Trading Manager and each Advisor, generated by each Advisor at the end of the quarter, calendar half year or annually, as applicable. Trading performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in incentive fees of 0 and 1,013,156. Trading performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted in incentive fees of 0 and 172,212. To the extent an Advisor incurs a loss for the Partnership, the Advisor will not be paid an incentive fee until such Advisor recovers any net loss incurred by the Advisor and earns additional new trading profits for the Partnership. In allocating the assets of the Partnership among the Advisors, the General Partner considers, among other factors, each Advisor s past performance, trading style, volatility of markets traded and fee requirements. The General Partner may modify or terminate the allocation of assets among the Advisors and may allocate assets to additional advisors at any time. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Partnership s assets were allocated among the Advisors in the following approximate percentages:

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . The Partnership/Funds are speculative commodity pools. The market sensitive instruments held by the Partnership/Funds are acquired for speculative trading purposes, and all or substantially all of the Partnership s/Funds assets are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Partnership s/Funds main line of business. The limited partners will not be liable for losses exceeding the current net asset value of their investment. Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair value of the Partnership s/Funds open contracts and, consequently, in their earnings and cash balances. The Partnership s/Funds market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors. These primarily include factors which affect energy price levels, including supply factors and weather conditions, but could also include the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the Partnership s/Funds open contracts and the liquidity of the markets in which they trade. The Partnership/Funds rapidly acquire and liquidate both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will affect performance, and the Partnership s/Funds past performances is not necessarily indicative of their future results. Quantifying the Partnership s and the Funds Trading Value at Risk The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Partnership s and the Funds market risk exposures contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact. The Partnership and the Funds account for open positions on the basis of fair value accounting principles. Any loss in the market value of the Partnership s and each Fund s open positions is directly reflected in the Partnership s and each Fund s earnings and cash flow. The Partnership s and the Funds risk exposure in the market sectors traded by the Advisors is estimated below in terms of Value at Risk. Please note that the Value at Risk model is used to numerically quantify market risk for historic reporting purposes only and is not utilized by either the General Partner or the Advisors in their daily risk management activities. Value at Risk is a measure of the maximum amount which the Partnership/Funds could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty of the Partnership s/Funds speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Partnership/Funds of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated Value at Risk or the Partnership s/Funds experience to date (i.e., risk of ruin ). In light of the foregoing, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Partnership s/Funds losses in any market sector will be limited to Value at Risk or by the Partnership s/Funds attempts to manage their market risk. Exchange margin requirements have been used by the Partnership/Funds as the measure of their Value at Risk. Margin requirements are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum losses reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract in 95 -99 of any one-day interval. The margin levels are established by dealers and exchanges using historical price studies as well as an assessment of current market volatility (including the implied volatility of the options on a given futures contract) and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected near-term one-day price fluctuation. Value at Risk tables represent a probabilistic assessment of the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments. JSCL, Quantica, Breakout and Opus directly trade managed accounts in the name of the Partnership. As of September 30, 2024, Transtrend, Northlander and Drakewood traded the Partnership s assets indirectly in master fund managed accounts established in the name of the master funds over which they had been granted limited authority to make trading decisions. The first two trading Value at Risk tables reflect the market sensitive instruments held by the Partnership directly and through its investment in the Funds. The remaining trading Value at Risk tables reflect the market sensitive instruments held by the Partnership directly (i.e. in the managed accounts in the Partnership s name traded by JSCL, Quantica, Breakout and Opus) and indirectly by each Fund separately. There has been no material change in the trading Value at Risk information previously disclosed in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures . The Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership on the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods expected in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports it files is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Chief Financial Officer CFO of the General Partner, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and appropriate SEC filings. The General Partner is responsible for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures for the Partnership s external disclosures. The General Partner s President and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024 and, based on that evaluation, the General Partner s President and CFO have concluded that, at that date, the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The Partnership s internal control over financial reporting is a process under the supervision of the General Partner s President and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These controls include policies and procedures that: 

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Partnership; 

provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) the Partnership s receipts are handled and expenditures are made only pursuant to authorizations of the General Partner; and 

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection and correction of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Partnership s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. There were no changes in the Partnership s internal control over the financial reporting process during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.

 On June 1, 2011, Morgan Stanley Co. Incorporated converted from a Delaware corporation to a Delaware limited liability company. As a result of that conversion, Morgan Stanley Co. Incorporated is now named Morgan Stanley Co. LLC MS Co. or the Company ). 
 The Company is a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, a Delaware holding company. Morgan Stanley files periodic reports with the SEC as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act which include current descriptions of material litigation and material proceedings and investigations, if any, by governmental and/or regulatory agencies or self-regulatory organizations concerning Morgan Stanley and its subsidiaries, including the Company. As a consolidated subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, the Company does not file its own periodic reports with the SEC that contain descriptions of material litigation, proceedings and investigations. As a result, we refer you to the Legal Proceedings section of Morgan Stanley s SEC 10-K filings for 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019.

Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the third-party entities that are, or would otherwise be, the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt, in financial distress, or may not honor applicable indemnification obligations. These actions have included, but are not limited to, antitrust claims, claims under various false claims act statutes, and matters arising from our sales and trading businesses and our activities in the capital markets. 
 Each of Morgan Stanley and the Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the Company s business and involving, among other matters, sales, trading, financing, prime brokerage, market-making activities, investment banking advisory services, capital market activities, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten, or sold by the Company, wealth and investment management services, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, disgorgement, restitution, forfeiture, injunctions, limitations on our ability to conduct certain business, or other relief.

Table of Contents 
 During the preceding five years, the following administrative, civil, or criminal actions pending, on appeal or concluded against the Company or any of its principals are material within the meaning of CFTC Rule 4.24(l)(2) or 4.34(k)(2): 
 Regulatory and Governmental Matters 

 On January 12, 2024, the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York USAO and the SEC announced they had reached settlement agreements with the Company in connection with their investigations into the Company s blocks business. Specifically, the Company entered into a three-year non-prosecution agreement NPA with the USAO that included the payment of forfeiture, restitution, and a criminal fine for making false statements in connection with the sale of certain block trades from 2018 through August 2021. The NPA required the Company to admit responsibility for certain acts of its employees and to continue to cooperate with and provide certain information to the USAO for the term of the agreement. Additionally, the SEC charged the Company with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder for the disclosure of confidential information about block trades and also violations of Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act for the failure to enforce its policies concerning the misuse of material non-public information related to block trades. As part of the SEC agreement, the Company paid disgorgement and a civil penalty. After the agreed-upon credits were applied, the Company paid a total amount of approximately 249 million under both settlements. The Company also faces potential civil liability arising from claims that have been or may be asserted by, among others, block transaction participants who contend they were harmed or disadvantaged including, among other things, as a result of a share price decline allegedly caused by the activities of the Company and/or its employees, or as a result of the Company s and/or its employees failure to adhere to applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the Company has responded to demands from shareholders under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law for books and records concerning the investigations.

The order found that the Company improperly operated its equity swaps business without netting certain long and short positions as required by Rule 200(c) of Regulation SHO. The order found that the long exposure to an equity security (the Long Unit and the short exposure to an equity security (the Short Unit were not independent from one another and did not have separate trading strategies or objectives without regard to each other, and that the Long and Short Units were not eligible for the exception in Rule 200(f) of Regulation SHO.
