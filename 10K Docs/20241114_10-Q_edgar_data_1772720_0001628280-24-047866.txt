Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as anticipate, believe, could, expect, intend, may, opportunity, plan, predict, potential, estimate, should, will, would or the negative of these terms or other words of similar meaning. These statements are based upon the Company s current plans and strategies and reflect the Company s current assessment of the risks and uncertainties related to its business and are made as of the date of this report. These statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. You should read these statements carefully as they discuss our future expectations or state other forward-looking information. There may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control and our actual results may differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated include the following: 
 Uncertainties relating to the solar energy industry and the risk that sufficient additional demand for home solar energy systems may not develop or take longer to develop than we anticipate. 
 Disruptions to our solar monitoring systems could negatively impact our revenues and increase our expenses. 
 Warranties provided by the manufacturers of equipment for our assets and maintenance obligations may be inadequate to protect us. 
 The solar energy systems we own or may acquire may have a limited operating history and may not perform as we expect, including as a result of unsuitable solar and meteorological conditions. 
 Problems with performance of our solar energy systems may cause us to incur expenses, may lower the value of our solar energy systems and may damage our market reputation. 
 Developments in technology or improvements in distributed solar energy generation and related technologies or components may materially adversely affect demand for our offerings. 
 We could be harmed by a material reduction in the retail price of traditional utility generated electricity, electricity from other sources or renewable energy credits. 
 We may fail to grow by expanding our market penetration or to manage our growth effectively. 
 We may not enter into a definitive agreement to complete the Potential Acquisition, which is still subject to negotiation, the Potential Acquisition may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, and the Company may incur significant costs, fees and expenses related to the Potential Acquisition. 
 We may not be able to identify strategic acquisition or strategic relationship opportunities, we may not be able to complete strategic acquisitions or strategic relationships, or we may experience difficulties in integrating strategic acquisitions, including the Potential Acquisition if it is completed. 
 We may require additional financing to support the development of our business and implementation of our growth strategy. 
 We are subject to risks relating to our outstanding debt, including risks relating to rising interest rates and the risk that we may not have sufficient cash flow to pay our debt. 
 We may be adversely affected by the impact of natural disasters and other events beyond our control, such as hurricanes, wildfires or pandemics.

 home solar assets and customer contracts, making renewable energy more accessible to everyone. 
 The Company is engaged in the ownership and maintenance of home solar energy systems for homeowners in the U.S. The Company provides clean, solar energy typically at savings compared to traditional utility energy. The Company s primary customers are homeowners and the Company s core solar service offerings generate revenues primarily through (i) the sale of electricity generated by its home solar energy systems to homeowners pursuant to long-term agreements, which requires the Company s subscribers to make recurring monthly payments, (ii) third party contracts to sell solar renewable energy credits SRECs generated by the solar energy systems for fixed prices and (iii) the servicing of those agreements for other institutional owners of home solar energy systems. In addition, the Company generates cash flows and earns interest income from an investment through a master lease agreement described below. 
 
 The Company holds subsidiary fund companies, defined below as the Funds, that own and operate portfolios of home solar energy systems, which are subject to solar lease agreements SLAs and power purchase agreements PPAs , together with the SLAs, Customer Agreements with residential customers who benefit from the production of electricity generated by the solar energy systems. The solar energy systems may qualify for subsidies, renewable energy credits and other incentives as provided by various states and local agencies. These benefits have generally been retained by the Company's subsidiaries that own the systems, with the exception of the investment tax credit ITCs under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, which were generally passed through to the various financing partners of the solar energy systems. The Company also offers services which include asset management services and operating and maintenance services for home solar energy systems.

 SLA revenues Solar renewable energy credit revenues Government incentives Servicing revenues Intangibles amortization, unfavorable solar renewable energy agreements Other revenues Total 
 Energy generation 
 Customers purchase solar energy from the Company under PPAs or SLAs, both defined above. Revenue is recognized from contracts with customers as performance obligations are satisfied at a transaction price reflecting an amount of consideration based upon an estimated rate of return which is expressed as the solar rate per kilowatt hour or a flat rate per month as defined in the customer contracts. 
 PPA revenues - Under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB , PPA revenue is recognized when generated based upon the amount of electricity delivered as determined by remote monitoring equipment at solar rates specified under the PPAs. 
 SLA revenues - The Company has SLAs, which do not meet the definition of a lease under ASC 842, Leases , and are accounted for as contracts with customers under ASC 606. Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term as the obligation to provide continuous access to the solar energy system is satisfied. The amount of revenue recognized may not equal customer cash payments due to the performance obligation being satisfied ahead of cash receipt or evenly as continuous access to the solar energy system has been provided. The differences between revenue recognition and cash payments received are reflected as deferred rent assets on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Certain SLAs contain provisions to provide customers a performance guarantee that each solar energy system will achieve certain specified minimum solar energy production output. If the solar energy system does not produce the guaranteed production amount, the Company is obligated to pay a performance guarantee calculated as the product of (a) the shortfall production amount and (b) guaranteed rate per kWh as defined in the SLA. 
 Solar renewable energy credit revenues 
 The Company enters contracts with third parties to sell Solar Renewable Energy Credits ("SRECs") generated by the solar energy systems for fixed prices. Certain contracts that meet the definition of a derivative may be exempted as normal purchase or normal sales transactions ("NPNS"). NPNS are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of something other than a financial instrument or derivative instrument that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. Certain SREC contracts meet these requirements and are designated as NPNS contracts. Such SRECs are exempted from the derivative accounting and reporting requirements, and the Company recognizes revenues in accordance with ASC 606. The Company recognizes revenue for SRECs based on pricing predetermined within the respective contracts at a point in time when the SRECs are transferred. As SRECs can be sold separate from the actual electricity generated by the renewable-based generation source, the Company accounts for the SRECs it generates from its solar energy systems as governmental incentives and do not consider those SRECs output of the underlying solar energy systems. The Company classifies these SRECs as inventory held until sold and delivered to third parties. As the Company did not incur costs to obtain these governmental incentives, the inventory carrying value for the SRECs was as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 million and million, respectively. The Company recognized revenues of million related to deferred revenue as of the start of the period during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The Company did not recognize any tax related interest or penalties during the periods presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, however, would record any such interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes. 
 There has historically been no federal or state provision for income taxes since the Company has historically incurred net operating losses and maintains a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized provision for income taxes consistent with its losses incurred and the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company's effective income tax rate was for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 million, which consisted of cash payments of million less cash and restricted cash acquired of million. Management evaluated which entity should be considered the accounting acquirer in the transaction by giving consideration to the form of consideration transferred, the composition of the equity holders, the composition of voting rights of the Board of Directors, continuity of management structure, and size of the respective organizations. Based on the evaluation of the applicable factors, management noted that all factors, with the exception of the relative size of organization, were indicators that the Company was the acquiring entity resulting in management s conclusion that for accounting purposes, the Company acquired Legacy Spruce Power. 
 The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The Company allocated the Legacy Spruce Power purchase price to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values was recorded as goodwill. 
 The Company s evaluations of the facts and circumstances available as of the Acquisition Date, to assign fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, remained ongoing subsequent to the Acquisition Date. As the Company completed further analysis of assets including solar systems, intangible assets, as well as noncontrolling interests and non-recourse debt, additional information on the assets acquired and liabilities assumed became available. Changes in information related to the value of net assets acquired changed the amount of the purchase price initially assigned to goodwill, and as a result, the fair values set forth below were subject to adjustments as additional information was obtained and valuations completed. These provisional adjustments were recognized during the reporting period in which the adjustments were determined. The Company has finalized its purchase price allocation as of September 8, 2023. 
 Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the Acquisition Date, including the Company s estimates of the fair value of solar systems, production based incentives,

 As reflected in the preceding table, as a result of third party valuation reports received in the first quarter of 2023, the Company adjusted solar energy systems and intangible assets with corresponding changes to goodwill.

 The weighted-average useful life of the intangibles identified above is approximately years, which approximates the period over which the Company expects to gain the estimated economic benefits. 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the Company's ability to leverage and use its existing capital and access to capital markets along with Legacy Spruce Power's established operations and mergers and acquisition capabilities to grow the Spruce Power business.

 use rights to customer payment streams of approximately home SLAs and PPAs (the SEMTH Master Lease ). The Company acquired SEMTH for approximately million of cash, net of cash received, and assumed million of outstanding senior indebtedness under the SP4 Facility (See Note 8. Non-Recourse Debt) and interest rate swaps with Deutsche Bank AG, New York Bank held by SEMTH and its subsidiaries at the close of the acquisition. 
 The purchase of SEMTH's future revenue has been accounted for as an acquisition of financial assets. Under the acquisition method, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair value. All fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on significant estimates and assumptions, including Level 3 (unobservable) inputs, which require judgment. Estimates and assumptions include the projected timing and amount of future cash flows, discount rates reflecting risk inherent in future cash flows and future utility prices. 
 For the purposes of establishing the fair value of the Company's investment in the SEMTH Master Lease, its analysis considered cash flows beginning in March 2023 (the effective date of the transaction). The Company estimated the fair value of its investment in the SEMTH Master Lease to be approximately million on the transaction date. 
 Tredegar Acquisition 
 On August 18, 2023, the Company acquired approximately home solar assets and contracts from a publicly traded, regulated utility company for million (the Tredegar Acquisition ). The home solar assets acquired had an average remaining contract life of approximately years. The Tredegar Acquisition was funded by term loans from the concurrent amendment of the Company s existing debt facility as of the acquisition date. 
 The Tredegar Acquisition has been accounted for as an acquisition of assets, wherein the total consideration paid was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair value. The Company s determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on an independent third-party valuation, which involved significant estimates and assumptions, including Level 3 (unobservable) inputs, using the income method approach to value long-lived assets. The Company estimated the fair value of the Tredegar Acquisition to be approximately million, inclusive of transaction costs of million, of which million was allocated to the solar energy systems.

Note 10. 
 Remaining term in years Expected volatility Exercise price Fair value of common stock 
 The Company's interest rate swaps are not traded on a market exchange and the fair values are determined using a valuation model based on a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the interest rate swap agreements and uses observable market-based inputs, including estimated future SOFR interest rates. The fair value of the Company's interest rate swap is the net difference in the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on the expectation of future interest rates and are observable inputs available to a market participant. The interest rate swap valuation is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 The fair value of the Company s non-recourse debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively.

 The tax equity entities were structured at inception so that the allocations of income and loss for tax purposes will flip at a future date. The terms of the tax equity entities' operating agreements contain allocations of taxable income (loss), Section 48(a) ITCs and cash distributions that vary over time and adjust between the members on an agreed date (referred to as the flip date). The operating agreements specify either a certain flip date or an internal rate of return ("IRR") flip date. The certain flip date is based on the passage of a fixed period of time as defined in the operating agreements for each entity. The IRR flip date is the date on which the tax equity investor has achieved a contractual rate of return. From inception through the flip date, the Class A members' allocation of taxable income (loss) and Section 48(a) ITCs is generally and the Class B members' allocation of taxable income (loss) and Section 48(a) ITCs is generally . After the related flip date (or, if the tax equity investor has a deficit capital account, typically after such deficit has been eliminated), the Class A members' allocation of taxable income (loss) will typically decrease to (or, in some cases, a higher percentage if required by the tax equity investor) and the Class B members' allocation of taxable income (loss) will increase by an inverse amount.

We generate revenues primarily through the sale of electricity generated by our home solar energy systems to homeowners pursuant to long-term agreements that obligate our subscribers to make recurring monthly payments, and the servicing of those agreements for other institutional owners of home solar energy systems. In addition, we also earn interest income from the investment made under the master lease with SS Holdings 2017, LLC and its subsidiaries ("SEMTH"). 
 Corporate Strategy 
 Our corporate strategy has three key elements: 
 Leveraging the Spruce Power platform to become a leading provider of subscription-based solutions for distributed energy resources 
 We have more than a decade of experience owning and operating rooftop solar systems, as well as energy efficiency upgrades. We believe our proven platform for managing home solar can be extended to other categories of distributed energy resources, and by leveraging our platform, we intend to grow our revenues by providing subscription-based solutions for rooftop solar and energy storage and other future energy-related products to homeowners and businesses, including commercial and industrial C I solar developers. We are focused on delivering best-in-class customer service, with investment into process and platform improvement for on-site monitoring, customer billing and working with qualified partners for field services. 
 Profitably growing return on assets by focusing on channels with the lowest customer acquisition cost 
 We seek to grow our subscriber revenues by focusing on those channels that have lowest customer acquisition costs and the ability to increase return on assets, including acquiring existing systems from other companies or investment funds, selling additional services to existing subscribers, selling services to new customers online and partnering with selected independent installers to provide a subscription-based solution for their customers. During the three months ended

 September 30, 2024, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent to acquire a portfolio of approximately 10,000 home solar assets and contracts (the Potential Acquisition ), which if completed would bring ownership of total home solar assets and contracts to approximately 85,000. While management is pursuing the Potential Acquisition, there is no guarantee that we will complete the intended acquisition. 
 Increasing shareholder value by delivering predictable revenues, profits and cash flow 
 By focusing on subscription-based solutions with long-term customer contracts, we seek to generate consistent revenues, profits and cash flow. 
 Key Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 We are a leading owner and operator of distributed solar energy assets across the United States, offering subscription-based solutions to homeowners for rooftop solar energy storage and other energy-related products. Additionally, we provide servicing functions for our assets and customers, as well as for other institutional owners of home solar energy systems. Our operating results and ability to grow its business over time could be impacted by certain factors and trends that affect our industry, as well as elements of our strategy, such as: 
 Development of Distributed Energy Assets 
 Our future growth depends significantly on our ability to acquire operating home solar energy systems in-bulk from other companies. Industry data suggests there is a substantial existing base of operating home solar energy systems, providing us opportunities to pursue acquisitions. Over the long-term, the continued ability to pursue acquisitions is dependent on development of distributed energy assets, namely home solar energy systems, by third parties. This development may be impacted by numerous factors that influence homeowner demand for home solar energy systems including but not limited to macroeconomic dynamics, climate change impacts, and government policy and incentives. 
 Availability of Financing 
 Our ability to raise capital from third parties at reasonable terms is a critical element in supporting ownership of our existing home solar energy assets as well as enabling our future growth. We have historically utilized non-recourse, project-level debt as a primary source of capital for acquisitions. Our ability to raise debt either as means to refinance existing indebtedness or for future acquisitions may be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions, the health of debt capital markets, the interest rate environment, and general concerns over its industry or specific concerns over its business. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 The results of operations related to our Drivetrain and XL Grid businesses, which were determined to be discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2022, are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. As a result, the continuing operational results reflect the operations related to our corporate functions and the results of operations for Legacy Spruce Power since its acquisition on September 9, 2022.

 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Information with respect to our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented below: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (In thousands, except per share and share amounts) 2024 2023 Change Change Revenues 21,378 23,250 (1,872) (8) Operating expenses: Cost of revenues 9,657 9,810 (153) (2) Selling, general and administrative expenses 13,521 12,391 1,130 9 Litigation settlements, net 7,205 26,339 (19,134) (73) Gain on asset disposal (603) (773) 170 (22) Impairment of goodwill 28,757 28,757 Loss from operations (37,159) (24,517) (12,642) 52 Other (income) expense: Interest income (6,265) (8,255) 1,990 (24) Interest expense, net 11,367 11,192 175 2 Other (income) expense, net 11,289 (8,491) 19,780 (233) Net loss from continuing operations (53,550) (18,963) (34,587) 182 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (4) (204) 200 (98) Net loss (53,554) (19,167) (34,387) 179 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests (25) 146 (171) (117) Net loss attributable to stockholders (53,529) (19,313) (34,216) 177 Net loss per common share: Basic and diluted (2.88) (1.11) (1.77) 159 
 Revenues and Cost of Revenues 
 Revenues decreased by 1.9 million, or 8.1 , to 21.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 23.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in SREC revenues and a decrease in SLA revenue primarily due to higher performance guarantee obligations recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Cost of revenues decreased by less than 0.2 million, or 1.6 , to 9.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower cost of operations and maintenance in the current period. Cost of revenues related to our Drivetrain and XL Grid operations are included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 1.1 million, or 9.1 , to 13.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 12.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to various factors including an increase in legal fees incurred in connection with our legal settlements and other ongoing legal proceedings (See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies) and an increase in compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior period. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 include the ongoing operations of our home solar business and corporate functions, as

 well as certain remaining costs associated with our historic operations, including certain integration related costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses related to the Drivetrain and XL Grid operations are included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations. 
 Litigation settlement, net 
 Litigation settlement, net decreased by 19.1 million, or 72.6 , to 7.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 26.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributed to 26.0 million incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023, associated with settlements of the SEC inquiry and shareholder lawsuits, net of related insurance recoveries from third parties, partially offset by 7.2 million in additional settlement costs associated with various settled and ongoing legal proceedings (See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies) recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Impairment of Goodwill 
 Impairment of goodwill of 28.8 million was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to a continuous decline in our stock price and market capitalization. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income decreased by 2.0 million, or 24.1 , to 6.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to additional interest income of 2.4 million associated with the SEMTH Master Lease recognized in the prior period, slightly offset by a 0.4 million decrease in interest income earned on investments in U.S. Treasury securities during the current period. 
 Other (Income) Expense, net 
 Other (income) expense, net was a 11.3 million expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 19.8 million from an income of 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily the result of change in fair value of our interest rate swap agreements. 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Information with respect to our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented below:

 Revenues and Cost of Revenues 
 Revenues decreased by 2.3 million, or 3.5 , to 61.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 64.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in SREC revenue and a decrease in SLA revenue primarily due to higher performance guarantee obligations recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in PPA revenues in the current period related to the Tredegar Acquisition. 
 Cost of revenues increased by 2.2 million , or 8.5 , to 28.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 26.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in certain operation and maintenance costs. Cost of revenues related to our Drivetrain and XL Grid operations are included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 0.7 million, or 1.5 , to 43.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 44.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 include the ongoing operations of our home solar business and corporate functions, as well as certain remaining costs associated with our historic operations, including certain integration related costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses related to the Drivetrain and XL Grid operations are included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations.

Table of Contents 

 Litigation settlement, net decreased by 19.1 million, or 72.6 , to 7.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 26.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributed to 26.0 million incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 associated with settlements of the SEC inquiry and shareholder lawsuits, net of related insurance recoveries from third parties, partially offset by 7.2 million in additional settlement costs associated with various settled and ongoing legal proceedings (See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies) recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Gain on Asset Disposal 
 Gain on asset disposal decreased by less than 2.2 million, or 51.4 , to 2.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily the result of updated valuation reports and adjustments to provisional amounts assigned to gain on asset disposal recognized in the prior period, partially offset by a 0.2 million gain recognized in the current period for insurance proceeds related to Maui wildfire. 
 Impairment of Goodwill 
 Impairment of goodwill of 28.8 million was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a continuous decline in our stock price and market capitalization. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income increased by 3.1 million, or 22.1 , to 16.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to three full quarters of interest income related to the SEMTH Acquisition, which was completed in March 2023, recognized in the current period as compared to the prior period. 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Interest expense, net decreased by 0.9 million, or 3.0 , to 29.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 30.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a gain recognized during the current period due to settlement of our interest rate swaps related to the repayment of SP4 Facility, partially offset by incremental expenses associated with three full quarters of interest expense related to the SP4 Facility assumed in connection with the SEMTH acquisition completed in 2023. 
 Other (Income) Expense, net 
 Other (income) expense, net was 7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 20.8 million from income of 13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to an unfavorable change in the value of interest swaps in the current period.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our cash requirements depend on many factors, including the execution of our business strategy. We remain focused on carefully managing costs, including capital expenditures, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and ensuring adequate liquidity. Our primary cash needs are for debt service, acquisition of solar systems, operating expenses, working capital and capital expenditures to support the growth of our business. Working capital is impacted by the timing and extent of the business needs. As of September 30, 2024, we had net working capital of 110.2 million, including cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 150.0 million. 
 With the acquisition of Legacy Spruce Power in September 2022, we assumed all of the outstanding non-recourse debt of Legacy Spruce Power, which had a principal balance of 542.5 million o n the date of the acquisition. With the SEMTH acquisition in the first quarter of 2023, we assumed 125.0 million of non-recourse debt, which was repaid in full in June 2024, see Note 8. Non-Recourse Debt to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q . During the third quarter of 2023, we entered into a second amendment to our existing SP2 Facility, resulting in incremental term loans of approximately 21.4 million, proceeds of which were used to primarily fund the Tredegar acquisition. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we obtained new term loans in the aggregate principal amount of 130.0 million , the proceeds of which were primarily used to repay 125.0 million related to the SEMTH acquisition. As of September 30, 2024 , we had 605.4 million of aggregate non-recourse debt, including current portions. We are required to complete debt service coverage ratio calculations on a quarterly basis as part of our debt covenants. All debt covenant requirements were satisfied as of September 30, 2024. Based on our current liquidity, management believes that no additional capital will be needed to execute its current business plan over the next 12 months. We continually evaluate our cash needs to raise additional funds or seek alternative sources to invest in growth opportunities and other purposes.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the U.S. as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standards Codification, and we evaluate the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the consolidated balance sheet date, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Our significant accounting policies are consistent with those discussed in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the consolidated financial statements and the MD A sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 The Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 controls and procedures were not effective as of that date, due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. These deficiencies could result in misstatements to the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements that would be material and would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 As previously disclosed under Item 9A Controls and Procedures in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, management concluded that the Company did not maintain an effective control environment based on the criteria established in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO Framework, and its relevant components, which resulted in deficiencies that constitute material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate. 
 Control Environment 
 The Company failed to maintain a sufficient complement of qualified personnel to perform control activities. The lack of sufficient appropriately qualified personnel contributed to our failure to: (i) design and implement certain risk-mitigating internal controls; and (ii) consistently operate our internal controls. The control environment material weaknesses contributed to material weaknesses within our system of internal control over financial reporting in the Control Activities component of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO Framework. 
 Control Activities 
 The Company did not maintain effective control activities based on the criteria established in the COSO Framework and identified the following control deficiencies that constitute material weaknesses from the lack of effectively designed and implemented controls, either individually or in the aggregate: 
 review and approval of manual journal entries, including implementing appropriate segregation of duties; 
 complex transactions, inclusive of accounting for business combinations and the Company s investment related to the SEMTH Master Lease Agreement and the related interest income; and 
 revenue recognition, including the review of the contracts upon inception and/or acquisition and the accounting for revenue recognition under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . 
 These deficiencies in control activities contributed to the potential for there to have been material accounting errors in multiple financial statement account balances and disclosures that would not have been prevented or detected timely. 
 However, after giving full consideration to these material weaknesses, and the additional analyses and other procedures that were performed to ensure that the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were prepared in accordance with GAAP, management has concluded that our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods disclosed in conformity with GAAP. 
 Remediation Plan 
 The Company is committed to maintaining strong internal control over financial reporting. In response to the material weaknesses described above, management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee, has taken and is taking comprehensive actions to remediate the above material weaknesses. The remediation plan includes the following: 
 developed and presented a training program educating control owners concerning financial statement risk and the principles of the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by COSO; 
 implemented a formal journal entry review policy to govern the process by which all manual journal entry approvers would adhere to; 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 implemented a system-based journal entry approval workflow to ensure manual journal entries have proper segregation of duties between journal entry creators and approvers; 
 hiring professionals with the appropriate skills to perform control activities, including those involving complex and/or non-routine transactions; 
 designing and implementing additional and/or enhanced controls in the areas of account reconciliations, contract accounting, revenue recognition, and financial statement analysis prepared in conformity with GAAP, and manual journal entries; and 
 designing and implementing controls to address the identification, accounting, review and reporting of complex and/or non-routine transactions. 
 While management believes that these efforts will improve the Company's internal control over financial reporting, the implementation of these measures is ongoing and will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles. 
 Management believes the Company is making progress toward achieving the effectiveness of its internal controls and disclosure controls. The actions that management is taking are subject to ongoing management review, as well as Audit Committee oversight. Management will continue to assess the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting and take steps to remediate the known material weaknesses expeditiously. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Legal Proceedings in Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties relating to the Company's business disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as described below. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations. 
 Our performance may be negatively impacted by our recent Chief Executive Officer transition 
 On April 12, 2024, we announced that our Chairman, Christopher Hayes, had been named President and Chief Executive Officer to replace our Former CEO. There are a number of risks associated with a CEO transition, any of which may harm the Company. If the new CEO is unsuccessful at leading the management team or is unable to articulate and execute the Company s strategy and vision, our business may be harmed, and our stock price may decline. If we do not successfully manage our CEO transition, it could be viewed negatively by our customers, employees or investors and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results. With the change in leadership, there is a risk to retention of other members of senior management, as well as to continuity of business initiatives, plans, and strategies through the transition period and if we are unable to execute an orderly transition, our business may be adversely affected. 
 We are subject to risks associated with proxy contests and other actions of activist stockholders. 
 
 Publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by activist investors advocating corporate actions such as governance changes, financial restructurings, increased borrowings, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or entire companies to third parties or the activists themselves. We received a notice dated April 17, 2024 from Clayton Capital Appreciation Fund, L.P. and its affiliates, Clayton Partners LLC, the JSCC Family Trust, and Jason Stankowski (collectively, Clayton ), which owned approximately 2.1 of the Company s outstanding shares at the time of submission, purporting to nominate a slate of two candidates for election as directors at our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. On June 21, 2024, we entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Clayton (the Cooperation Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to increase the size of our Board from six to seven directors and to take all necessary actions to appoint Clara Nagy McBane to our Board to fill the directorship resulting from the increase in the size of our Board and Clayton agreed to certain customary standstill provisions that will remain in effect until the date that is the earlier of (i) the date Clayton receives notice that we will not nominate Ms. McBane for re-election to our Board at the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (ii) immediately following the closing of the polls on the election of directors at the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (iii) August 31, 2025 if the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders has not been held by that date, and (iv) in the event that any party materially breaches the Cooperation Agreement, the date that is 30 calendar days following written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party, if such breach (if capable of being cured) has not been cured by such date, or, if impossible to cure within 30 calendar days, such party has not taken substantive action to correct by such date. A proxy contest or related activities on the part of activist stockholders could adversely affect our business for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, the following: 
 responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of our Board of Directors, management and our employees; 
 perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners, customers and others important to our success, any of which could negatively affect our business and our results of operations and financial condition; 
 actions by activist stockholders may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel; 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 if nominees advanced by activist stockholders are elected or appointed to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plans or to realize long-term value from our assets, and this could in turn have an adverse effect on our business and on our results of operations and financial condition; and 
 proxy contests may cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility. 
 We have received subpoenas from states attorneys general requesting information about our business. These investigations could result in substantial legal fees, fines, penalties or damages and may divert Management s time and attention from our business 
 
 We have received subpoenas from state attorneys general requesting information about our business.

Specifically, we have received subpoenas from the attorneys general for the states of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Texas regarding, among other things, our sales, marketing and billing practices. We are cooperating with these investigations, each of which have involved requests for a substantial volume of documents to be produced by the Company. While we are responding to these subpoenas with the assistance of counsel, it is possible that these investigations may result in a fine, penalty or injunction which may adversely affect our ability to operate in these states.
