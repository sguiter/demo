 FINANCIAL SUMMARY Index to Notes 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Financial Summary 
 
 Third quarter 2024 included the following notable items: 
 
 GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) were 1.85. 
 Total revenue was 25.7 billion, an increase of 1.1 percent from the comparable prior-year period, reflecting a total sales increase of 0.9 percent and a 11.5 percent increase in other revenue. 
 Comparable sales increased 0.3 percent, reflecting a 2.4 percent increase in traffic and a 2.0 percent decrease in average transaction amount. 
 Comparable stores-originated sales declined 1.9 percent. 
 Comparable digitally-originated sales increased 10.8 percent. 
 Operating income of 1.2 billion was 11.2 percent lower than the comparable prior-year period. 
 
 Earnings Per Share Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Change November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Change GAAP and Adjusted EPS 1.85 2.10 (11.9) 6.45 5.96 8.3 
 Note: Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP metric, excludes the impact of certain items when applicable. However, there are no adjustments in any period presented. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our operations. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provid ed on page 19 . 
 
 We report after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) because we believe ROIC provides a meaningful measure of our capital allocation effectiveness over time. For the trailing twelve months ended November 2, 2024, after-tax ROIC was 15.9 percent , compared with 13.9 percent for the trailing twelve months ended October 28, 2023. The calculation of ROIC is provided on page 20 .

 Note: Gross margin rate is calculated as gross margin (sales less cost of sales) divided by sales. All other rates are calculated by dividing the applicable amount by total revenue. 

Sales 
 
 Sales include all merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and our estimate of gift card breakage. We use comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months, stores that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Digitally originated sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites. Our stores fulfill the majority of digitally originated sales, including shipment from stores to guests, store Order Pickup or Drive Up, and delivery via Shipt. Digitally originated sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers, our vendors, or other third parties. 
 
 Sales growth from both comparable sales and new stores represents an important driver of our long-term profitability. We expect that comparable sales growth will drive the majority of our total sales growth. We believe that our ability to successfully differentiate our guests shopping experience through a careful combination of merchandise assortment, price, convenience, guest experience, and other factors will, over the long-term, drive both increasing shopping frequency (number of transactions, or "traffic") and the amount spent each visit (average transaction amount).

We monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using Target Circle Cards (Target Circle Card Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on Target Circle Cards are also incremental sales for Target. Guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases when they use a Target Circle Card at Target. For the three months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, total Target Circle Card Penetration was 17.7 percent and 18.3 percent, respectively. For the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, total Target Circle Card Penetration was 17.8 percent and 18.6 percent, respectively. 

Gross Margin Rate 
 
 Quarter-to-Date 

Year-to-Date 

For the three months ended November 2, 2024, our gross margin rate was 27.2 percent compared with 27.4 percent in the comparable prior-year period. For the nine months ended November 2, 2024, our gross margin rate was 27.9 percent compared with 26.9 percent in the comparable prior-year period. For both the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024, the changes reflected the net impact of 
 higher digital fulfillment supply chain costs due to 
 costs of managing elevated inventory levels during the third quarter, including the impact of receipt timing; 
 an increase in digital volume; and 
 new supply chain facilities coming online; 
 lower book to physical inventory adjustments compared to the prior-year period; and 
 merchandising activities, including cost improvements which more than offset higher promotional and clearance markdown rates.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expense Rate 
 
 For the three months ended November 2, 2024, our SG A expense rate was 21.4 percent compared with 20.9 percent for the comparable prior-year period. For the nine months ended November 2, 2024, our SG A expense rate was 21.2 percent compared with 20.6 percent for the comparable prior-year period. The increases reflected the net impact of cost increases across our business, including higher team member pay and benefits and higher general liability expenses, partially offset by the benefit of lower store remodel-related expenses.

Other Performance Factors 
 
 Net Interest Expense 
 
 N et interest expense was 105 million and 321 million for the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024, respectively, compared with 107 million and 395 million in the comparable prior-year periods. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in interest income. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 Our effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024, were 21.7 percent and 22.5 percent, respectively, compared with 21.3 percent and 21.5 percent in the comparable prior-year periods. The increase in both periods reflects the impact of lower discrete tax benefits compared to the prior-year.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures 
 
 To provide additional transparency, we disclose non-GAAP Adjusted EPS. When applicable, this metric excludes certain discretely managed items. However, there are no adjustments in any period presented. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share. Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EPS differently, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

Earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) and earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures provide meaningful information about our operational efficiency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of differences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels, and, for EBITDA, capital investment. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is net earnings. EBIT and EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate EBIT and EBITDA differently, limiting the usefulness of the measures for comparisons with other companies.

We have also disclosed after-tax ROIC, which is a ratio based on GAAP information, with the exception of the add-back of operating lease interest to operating income. We believe this metric is useful in assessing the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time.

 ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION Index to Notes 

Analysis of Financial Condition 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Capital Allocation 
 
 We follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities, ranked in order of importance: first, we fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business, create sustainable long-term value, and maintain our current operations and assets; second, we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually; and finally, we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals. 
 
 Our cash and cash equivalents balance was 3.4 billion, 3.8 billion, and 1.9 billion as of November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024, and October 28, 2023, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents balance includes short-term investments of 2.5 billion, 2.9 billion, and 1.0 billion as of November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024, and October 28, 2023, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly-rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments. 
 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities were 4.1 billion and 5.3 billion for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, and October 28, 2023, respectively. The operating cash flow decrease is primarily due to increased inventory levels and slightly lower accounts payable leverage, in addition to higher income tax and incentive compensation payments. 
 
 Inventory 
 
 Inventory was 15.2 billion as of November 2, 2024, compared with 11.9 billion and 14.7 billion as of February 3, 2024, and October 28, 2023, respectively. The increase from February 3, 2024, primarily reflects the seasonal inventory build ahead of the November and December holiday sales period. The increase from October 28, 2023, primarily reflects the impact of lower-than-expected sales in certain discretionary categories during the three months ended November 2, 2024, as well as an improved in-stock position. 
 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 
 Cash required for investing activities decreased to 1.9 billion for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 3.9 billion for the nine months ended October 28, 2023, due to lower capital investments. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 We paid dividends totaling 516 million 1.12 per share) and 1.5 billion 3.32 per share) for the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024, respectively, and 507 million 1.10 per share) and 1.5 billion 3.26 per share) for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2023, respectively, a per share increase of 1.8 percent. We declared dividends totaling 521 million 1.12 per share) during the third quarter of 2024 and 513 million 1.10 per share) during the third quarter of 2023, a per share increase of 1.8 percent. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. 
 
 Share Repurchase 
 
 We deployed 509 million to repurchase shares during the nine months ended November 2, 2024. See Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 8 to the Financial Statements for more information.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Table of Contents 
 ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION Index to Notes 

Financing 
 
 Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities, and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of November 2, 2024, our credit ratings were as follows: 
 
 Credit Ratings Moody s Standard and Poor s Fitch Long-term debt A2 A A Commercial paper P-1 A-1 F1 
 
 If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically, and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above. 
 
 In September 2024, we issued 750 million of debt. Note 6 to the Financial Statements provides additional information. 
 
 We have the ability to obtain short-term financing from time to time under our commercial paper program and credit facilities. In October 2024, we obtained a new committed 1.0 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in October 2025 and terminated our prior 364-day credit facility. This credit facility and our 3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in October 2028 backstop our commercial paper program. No balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2024 or 2023. There was no commercial paper outstanding as of either November 2, 2024 or October 28, 2023. Note 6 to the Financial Statements provides additional information. 
 
 Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facilities also contain a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, as of November 2, 2024, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade. 
 
 We believe our sources of liquidity, namely operating cash flows, credit facility capacity, and access to capital markets, will continue to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations, working capital, and planned capital expenditures, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 We do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on our financial statements.

 ARTICLE 8 CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES 
 Section 8.01 Inability to Determine Rates . 
 (a) If in connection with any request for a Term SOFR Loan or a conversion of Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans or a continuation of any of such Loans, as applicable, (i) the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (A) no Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with Section 8.01(b) , and the circumstances under clause (i) of Section 8.01(b) or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred, or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (ii) the Agent or the Required Banks determine that for any reason that Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding such Loan, the Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Bank. 
 Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Banks to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans, or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Banks described in clause (ii) of this Section 8.01(a) , until the Agent upon instruction of the Required Banks) revokes such notice. 
 38 

Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, or conversion to, or continuation of Term SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, shall be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding Term SOFR Loans shall be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans immediately at the end of their respective applicable Interest Period. 
 (b) Replacement of Term SOFR or Successor Rate . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Banks notify the Agent (with, in the case of the Required Banks, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Banks (as applicable) have determined, that 
 (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining one month, three month and six-month interest periods of Term SOFR, including, without limitation, because the Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or 
 (ii) CME or any successor administrator of the Term SOFR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Agent or such administrator with respect to its publication of Term SOFR, in each case acting in such capacity, has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of Dollar denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Agent, that will continue to provide such representative interest periods of Term SOFR after such specific date (the latest date on which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer representative or available permanently or indefinitely, the Scheduled Unavailability Date 
 then, on a date and time determined by the Agent (any such date, the Term SOFR Replacement Date ), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, Term SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan Document with Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the Successor Rate ). 
 If the Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment, all interest payments will be payable on a quarterly basis. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if the Agent determines that Daily Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the Term SOFR Replacement Date, or (ii) if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 8.01(b)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, the Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing Term SOFR or any then current Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 8.01 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for 
 39 

interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar Dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such alternative benchmark. and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar Dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmark. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments, shall constitute a Successor Rate . Any such amendment shall become effective at 5 00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Banks and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Banks comprising the Required Banks have delivered to the Agent written notice that such Required Banks object to such amendment. 
 The Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Bank of the implementation of any Successor Rate. 
 Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Agent. 
 Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than 0.00 , the Successor Rate shall be deemed to be 0.00 for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Banks reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. 
 For purposes of this Section 8.01 , those Banks that either have not made, or do not have an obligation under this Agreement to make, the relevant Loans in Dollars shall be excluded from any determination of Required Banks. 
 Section 8.02 Illegality . If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable Law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable Law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by any Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Loans whose interest rate is determined by reference to SOFR or Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR or Term SOFR, and such Bank shall so notify the Agent, the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (a) the obligation of such Bank to make or continue Term SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans shall be suspended and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Bank making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Bank shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Bank notifies the Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for 
 40 

giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Term SOFR Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall immediately prepay in full the then outstanding principal amount of each such Term SOFR Loan, together with accrued interest thereon. Concurrently with prepaying each such Term SOFR Loan, the Borrower shall, subject to Section 2.01 , borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Term SOFR Loans of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan. 
 Section 8.03 Increased Cost and Reduced Return . If on or after the date hereof in the case of any Loan or any obligation to make Loans, the adoption of any applicable Law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable Law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by any Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority 
 (i) shall subject any Bank (or its Lending Office) to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its Term SOFR Loans, its Note, if any, or its obligation to make Term SOFR Loans, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Bank (or its Lending Office) of the principal of or interest on its Term SOFR Loans or any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect of its Term SOFR Loans or its obligation to make Term SOFR Loans (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Bank or its Lending Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Bank s principal executive office or Lending Office is located) and except for any U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed under FATCA or
