Following the Conversion, voting rights in the Company are held and exercised exclusively by the shareholders of the Company. Deposit account holders continue to be insured by the FDIC. The Bank may not pay a dividend on its capital stock if the effect thereof would cause retained earnings to be reduced below regulatory capital requirements. In addition, the Company is subject to certain regulations related to the payment of dividends and the repurchase of its capital stock. The Conversion was accounted for as a change in corporate form with the historic basis of the Bank s assets, liabilities and equity unchanged as a result. The Bank, which is the sole subsidiary of the Company, is a federally chartered mutual thrift engaged primarily in the business of making residential mortgage loans, commercial loans and accepting deposits. Its operations are conducted through its offices located in Van Wert, Ohio and Fort Wayne, Indiana. The Bank faces competition from other financial institutions and is subject to the regulation of certain federal and state agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. The Bank has elected to operate as a covered savings association CSA ).

 and , respectively, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. The past due status of a loan is based on the contractual terms in the loan agreement. The accrual of interest on a loan is discontinued when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent or whenever management believes the borrower will be unable to make payments as they become due. When loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is subsequently accounted for on the cash basis if collection of the remaining recorded investment in the loan is still expected or using the cost-recovery method when collection of the remaining recorded investment is in doubt. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. For loans amortized at cost, interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, as well as premiums and discounts, are deferred and amortized as a level yield adjustment over the respective term of the loan. For all loan portfolio segments except residential and consumer loans, the Bank promptly charges-off loans, or portions thereof, when available information confirms that specific loans are uncollectible based on information that includes, but is not limited to, (1) the deteriorating financial condition of the borrower, (2) declining collateral values, and/or (3) legal action, including bankruptcy, that impairs the borrower s ability to adequately meet its obligations. For impaired loans that are considered to be solely collateral dependent, a partial charge-off is recorded when a loss has been confirmed by an updated appraisal or other appropriate valuation of the collateral. The Bank charges-off residential and consumer loans, or portions thereof, when the Bank reasonably determines the amount of the loss. The Bank adheres to delinquency thresholds established by applicable regulatory guidance to determine the charge-off timeframe for these loans. Loans at these delinquency thresholds for which the Bank can clearly document that the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection, such that collection will occur regardless of delinquency status, need not be charged off. For all classes, all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the timely collection of interest or principal. The Bank requires a period of satisfactory performance of not less than six months before returning a nonaccrual loan to accrual status. When cash payments are received on impaired loans in each loan class, the Bank records the payment as interest income unless collection of the remaining recorded principal amount is doubtful, at which time payments are used to reduce the principal balance of the loan.

 > Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital > Total Risk-Based Capital > Tier 1 Leverage Capital > On November 13, 2019, the federal regulators finalized and adopted a regulatory capital rule establishing a new community bank leverage ratio (CBLR), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The intent of the CBLR is to provide a simple alternative measure of capital adequacy for electing qualifying depository institutions and depository institution holding companies, as directed under the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. If a qualifying depository institution, or depository institution holding company, elects to use such measure, such institution or holding company will be considered well capitalized if its ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets (i.e., leverage ratio) exceeds 9 percent, subject to a limited two quarter grace period, during which the leverage ratio cannot go basis points below the then applicable threshold, and will not be required to calculate and report risk-based capital ratios. The Bank s CBLR was percent as of June 30, 2024. Management believes, as of June 30, 2024, that the Company met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.

There are liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended June 30, 2024. Available-for-sale Securities Where quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent asset pricing services and pricing models, the inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prepayments, defaults, cumulative loss projections and cash flows. Such securities are classified in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. The Company had Level 3 securities. Nonrecurring Measurements At September 30, 2024, the Company had loans measured at fair value with a carrying value of , which are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the loans are estimated using third-party appraisals of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell. The Company had assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at June 30, 2024. The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments not carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 are as follows:

These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Fair value estimates may not be realizable in an immediate settlement of the instrument. In some instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company s various financial instruments, in which case fair values may be based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques, or based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristic of the financial instruments, or other factors. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimate of future cash flows. Subsequent changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market area, which are worse than expected; inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, the fair value of our financial instruments, or our level of loan originations, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments within our loan portfolio; changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; our ability to access cost-effective funding; fluctuations in real estate values and in the conditions of the residential real estate, commercial real estate, and agricultural real estate markets; our ability to control cost and expenses, particularly those associated with operating a publicly traded company; demand for loans and deposits in our market area; our ability to implement and change our business strategies; competition among depository and other financial institutions; adverse changes in the securities markets; changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees, capital requirements and insurance premiums; changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios; technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; the inability of third-party providers to perform as expected; a failure or breach of our operational or information security systems or infrastructure, including cyberattacks; our ability to manage market risk, credit risk and operational risk; our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;

 changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; our ability to retain key employees; material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal controls over financial reporting; our ability to control costs when hiring employees in a highly competitive environment; and changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own. 
 Because of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Critical Accounting Estimates Significant accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could reflect materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Methodologies the Company uses when applying critical accounting policies and developing critical estimates are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. Our accounting policies for credit losses, investment securities, and income taxes comprise those that management believes involve the most critical estimates and aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. There were no material changes from the significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fair Value Measurements . The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Van Wert Federal estimates the fair value of a financial instrument and any related asset impairment using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, we estimate fair value. These estimates are subjective in nature and imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of gain or loss recorded. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 Total Assets. Total assets were 318.7 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.4 million, or 2.4 , from June 30, 2024. The increase is part of the continued execution of the strategic plan by management to add higher yielding variable rate interest earning assets using fixed rate funding to offset the liability sensitive nature of the balance sheet. The increase was comprised mainly of 27.9 million in securities, 7.7 million in loans, offset by a decrease of 27.6 million in cash. Cash and Due from Banks. Cash and due from banks decrease by 27.6 million, or -87.1 , to 4.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 31.6 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was due primarily to the payoff of the overnight Cash Management Advance CMA line with FHLB at June 30, 2024. Investment Securities. Investment securities increased 27.9 million, or 20.0 , to 167.2 million at September 30, 2024, from 139.3 million at June 30, 2024. Aggregate securities purchases of 34.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, were partially offset by 8.2 million of calls, maturities and repayments, as well as a 977,000 increase in fair value of the securities over the period. The yield on investment securities was 5.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the increase in market interest rates during the period, as well as the addition of higher yielding securities . The increase in investment securities is part of a forward-looking investment strategy to increase the number of variable rate investments financed by fixed rate deposit instruments, such as brokered certificates of deposits noted in the deposit section below, which will ultimately provide a more balanced interest rate risk profile. The increase is also part of an effort to more appropriately leverage the Company s capital.

Table of Contents 
 The 977,000 increase in the fair value of the investment securities was primarily attributable to the variability in market interest rates. As market interest rates decrease, the fair value of the securities increases. The unrealized losses are recorded to shareholders equity, net of tax, as management has determined that there are no credit quality concerns with the issuers of the securities and there is no intent to sell the securities and, as a result, the fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity dates. Net Loans. Net loans increased by 7.7 million, or 6.1 , to 134.1 million at September 30, 2024, from 126.4 million at June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, loan originations totaled 6.1 million, comprised of 3.9 million of loans secured by one-to-four family residential real estate, 302,000 of HELOCs, 158,000 of consumer loans, 1.3 million of commercial and industrial loans, and 398,000 in commercial. Increases in loan balances reflect our strategy to grow our loan portfolio, continuing to focus on owner-occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans, while increasing our emphasis on commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans. Management intends to continue to pursue growth in these loan segments in future periods. Deposits. Deposits increased by 35.8 million, or 17.1 , to 245.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 209.3 million at June 30, 2024. Core deposits (defined as all deposits other than brokered deposits) increased 18.9 million, or 15.1 , to 144.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 125.2 million at June 30, 2024. Brokered Certificates of deposit increased 22.3 million, or 26.5 , to 106.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 84.1 million at June 30, 2024. Shareholders Equity. Shareholders equity increased 211,000, or 0.6 , to 36.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 36.5 million at June 30, 2024. Primarily a result of a net tax effect on unrealized gains on securities of 772,000, offset in part by a net loss of 633,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which includes certain one-time expenses noted in the noninterest expense section below, and partially offset by ESOP shares committed to be released. Average Balances and Yields . The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects are immaterial. Average balances are calculated using month-end average balances, rather than daily average balances. We believe the use of month-end average balances is representative of our operations. Non-accrual loans are included in average balances only. Average yields include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense. Deferred loan fees are immaterial.

For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Average Average Outstanding Yield/ Outstanding Yield/ Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Interest-earning assets: Loans 132,700 1,750 5.28 86,737 890 4.10 Investment securities 148,687 2,270 6.11 86,056 1,046 4.86 Interest-bearing deposits and other 9,467 123 5.20 14,328 145 4.05 Total interest-earning assets 290,854 4,143 5.70 187,121 2,081 4.45 Non-interest-earning assets 11,291 3,625 Allowance for loan losses (806) (351) Total assets 301,339 190,395 Interest-bearing liabilities: Interest-bearing demand 34,717 99 1.14 26,526 70 1.06 Savings and money market 48,800 286 2.34 40,072 77 0.77 Certificates of deposit 144,892 1,738 4.80 63,153 556 3.52 Total deposits 228,409 2,123 3.72 129,751 703 2.17 Borrowings 31,171 396 5.08 21,100 293 5.55 Total interest-bearing liabilities 259,580 2,519 3.88 150,851 996 2.64 Non-interest-bearing liabilities 4,313 1,532 Total liabilities 263,893 152,383 Equity 37,446 38,011 Total liabilities and equity 301,339 190,394 Net interest income 1,624 1,085 Net interest rate spread (1) 1.82 1.81 Net interest-earning assets (2) 31,274 36,270 Net interest margin (3) 2.23 2.32 Average interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities 112.05 124.04 

 (1) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate of interest-bearing liabilities. (2) Net interest-earning assets represent total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities. (3) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General. Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 633,000, an increase of 194,000, or 44.2 , compared to net loss of 439,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily due to a 842,000 increase in noninterest expense, which included certain one-time expenses as noted in the noninterest expense section below, that was partially offset by an increase in pre-provision net interest income of 539,000 as we continue to see incremental increases as a result of the addition of higher yielding investment securities and commercial loans. We continue to execute the strategic process of building out the balance sheet and adding organic interest earning assets funded with organic deposits. Interest Income. Interest income increased 2.0 million, or 99.1 , to 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.1 million for the three months ended September, 30, 2023. This increase was attributable to a 1.2 million, or 117.1 , increase in interest on investment securities and a 860,000, or 96.7 , increase in interest on loans, and is reflective of management s strategy to continue to add higher yielding interest earnings assets to the balance sheet. The average balance of loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 46.0 million, or 53.0 , from the average balance for the three months ended September 30, 2023, while the average yield on loans increased by 117 basis points to 5.27 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.10 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average yield reflects the increases in market interest rates impacting the loan portfolio, as well as the addition of several higher yielding loans as the Company continues to add commercial loans to the portfolio.

 The average balance of investment securities increased 62.6 million, or 72.8 , to 148.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 86.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, while the average yield on investment securities increased by 125 basis points to 6.11 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.86 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in yields resulted from the effects of management s purchasing of higher yielding securities beginning in March 2023. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits and other, comprised of overnight deposits and stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank, decreased 4.9 million, or -33.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the average yield increased 113 basis points to 5.18 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.05 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased 1.5 million, or 152.8 , to 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 996,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase of 155 basis points in the average cost of deposits to 3.72 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.17 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting how management has had to increase the offered rates to be competitive in efforts to maintain and grow deposits. The increase in interest expense also includes a 103,000 increase to 396,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to expense of 293,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, related to advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank under the Bank Term Funding Program. The advances have been part of a strategic initiative to fund higher yielding assets to help offset net interest margin compression experienced throughout the industry as a result of higher interest rates Net Interest Income . Net interest income increased 539,000, or 49.7 , to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, while net interest margin decreased 9 basis points to 2.23 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.32 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Provision for Credit Losses. The total provision for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments was 89,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 129,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In both periods, the provision for credit losses was largely attributable to commercial loan growth. Total nonperforming and substandard loans were 604,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to 414,000 at September 30, 2023. Total loans past due greater than 30 days were 2.9 million and 760,000 at those respective dates. As a percentage of nonperforming and substandard loans, the allowance for credit losses was 138.9 at September 30, 2024, compared to 160.0 at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses reflects the estimate management believes to be appropriate to cover lifetime probable losses which were inherent in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 and 2023. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, such estimates and assumptions could be proven incorrect in the future, and the actual amount of future provisions may exceed the amount of past provisions. Furthermore, as an integral part of its examination process, the OCC will periodically review our allowance for credit losses. The OCC may have judgments different than those of management, and we may determine to increase our allowance as a result of these regulatory reviews. Any material increase in the allowance for credit losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Non-Interest Income . Non-interest income remained flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024, at 50,000, compared to 45,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased 842,000, or 54.0 , to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to the increase in salaries and wages of 398,000, representative of our investing in staff as we continue to add key positions vital to the expansion and growth of the Company. Additionally, occupancy expenses have increased as a result of our Fort Wayne location which was not in place in September 2023. Other increases are seen in data processing fees as we continue to build out our suite of products with each product adding to ongoing recurring monthly expenses and increases of 59,000 in FDIC insurance premiums associated with our deposit growth. There were also 249,000 of one-time expenses incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024. See additional discussion of one-time expenses further below.

 One-time Expenses Related to Conversion At the time of the conversion on July 13, 2022, the Bank estimated that it would incur a one-time expense in the third quarter 2022 related to the termination of the defined benefit plan of approximately 3.1 million. Given the increase in interest rates since the time of the initial estimation, the actual cost of termination of the defined benefit plan is expected to be approximately 1.35 million, with over 1 million of those expenses occurring in fiscal year 2023 In January 2023, the board of directors agreed to take the necessary steps to become a regional commercial bank, ultimately electing to become a Covered Savings Association (CSA) instead of remaining as a Qualified Thrift Lender (QTL). The board of directors, in conjunction with the decreased one-time expenses related to the termination of the defined benefit plan, approved 1.85 million of one-time expenses for, among other things, investments in products, services, software, operating system modules, branding, personnel, consulting fees and training related to obtaining the capabilities required of a regional commercial bank. The following is management s classification of these expenses for fiscal year 2023, 2024, and year to date fiscal year 2025: 

Year Ended June 30, Quarter Ended Total since 2023 2024 September 30, 2024 Conversion Category Termination of defined benefit plan 1,052,000 261,000 1,313,000 Contract termination and related personnel costs 256,000 206,000 2,000 464,000 IT and software maintenance and related consulting fees 102,000 154,000 8,000 264,000 Branding related costs 5,000 385,000 129,000 519,000 Other costs 105,000 110,000 215,000 Total one-time expenses 1,415,000 1,111,000 249,000 2,775,000 Federal Income Taxes. Provision for federal income taxes benefit increased 52,000, or 41.7 , to a 175,000 benefit provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 124,000 benefit provision for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the federal income tax benefit provision was due primarily to a 245,000, or 43.6 , increase in pretax net loss. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland under the Bank Term Funding Program. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of 21.7 million from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and 11.0 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. At September 30, 2024, we had the capacity to borrow 33.9 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities. For further information, see the statements of cash flows contained in the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. Prior to September 30, 2024, the Bank had a community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) framework election in effect. Effective for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Bank opted out of that election.

 At September 30, 2024, the Bank was categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since the most recent notification that management believes have changed the Bank s prompt corrective action category. The following table presents actual and required capital ratios for the Bank.

At September 30, 2024, we had 34.9 million of outstanding commitments to originate loans. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2024 totaled 44.5 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not applicable, as the Company is a smaller reporting company. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, such as this report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of September 30, 2024. Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting The Company s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company s financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the assessment using those criteria, management identified material weaknesses related to the Company s internal control over financial reporting and, as such, concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of September 30, 2024. A 

 31 

Table of Contents 
 material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses were identified in the Company s internal control over financial reporting: The Company has not identified, designed and maintained all applicable internal controls which has led to a level of precision on account reconciliations and review of financial statements that is less than what is required of an SEC filer. The material weakness did not result in a material misstatement. 
 The Company has concluded that the existence of these material weaknesses did not result in a material misstatement of the Company s financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, or in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and year ended June 30, 2024, the Company made notable improvements in its internal controls over financial reporting. In addition to adding a new Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Controller in calendar year 2023, the Company also added two additional accounting staff early in calendar 2024, allowing for additional segregation of duties and more levels of review. Management has also engaged, and is currently working with a third party on a SOX gap analysis, internal control risk assessment, and regularly occurring internal audits. This work began in September 2024 and is ongoing. The Company expects this work to allow the Company to develop and implement enhanced internal controls over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the resolution of these legal actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors Not applicable, as the Company is a smaller reporting company. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Not applicable. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities Not applicable. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information During the three month period ending September 30, 2024, of the Company s directors or executive officers , modified or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a trading as terms are defined under Item 408 of Regulation S-K.
