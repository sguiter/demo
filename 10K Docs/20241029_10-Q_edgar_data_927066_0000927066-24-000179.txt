 and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The delay in recognition of these amounts resulted predominantly from measurement limitations and recognition constraints on the Company's VBC contracts with health plans, many of which are complex and relatively new arrangements. Recognition of revenue from the Company's government Comprehensive Kidney Care Contracting (CKCC) program also have certain constraints for plan years 2023 and 2024. 
 Measurements of revenue for the Company's IKC risk-based arrangements are complex, sensitive to a number of key inputs, and require meaningful estimates for a number of factors, including but not limited to member alignment data, third-party medical claims expense, outcomes on various quality metrics, and ultimate risk adjustment factor (RAF) scores. Information and other measurement limitations on these factors may constrain revenue recognition for a risk-based arrangement until a period after the Company's performance obligations have been met.

 if certain performance targets or quality margins are met over the next one year to . The estimated fair value measurements of these contingent earn-out obligations are primarily based on unobservable inputs, including key financial metrics such as projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), revenue and other key performance indicators. The estimated fair values of these contingent earn-out obligations are remeasured as of each reporting date and could fluctuate based upon any significant changes in key assumptions, such as changes in the Company's credit risk adjusted rate that is used to discount obligations to present value. 
 The estimated fair value of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions is based principally on the higher of either estimated liquidation value of net assets or a multiple of earnings for each subject dialysis partnership, based on historical earnings, revenue mix, and other performance indicators that can affect future results. The multiples used for these valuations are derived from observed ownership transactions for dialysis businesses between unrelated parties in the U.S. in recent years, and the specific valuation multiple applied to each dialysis partnership is principally determined by its recent and expected revenue mix and contribution margin. As of September 30, 2024, an increase or decrease in the weighted average multiple used in these valuations of one times EBITDA would change the estimated fair value of these noncontrolling interests by approximately .

 The following should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 25 

Company Overview 
 Our principal business is to provide dialysis and related lab services to patients in the United States, which we refer to as our U.S. dialysis business. We also operate our U.S. integrated kidney care (IKC) business, our U.S. other ancillary services, and our international operations, which we collectively refer to as our ancillary services, as well as our corporate administrative support functions. Our U.S. dialysis business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the U.S. for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end stage renal disease (ESRD) or end stage kidney disease (ESKD). 
 General Economic and Marketplace Conditions; Legal and Regulatory Developments 
 Developments in general economic and market conditions have directly and indirectly impacted the Company and in the future could have a material adverse impact on our patients, teammates, physician partners, suppliers, business, operations, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, share price, cash flows and/or liquidity. Many of these external factors and conditions are interrelated, including, among other things, inflation, potential interest rate volatility and other economic conditions, labor market conditions, wage pressure, the increased mortality rates of our patients and other ESKD or CKD patients, supply chain challenges and the potential impact and application of innovative technologies, drugs or other treatments. Certain of these impacts could be further intensified by concurrent global events such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in Israel, Gaza and the surrounding areas, which have continued to drive sociopolitical and economic uncertainty across the globe, as well as severe weather events and other natural disasters, such as Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, which have impacted national supply chain challenges, among other things. 
 Operational and Financial Impacts 
 In the third quarter of 2024, treatment per day volumes were generally flat compared to the second quarter of 2024. We continue to experience a negative impact on revenue and treatment volume due to, among other things, elevated mortality rates of our patients in comparison to the periods prior to the pandemic and the associated adverse impact on our patient census. Treatment volumes during the year have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by higher than expected missed treatment rates, which during the quarter were driven primarily by severe weather events. In addition, new-to-dialysis admission rates, treatment volumes, future revenues and non-acquired growth, among other things, could continue to be negatively impacted over time to the extent that the ESKD and CKD populations experience sustained elevated mortality levels. The magnitude of these cumulative impacts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Ongoing global economic conditions and political and regulatory developments, such as general labor, supply chain and inflationary pressures have increased, and will likely continue to increase, our expenses, including, among others, staffing, labor, and supply costs. We have significant suppliers and service providers, with a substantial portion of our total vendor spend concentrated with a limited number of third party suppliers and service providers. These third party suppliers and service providers include, without limitation, providers performing certain key functions for us such as claims processing functions, suppliers of pharmaceuticals or clinical products that may be the primary source of products critical to the services we provide, or to which we have committed obligations to make purchases, sometimes at particular prices. It may be difficult, costly and time consuming for us to transition away from any of these significant suppliers and service providers. We have experienced service disruptions relating to key business functions and supply chain shortages with respect to certain of our equipment and clinical supplies, including critical clinical and other supplies. While we have made certain operational changes in response to the foregoing, there can be no assurance that a future shortage or disruption would not require additional resources or further operational changes in the future. 
 There can be no assurance that our third party suppliers and service providers will provide, or continue to provide, the services or products that we require or that substitute services or products, or alternate suppliers or service providers, can be identified or transitioned to on a timely or cost-effective basis or at all. If our significant suppliers and service providers do not meet our needs, and we are not able to find adequate alternative sources for these products or services on a timely or cost-effective basis, it could require us to make significant operational changes, could impact our ability to provide dialysis services we offer, and could otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 In September 2024, Baxter International Inc. (Baxter) notified us that Hurricane Helene caused extensive damage to its manufacturing plant in North Cove, North Carolina. The damage required Baxter to close the facility and halt production of certain clinical products Baxter supplies to us and other health care providers, including saline and peritoneal dialysate. As a result of this disruption, we worked with Baxter, other suppliers, and federal and state governmental agencies to identify alternate sources for these supplies and have implemented certain operational measures, including conservation measures and a temporary hold on new starts for PD home-based dialysis, all of which were developed to maintain continuity of care for our 
 26 

patients. Most of these operational changes remain ongoing, and we are continuing to assess the potential impact of this storm and other severe weather events on our business and results of operations. In general, we are continuing to assess the balance of efficiency and resilience in evaluating the risk of future supply chain shortages or service disruptions. For further discussion of the risks related to our supplier needs, see the discussion in the risk factors in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 10-K under the heading, " If certain of our suppliers do not meet our needs... " 
 During the quarter we continued to pay elevated compensation levels to our teammates compared to the prior year. We expect certain of these increased staffing and labor costs to continue, due to, among other factors, the continuation of a challenging healthcare labor market. The cumulative impact of these increased costs could be material. In addition, potential staffing shortages or other potential developments or disruptions related to our teammates, if material, could ultimately lead to the unplanned closures of certain centers or adversely impact clinical operations, or may otherwise have a material adverse impact on our ability to provide dialysis services or the cost of providing those services, among other things. Our industry has also experienced increased union organizing activities. For example, union petitions have been filed in nine of our clinics in California and eight of these petitions are in different stages of the voting process and have been subject to legal challenges. We also have experienced a week-long attempted union-related work stoppage in these eight clinics, which concluded without impacting our ability to provide patient care. Regardless of the outcome of the ongoing elections, other teammates at other clinics may file similar petitions in the future, and these petitions, if filed, may lead to additional elections. If a significant portion of our teammates were to become unionized, we could experience, among other things, potential additional work stoppages or other business disruptions; adverse impacts to our financial results due to the costs of bargaining or implementing a grievance procedure and processing grievances; decreases in our operational flexibility and efficiency; or negative impacts on our employee culture. In addition, we are and may continue to be subject to targeted corporate campaigns by union organizers in response to which we have been and expect to continue to be required to expend substantial resources, both time and financial. Any of these events or circumstances, including our responses to such events or circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on our employee relations, treatment growth, productivity, business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. For further discussion of the risks related to rising labor costs and union organizing activities, see the discussion in the risk factors in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 10-K under the heading, " Our business is labor intensive... " 
 The impact of the pandemic on our patient population combined with the cost inflation trends and the inability of government reimbursement rates to keep pace with these cost trends, have put pressure on our existing cost structure, and we expect that certain of those increased costs will persist as inflationary and supply chain pressures and challenging labor market conditions continue, each as noted above. During the third quarter of 2024, we continued to invest in and implement cost savings initiatives designed to help mitigate these cost and volume pressures. These include identified cost savings related to the achievement of general and administrative cost efficiencies through ongoing initiatives, including, among others, those that increase our use of third party service providers to perform certain activities. These opportunities and investments also include, among others, initiatives relating to clinic optimization, capacity utilization improvement and procurement opportunities, as well as investments in revenue cycle management. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, charges in connection with the continued implementation of certain of these initiatives. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute these initiatives or that they will achieve expectations or succeed in helping offset the impact of these challenging conditions. 
 Legal and Regulatory Developments 
 As previously reported, on May 7, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published in the federal register a final rule that would generally ban all post-employment non-compete clauses with employees and prohibit employers from enforcing existing non-compete clauses in contracts with workers, with limited exceptions. On August 20, 2024, a federal court issued an injunction against the rule, preventing the FTC from enforcing it nationwide. As result, the FTC cannot implement or enforce its rule against any employer without violating the nationwide ban. The FTC is considering whether to appeal. Even though the rule has been enjoined, many state legislatures continue to introduce legislation that seeks to place limitations on restrictive covenants with workers. While few of these states have passed legislation that has directly affected our business, it is possible that new legislation could be introduced in the future. We are continuing to assess the potential impact of the rule as well as Congressional and state legislative efforts on our business. Such efforts, if successful, could have an adverse impact on, among other things, our agreements with teammates, our arrangements with medical directors, or the terms of our existing agreements with physicians. Any failure on our part to adequately adjust to any state regulations or future federal or state regulations and the potential impact thereof could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. 
 27 

Change Healthcare 
 As previously reported, due to a cybersecurity breach that affected Change Healthcare (CHC), a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group (United) that serves as an intermediary for processing the vast majority of our payment claims for domestic commercial and government payors, we temporarily suspended all claims processing activity with CHC (CHC Outage), primarily during a period of time during the first and second quarters, which impacted our cash flows. We have since resumed claims submissions and billing processes through CHC s information technology systems and as of the date of this filing, through a combination of CHC's platform and certain alternate billing processes, we are current on our primary claims submissions. However, the CHC Outage, and the resultant delay in claims submissions, led to an increase in our days sales outstanding, among other things, which increase has since subsided, but we do continue to see delays in, and issues with, collections with some payors. 
 CHC has publicly reported online and in notices to affected individuals that it identified protected health information (PHI), or personally identifiable information (PII), from users of the CHC systems, and while CHC has been conducting investigations and data forensics, to date, we have not been informed that any of our data, including any PHI or PII from our patients, was impacted by the CHC Outage. However, the ultimate impact of the CHC Outage remains subject to future developments and risks that are difficult to predict. These risks may include, among other things, a recurrence of system outages or service suspensions or the risk that our information technology systems or our proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including PHI or PII, may have been compromised through the CHC Outage, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. For a discussion of the risks associated with outages, disruptions or incidents at third parties on which we rely, see the risk factors in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 10-K under the headings, " Failing to effectively maintain, operate or upgrade our information systems or those of third-party service providers upon which we rely... " and " Privacy and information security laws are complex " 
 We believe that the aforementioned recent developments and general economic and marketplace conditions will continue to impact the Company in the future. Their ultimate impact depends on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.

 Our U.S. dialysis treatment volume is directly correlated with our operating revenues and expenses. The increase in our U.S. dialysis treatments for the third quarter of 2024 from the second quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by one additional treatment day, partially offset by an increase in missed treatments and decreased patient count. The increase in our U.S. dialysis treatments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by one additional treatment day and increased treatments from acquired and non-acquired treatment growth.

 Certain columns, rows or percentages may not sum due to the presentation of rounded numbers. 
 U.S. dialysis average patient service revenue per treatment for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 increased primarily due to increases in average reimbursement rates and other normal fluctuations. 
 30 

U.S. dialysis average patient service revenue per treatment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by the increase in average reimbursement rates from normal annual rate increases including Medicare rate increases, as well as revenue cycle improvements, favorable changes in mix and an increase in hospital inpatient dialysis rates. 
 In June 2024, Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a proposed rule to update the Medicare ESRD Prospective Payment System payment rate and policies for calendar year 2025. Among other things, the proposed rule, if finalized, would allow Medicare payment for dialysis in the home setting for beneficiaries with acute kidney injury and update requirements for the ESRD Quality Incentive Program. CMS estimates that the overall impact of the proposed rule will increase ESRD freestanding facilities average reimbursement by 2.1 in 2025.

 Charges impacting operating income 
 Closure costs. In the third quarter of 2022, we began a strategic review of our outpatient clinic capacity requirements and utilization, which had been significantly impacted by declines in our patient census due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This review continued through 2023, and has resulted in higher than normal charges for center capacity closures over the last several quarters. These capacity closure costs include net losses on assets retired, lease termination costs, asset impairments and accelerated depreciation and amortization. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we incurred charges for U.S. dialysis center closures of approximately 18.3 million, which increased our patient care costs by 3.5 million, our general and administrative expenses by 3.8 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by 11.0 million. By comparison, during the second quarter of 2024, charges for U.S. dialysis center closures were approximately 15.3 million, which increased our patient care costs by 6.5 million, our general and administrative expenses by 8.7 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by 0.1 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, charges for U.S. dialysis center closures were approximately 48.2 million, which increased our patient care costs by 13.3 million, our general and administrative expenses by 19.6 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by 15.3 million. By comparison, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, charges for U.S. dialysis center closures were approximately 67.3 million, which increased our patient care costs by 
 31 

22.7 million, our general and administrative expenses by 16.0 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by 28.6 million. 
 We will continue to optimize our U.S. dialysis center footprint through center mergers and/or closures and expect our center closure rates to remain at elevated levels over the remainder of 2024. 
 Severance costs. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we committed to a plan to increase efficiencies and cost savings in certain general and administrative support functions. As a result of this plan, we recognized expenses related to termination and other benefit commitments in our U.S. dialysis business. This plan included charges of 26.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Patient care costs. U.S. dialysis patient care costs per treatment for the third quarter of 2024 increased from the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to increased compensation expenses, including increased wage rates and payroll taxes. Patient care costs per treatment were also affected by increases in health benefit expense and other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, including seasonal increases in utilities expense, as well as increased minor equipment expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases in insurance costs and travel costs. Additionally, our fixed other direct operating expenses positively impacted patient care costs per treatment due to increased treatments in the third quarter of 2024. Patient care costs per treatment were also favorably impacted by decreased medical supplies expense, professional fees and center closure costs. 
 U.S. dialysis patient care costs per treatment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increased compensation expenses, including increased wage rates and headcount, as well as increases in health benefit expense, medical supplies expense, insurance costs and other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, including lower expense in the nine months ended 2023 related to our virtual power purchase arrangements. These increases were partially offset by decreased contributions to charitable organizations, contract wages, center closure costs, IT-related costs and professional fees. 
 General and administrative expenses. U.S. dialysis general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2024 increased from the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to increased advocacy costs, compensation expenses, IT-related costs, travel costs and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in center closure costs. 
 U.S. dialysis general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to increased compensation expenses, including increased wage rate and headcount, as well as increases in advocacy costs, including a refund received in 2023 related to 2022 advocacy costs. Other drivers of this change include increases in IT-related costs, contract wages, center closure costs and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by decreased severance costs, as described above, and contributions to charitable organizations. 
 Depreciation and amortization. U.S. dialysis depreciation and amortization expenses in the third quarter of 2024 increased compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to increased accelerated depreciation related to center closures. 
 U.S. dialysis depreciation and amortization expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased primarily due to decreased accelerated depreciation related to center closures. 
 Equity investment income. U.S. dialysis equity investment income for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 increased due to increased profitability at certain nonconsolidated dialysis partnerships. Equity investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the consolidation of a previously nonconsolidated dialysis partnership in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by increased profitability at certain nonconsolidated dialysis partnerships. 
 Gain on changes in ownership interests. During the first quarter of 2024, we acquired a controlling interest in a previously nonconsolidated dialysis partnership for which we recognized a non-cash gain of 35.1 million on our prior investment upon consolidation.

 U.S. dialysis operating income for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 was negatively impacted by increased compensation expenses, health benefit expense and other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, including seasonal increases in utilities expense. Operating income was also negatively impacted by increased advocacy costs, center closure costs, as described above, IT-related costs and minor equipment expense. Operating income was positively impacted by increased average patient service revenue per treatment and dialysis treatments, as described above, as well as decreased insurance costs. 
 U.S. dialysis operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by a gain on changes in ownership interest and severance costs, as described above. U.S. dialysis operating income and adjusted operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were positively impacted by an increase in average patient service revenue per treatment and dialysis treatments, as described above. Operating income and adjusted operating income were also positively impacted by decreases in contributions to charitable organizations, center closure costs, as described above, and contract wages. Operating income and adjusted operating income were negatively impacted by increases in compensation expenses, health benefit expense, medical supplies expense and advocacy costs, including the refund described above. Operating income and adjusted operating income were also negatively impacted by increases in insurance costs, IT-related costs and other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers. 
 
 Other Ancillary services 
 Our other operations include ancillary services that are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. As of September 30, 2024, these consisted principally of our U.S. IKC business, certain U.S. other ancillary businesses (including our clinical research programs, transplant software business, and venture investment group), and our international operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, DaVita IKC provided integrated care and disease management services to approximately 69,500 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements and to an additional 13,900 patients in other integrated care arrangements. We also expect to add additional service offerings to our business and pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future as circumstances warrant, which could include, among other things, healthcare services not related to kidney disease. 
 For a discussion of the risks related to IKC and our ancillary services, see the discussion in the risk factors in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 10-K under the headings, " The U.S. integrated kidney care, U.S. other ancillary services and international operations that we operate or invest in now or in the future..." and "If we are not able to successfully implement our strategy with respect to our integrated kidney care and value-based care initiatives..." 
 As of September 30, 2024, our international dialysis operations provided dialysis and administrative services through a total of 453 outpatient dialysis centers located in 13 countries outside of the United States.

Revenues 
 IKC revenues for the third quarter of 2024 decreased compared to the second quarter of 2024 due to a decrease in revenues related to the disposal of our physician services business, partially offset by an increase in revenues from our special needs plans and a net increase in shared savings. U.S. other ancillary revenues for the third quarter of 2024 remained relatively flat compared to the second quarter of 2024. International revenues for the third quarter of 2024 increased compared to the second quarter of 2024 due to acquired treatment growth.

U.S. other ancillary services revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained relatively flat compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our international revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to acquired and non-acquired treatment growth and average reimbursement rate increases in certain countries. 
 Charges impacting operating income 
 Severance and other costs . During the fourth quarter of 2022, similar to U.S. dialysis, we committed to a plan to increase efficiencies and cost savings in certain general and administrative support functions and other overhead costs. As a result of this plan, we recognized expenses related to termination and other benefit commitments in our IKC business of 0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) 
 IKC operating loss for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 decreased, primarily due to decreased medical costs and increased revenues related to our special needs plans, as well as the disposal of our physician services business. U.S. other ancillary services operating loss for the third quarter of 2024 was relatively flat compared to the second quarter of 2024. International operating income for the third quarter of 2024 increased from the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to increased revenues, as described above, partially offset by acquisition-related operating costs and decreased equity income resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency at our APAC JV. 
 IKC operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by severance costs, as described above. IKC operating loss and adjusted operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased, primarily due to a net increase in shared savings, the disposal of our physician services business and decreased medical costs for our special needs plans. These increases were partially offset by continued investments in our integrated care support functions and decreased revenues from our special needs plans. Other U.S. ancillary services operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained relatively flat compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. International operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by increased acquisition-related costs, partially offset by increases in revenue, as described above.

Accruals for legal matters. During nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a charge of 11 million for a legal matter within corporate administrative support. 
 Corporate administrative support expenses for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 increased primarily due to increased payroll taxes and professional fees. Corporate administrative support expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were affected by accruals for legal matters, as described above. Corporate administrative support expenses and adjusted corporate administrative support expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased primarily due to decreased long-term incentive compensation, partially offset by increased compensation expenses.

 Debt expense 
 Debt expense for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 increased primarily due to an increase in our weighted average effective interest rate principally related to the expiration of our 2019 interest rate cap agreements on June 30, 2024, which had lower rates than our currently effective interest rate caps. This change was also driven by an increase in our long-term debt balance related to the incremental borrowing on our Term Loan A-1 and issuance of 6.875 senior notes due 2032, partially offset by the repayment of our Term Loan B-1. 
 Debt expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased primarily due to an increase in our long-term debt balance related to the issuance of 6.875 senior notes due 2032 and incremental borrowing on our Term Loan A-1, partially offset by the repayment of the non-extended Term Loan B-1, as well as an increase in our weighted average effective interest rate principally related to the expiration of our 2019 interest rate cap agreements, as described above. 
 Our overall weighted average effective interest rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.69 compared to 4.27 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on the components of our debt. 
 36 

Debt prepayment, extinguishment and modification costs 
 The three months ended September 30, 2024 included debt prepayment, extinguishment and modifications costs of 10 million comprised partially of fees incurred in connection with the additional incremental borrowing on our Term Loan A-1 (the Incremental Term Loan A-1) and partially of deferred financing costs and original issue discount written off for the extinguishment of the non-extended Term Loan B-1. Comparatively, the three months ended June 30, 2024 included debt prepayment, extinguishment and modification costs of 10 million comprised partially of fees incurred in connection with the extension of the maturity date of a portion of our Term Loan B-1 from August 2026 to May 2031 (the Term Loan B-1 Extension) and partially of deferred financing costs and original issue discount written off for the portion of debt considered extinguished and reborrowed as a result of the Term Loan B-1 Extension. 
 The nine months ended September 30, 2024 included debt prepayment, extinguishment and modification costs of 20 million comprised partially of fees incurred in connection with the Incremental Term Loan A-1 and Term Loan B-1 Extension, each described above, and partially of deferred financing costs and original issue discount written off for the extinguishment of the non-extended Term Loan B-1 as described above. Comparatively, the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included debt extinguishment and modification costs of 8 million related to the refinancing of our prior Term Loan A and prior revolving line of credit. These costs were composed partially of deferred financing costs written off for the portion of this debt considered extinguished and reborrowed and partially of fees incurred as part of this debt refinancing. See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on the Incremental Term Loan A-1, Term Loan B-1 Extension and the components of our debt. 
 Other loss, net 
 Other loss for the third quarter of 2024 decreased compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to a decrease in equity investment losses at Mozarc Medical Holding LLC (Mozarc), increased interest income and decreased losses on foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased net losses on other investments. Other loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increased equity investment losses in Mozarc, including the 14 million gain recognized in the second quarter of 2023 on the non-cash assets contributed to Mozarc, partially offset by decreases in net losses on other investments and losses on foreign currency translation. 
 Effective income tax rate 
 The effective income tax rate and the effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. increased for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to an increase in nondeductible executive compensation. 
 The effective income tax rate and the effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to one time benefits recognized in the connection with the closure of our federal IRS exam during 2023 and a larger benefit recognized for finalized tax returns in 2023 partially offset by a nontaxable noncash gain on change in ownership recognized in 2024. 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
 The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the third quarter of 2024 from the second quarter of 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to increased profitability at certain U.S. dialysis partnerships. 
 
 U.S. dialysis accounts receivable 
 Our U.S. dialysis accounts receivable balances at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 1.707 billion and 1.632 billion, respectively, representing approximately 54 days of revenue outstanding (DSO) for both periods. Our DSO calculation is based on the current quarter s average revenues per day. There were no significant changes from the second quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2024 in the carrying amount of accounts receivable outstanding over one year old.

 (1) Maintenance capital expenditures represent capital expenditures to maintain the productive capacity of the business and include those made for investments in information technology, dialysis center renovations, capital asset replacements, and any other capital expenditures that are not development or acquisition expenditures. 
 (2) Development capital expenditures principally represent capital expenditures (other than acquisition expenditures) made to expand the productive capacity of the business and include those for new U.S. and international dialysis center developments, dialysis center expansions and relocations, and new or expanded contracted hospital operations. 
 (3) For a reconciliation of our free cash flow, see the " Reconciliations of Non-GAAP measures " section below. 
 Consolidated cash flows 
 Consolidated cash flows from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was principally due to decreased cash collections resulting from the CHC Outage, described above, and increased cash taxes paid, partially offset by improved operating results and increases in other working capital items. 
 CHC began to restore claims submission functionality on March 28, 2024 and we have resumed claims submissions and billing processes through CHC s information technology systems. As of September 30, 2024, through a combination of CHC's platform and certain alternate billing processes, we are current on our primary claims submissions. During the third quarter of 
 38 

2024, accounts receivable balances and DSO have declined, but we do continue to see delays in, and issues with, collections with some payors. 
 Free cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, as described above, and increased distributions to noncontrolling interests partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures. 
 Significant sources of cash during the period included the extension of the maturity date from August 2026 to May 2031 for a portion of our Term Loan B-1 (the Extended Term Loan B-1 transaction) in the aggregate principal amount of approximately 1,640 million, (such portion referred to as the Extended Term Loan B-1), the incurrence of an incremental Term Loan A-1 tranche in the aggregate principal amount of 1,100 million (such portion referred to as the Incremental Term Loan A-1), the issuance of 6.875 senior notes due 2032 in the amount of 1,000 million (the 6.875 Senior Notes) and Change Healthcare temporary funding assistance of 120 million, net, pursuant to the CHC Funding Arrangement in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Significant uses of cash during that same period included debt prepayments on Term Loan B-1 in the aggregate amount of approximately 2,590 million as part of the Extended Term Loan B-1, Incremental Term Loan A-1 and 6.875 Senior Notes transactions, and regularly scheduled principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling approximately 45 million on our Term Loan A-1 and 14 million on Term Loan B-1, as well as additional required payments under other debt arrangements. Additionally, we recognized financing cash outflows of 35 million in deferred financing costs and discount related to the Fourth and Sixth Amendments to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and 6.875 Senior Notes transactions, as well as 11 million in cap premium fees for our 2024 forward interest rate cap agreements. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we used cash to repurchase 7,507,842 shares of our common stock. 
 By comparison, the same period in 2023 included the pay-off of the remaining principal balance outstanding on our prior Term Loan A and prior revolving line of credit in the amount of 1,444 million and 150 million, respectively, and regularly scheduled and other principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling approximately 54 million on our prior Term Loan A, 8 million on our new Term Loan A-1, 50 million on Term Loan B-1, additional net repayments of 15 million on our revolving line of credit, as well as additional required payments under other debt arrangements. Additionally, we recognized financing cash outflows of 30 million in deferred financing costs related to the Second and Third Amendments to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and 23 million in cap premium fees for our 2023 forward interest cap agreements. Significant sources of cash during the period included the refinancing of our prior Term Loan A and revolving line of credit with a secured Term Loan A-1 facility in the aggregate principal amount of 1,250 million. 
 Dialysis center footprint 
 The table below shows the footprint of our dialysis operations by number of dialysis centers owned or operated:

Stock repurchases 
 The following table summarizes our common stock repurchases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Shares repurchased (in thousands) Amount paid (in millions) (1) 
 Average price paid per share (2) 
 Shares repurchased (in thousands) Amount paid (in millions) (1) 
 Average price paid per share (2) 
 Open market repurchases: 2,734 406 147.20 7,508 1,022 134.98 
 
 (1) Includes commissions and the 1 excise tax imposed on certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The excise tax is recorded as part of the cost basis of treasury stock repurchased and, as such, is included in stockholders equity. 
 (2) Excludes commissions and the excise tax described above. 
 We did not repurchase any shares during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Available liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an undrawn revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facilities of 1.5 billion. Credit available under this revolving line of credit is reduced by the amount of any letters of credit outstanding thereunder, of which there were none as of September 30, 2024. We separately had approximately 154 million in letters of credit outstanding under a separate bilateral secured letter of credit facility. 
 See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for components of our long-term debt and their interest rates. 
 We believe that our cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including from amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our access to the capital markets, will be sufficient to fund our scheduled debt service under the terms of our debt agreements and other obligations for the foreseeable future, including the next 12 months. From time to time, depending on market conditions, our capital requirements and the availability of financing, among other things, we may seek to refinance our existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness. Our primary recurrent sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings, which are subject to general, economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, as described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 10-K . 
 
 Reconciliations of Non-GAAP measures 
 The following tables provide reconciliations of adjusted operating income (loss) to operating income (loss) as presented on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis for our U.S. dialysis reportable segment as well as for our U.S. IKC business, our U.S. other ancillary services, our international business, and for our total ancillary services which combines them and is disclosed as our other segments category, in addition to our corporate administrative support. 
 In connection with a comment letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff, beginning in the second quarter of 2024, we have updated the presentation of our non-GAAP measures to no longer exclude center closure costs for all periods presented. To facilitate comparisons, the non-GAAP measures presented for prior periods also have been conformed to the presentation of the non-GAAP measures for the current period. 
 These non-GAAP or "adjusted" measures are presented because management believes these measures are useful adjuncts to, but not alternatives for, our GAAP results. Specifically, management uses adjusted operating income (loss) to compare and evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe this non-GAAP measure is also useful to investors and analysts in evaluating our performance over time and relative to competitors, as well as in analyzing the underlying trends in our business. We also believe this presentation enhances a user's understanding of our normal operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. 
 In addition, our effective income tax rate on income attributable to DaVita Inc. excludes noncontrolling owners' income, which primarily relates to non-tax paying entities. We believe this adjusted effective income tax rate is useful to management, investors and analysts in evaluating our performance and establishing expectations for income taxes incurred on our ordinary results attributable to DaVita Inc. 
 40 

Finally, our free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less distributions to noncontrolling interests, development capital expenditures, and maintenance capital expenditures; plus contributions from noncontrolling interests and proceeds from the sale of self-developed properties. Management uses this measure to assess our ability to fund acquisitions and meet our debt service obligations and we believe this measure is equally useful to investors and analysts as an adjunct to cash flows from operating activities and other measures under GAAP. 
 It is important to bear in mind that these non-GAAP "adjusted" measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, nor as substitutes for, their most comparable GAAP measures.

 Certain columns or rows in the above tables may not sum or recalculate due to the presentation of rounded numbers. 
 
 (1) Represents a non-cash gain recognized on the acquisition of a controlling financial interest in a previously nonconsolidated dialysis partnership. See additional discussion above under the heading " Gain on changes in ownership interests " within " U.S. dialysis results of operations ". This gain to mark the investment to fair value prior to consolidation does not represent a normal and recurring cost of operating our business or generating revenues and may obscure analysis of underlying trends and financial performance. 
 (2) Includes severance and other termination costs related to a prior strategic restructuring initiative and associated transition of certain general and administrative support functions to a third party. See additional discussion above under the heading " Severance costs " within " U.S. dialysis results of operations " and " Severance and other costs " within " Ancillary services results of operations ". 
 (3) Represents an accrual for potential third-party settlement costs for the matter further described in Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements under the heading " 2017 U.S. Attorney Colorado Investigation ". We have excluded this charge, which had been previously disclosed, from our non-GAAP metrics because, among other things, we do not believe it is indicative of our ordinary results of operations. In this instance, among the factors considered were that the claim relates to prior ancillary operations or activities that we sold or closed (or otherwise ceased) prior to June 2020, and the charge is significant and may obscure analysis of underlying trends and financial performance of our current business.

(4) In connection with the conclusion of a comment letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff in July 2024, beginning in the second quarter 2024, we have updated the presentation of our non-GAAP measures to no longer exclude center closure costs for all periods presented. To facilitate comparisons, the non-GAAP measures presented for prior periods also have been conformed to the presentation of the non-GAAP measures for the current period.

 Off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 
 In addition to the debt obligations and operating lease liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with letters of credit, as well as certain working capital funding obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated dialysis ventures that we manage and some that we manage which are wholly-owned by third parties. For additional information see Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 We also have potential obligations to purchase the noncontrolling interests held by third parties in many of our majority-owned dialysis partnerships and other nonconsolidated entities. These obligations are in the form of put provisions that are exercisable at the third-party owners discretion within specified periods as outlined in each specific put provision. For additional information on these obligations and how we measure and report them, see Note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report and Notes 16 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 10-K. 
 For information on the maturities and other terms of our long-term debt, see Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately 154 million under a bilateral secured letter of credit facility separate from our senior secured credit facilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have outstanding purchase agreements with various suppliers to purchase set amounts of dialysis equipment, parts, pharmaceuticals and supplies. If we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitments under these contracts during any year, we are required to pay the difference to the supplier, as described further in Note 16 to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 10-K. 
 42 

On March 5, 2024, we entered into four separate purchase agreements with Fresenius Medical Care to acquire their dialysis service operations in Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil. Chile and Ecuador closed during the first six months of 2024. Colombia and Brazil are expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, respectively, and remain subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval as of September 30, 2024. Expected cash payments for these remaining transactions are approximately 180 million, subject to certain customary adjustments.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Interest rate and foreign currency sensitivity 
 There has been no material change in the nature of the Company's interest rate risks or foreign currency exchange risks from those described in Part II Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of September 30, 2024. For further information on the components of the Company's long-term debt and their interest rates, see Note 7 to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q at Part I Item 1.

 (1) Represents the fair value of the Company s long-term debt excluding financing leases. See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 The scheduled principal payments for all debt that bears a variable rate by its terms, including all of Extended Term Loan B-1 and Term Loan A-1, have been included on the variable rate line of the schedule of expected maturities above and have been included in the calculation of the average variable interest rate presented. Additionally, the Change Healthcare temporary funding assistance, which is interest-free, has been included in the fixed rate line of the schedule of expected maturities and the calculation of the average fixed interest rate presented above. 
 However, principal amounts of 1,640 million for Extended Term Loan B-1 and 1,860 million of Term Loan A-1 (the capped debt) were effectively hedged by our 2019 interest rate cap agreements through June 30, 2024, with additional caps from our 2023 and 2024 interest rate cap agreements extending for further periods. As of September 30, 2024, applicable SOFR rates were above the interest rate thresholds of our cap agreements making the interest rates on this capped debt "economically fixed." As a result, as of September 30, 2024, total fixed and economically fixed debt was 9,173 million, with an average interest rate of 5.63 , while total variable rate debt not subject to caps was 451 million with an average rate of 6.91 . 
 See Note 7 for further details on the Company s interest rate cap agreements. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) as amended is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 At the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with the Exchange Act requirements as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as required by the Exchange Act as of such date for our Exchange Act reports, including this report. Management recognizes that these controls and procedures can 
 43 

provide only reasonable assurance of desired outcomes, and that estimates and judgments are still inherent in the process of maintaining effective controls and procedures. 
 There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that was identified during the evaluation that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
