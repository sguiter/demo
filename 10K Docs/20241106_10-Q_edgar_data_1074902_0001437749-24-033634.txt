 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 

LCNB adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under ASC 326, while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable guidance. The following table shows the impact of adopting ASC 326 on January 1, 2023 in thousands): 

ACL on loans 
 ACL on debt securities, held to maturity 
 Deferred tax assets, net 
 
 Liabilities: 
 ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures 
 
 Shareholders' Equity: 
 Retained earnings 

Federal banking regulatory agencies allow an optional phase-in period of three years for banks to absorb the impact to regulatory capital of implementing CECL. LCNB has elected not to exercise this option, and the full impact of adopting ASC 326 is included in regulatory capital as of September 30, 2024 . Adoption of the ASC did not materially affect LCNB's regulatory capital ratios. 
 
 ASU No. 2022 - 02, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326 ): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures" 
 ASU No. 2022 - 02 was issued in March 2022 and became effective for LCNB on January 1, 2023. These amendments eliminated previous TDR recognition and measurement guidance and, instead, required that an entity evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. The amendments also enhance disclosure requirements and introduce new disclosure requirements for certain modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Additionally, the amendments require the disclosure of current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination. Adoption of ASU No. 2022 - 02 did not have a material impact on LCNB's results of consolidated operations or financial position. 
 
 ASU No. 2023 - 02, "Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323 ): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method (a Consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)" 
 ASU No. 2023 - 02 was issued in March 2023 and became effective for LCNB on January 1, 2024. It allows reporting entities the option to use the proportional amortization method to account for equity investments made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits and other income tax benefits when certain requirements are met, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received. The proportional amortization method was previously limited to Low-Income Housing Tax Credit investments. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and recognizes the net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). Adoption of ASU No. 2023 - 02 did not have a material impact on LCNB's results of consolidated operations or financial position. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET EFFECTIVE 
 From time to time the FASB issues an ASU to communicate changes to U.S. GAAP. The following information provides brief summaries of newly issued but not yet effective ASUs that could have an effect on LCNB s financial position or results of consolidated operations: 
 
 ASU No. 2023 - 07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280 ): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" 
 ASU No. 2023 - 07 was issued in November 2023 and changes the requirements for segment disclosures, primarily through enhancing disclosure requirements for significant segment expenses, enhancing interim disclosure requirements, clarifying circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, providing new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and modifying other disclosure requirements. A public entity should apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Upon transition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. LCNB does not expect adoption of ASU No. 2023 - 02 will have a material impact on its results of consolidated operations or financial position. 
 
 ASU 2023 - 09 Income Taxes (Topic 740 ): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. 
 ASU No. 2023 - 09 was issued in December 2023. The amendments require that public business entities on an annual basis 1 disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation, and 2 provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). The amendments require that all entities disclose on an annual basis the following information about income taxes paid: 1 the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes; and 2 the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). The amendments also require that all entities disclose the following information: 1 income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign; and 2 income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign. The ASU is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. LCNB will adopt this ASU for the reporting period beginning January 1, 2025, and does not expect the amendments to have a material impact to the financial statements of the Company. 
 
 ASU 2024 - 01 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718 - Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards, 
 ASU No. 2024 - 01 was issued in March 2024 and clarifies how an entity determines whether a profits interest or similar award is within the scope of Topic 718 or is not a share-based payment arrangement and, therefore, is within the scope of other guidance. ASU 2024 - 01 provides an illustrative example with multiple fact patterns and also amends certain language in the Scope and Scope Exceptions sections of Topic 718 to improve its clarity and operability without changing the guidance. Entities can apply the amendments either retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements or prospectively to profits interest and similar awards granted or modified on or after the date of adoption. If prospective application is elected, an entity must disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle. ASU 2024 - 01 is effective January 1, 2025, including interim periods, and is not expected to have a material impact to the financial statements of the Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

(Continued)

full-service office in Florence, Kentucky, which became offices of LCNB after the merger. The merger significantly increased LCNB s existing presence in the Cincinnati market and expanded LCNB s community banking franchise across the Ohio River into the Northern Kentucky market. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, LCNB consolidated one of the full-service branches acquired from Cincinnati Federal with a full-service branch acquired from EAGLE.Bank resulting in the closure of one branch office in Cincinnati, Ohio. 
 
 CNNB results of operations were included in LCNB's results beginning November 1, 2023. 
 
 Under the terms of the merger agreement, CNNB shareholders had the opportunity to elect to receive either shares of LCNB Corp. stock or in cash for each share of CNNB common stock owned, subject to the limitation that of the consideration be in the form of LCNB Corp. common stock and of the consideration be in the form of cash. The fair value of the common stock issued as part of the consideration was determined on the basis of the closing price of LCNB Corp.'s common stock on the acquisition date. 

The following table summarizes the fair value of the total consideration transferred as a part of the CNNB acquisition and the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as originally reported at December 31, 2023 and as adjusted at September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 

Common stock 2,042,598 shares issued at 13.99 per share) 
 Fair value of total consideration transferred 
 
 Identifiable Assets Acquired: 
 Cash and cash equivalents 
 Debt securities, available-for-sale 
 Federal Home Loan Bank stock 
 Loans, net 
 Premises and equipment 
 Operating lease right-of-use assets 
 Core deposit and other intangibles 
 Bank owned life insurance 
 Deferred income taxes 82 
 Other assets 
 Total identifiable assets acquired 
 
 Liabilities Assumed: 
 Deposits 
 Short-term borrowings 
 Long-term debt 
 Operating lease liabilities 
 Other liabilities 
 Total liabilities assumed 
 
 Total Identifiable Net Assets Acquired 
 
 Goodwill Resulting From Merger 

The fair value and gross contractual amounts of non-PCD loans as of the acquisition date was million and million, respectively. LCNB recorded a provision for credit losses on these loans of . 
 
 As permitted by ASC No. 805 - 10 - 25, Business Combinations , the above estimated amounts may be adjusted up to one year after the closing date of the transaction to reflect any new information obtained about facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. While the Bank believes that the information available on the merger date provided a reasonable basis for estimating fair value, additional information and evidence may be provided during the fourth quarter of 2024 which will be utilized to finalize all valuations and record final adjustments during the one year subsequent measurement period. These adjustments may include: (i) changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities related to fair value estimates and changes in the expected realization of items considered to be net operating loss carryforwards due to tax calculations still in process, and (ii) changes in goodwill as a result of the net effect of any adjustments. As such, any changes in the estimated fair value of assets, including acquired loans, will be recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. 
 
 The loan adjustment in the table above was due to a fair value adjustment to deferred fees and costs on loans acquired. The other assets, operating lease liabilities and resulting deferred tax adjustments in the table above were related to the updated fair value adjustments. 

The amount of goodwill recorded reflects LCNB's expansion in the Cincinnati market and related synergies that are expected to result from the acquisition and represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill will not be amortizable on LCNB's financial records and will not be deductible for tax purposes.

 Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. 
 On April 12, 2024, LCNB acquired Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. EFBI ), the holding company for EAGLE.bank, an Ohio state-chartered bank. Under the terms of the definitive merger agreement, EFBI merged with and into LCNB Corp., immediately followed by the merger of EAGLE.bank with and into LCNB National Bank. EAGLE.bank operated three full-service banking offices in Cincinnati, Ohio, which became offices of LCNB after the merger. This transaction increased LCNB s presence in the Cincinnati market. 
 
 Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, EFBI shareholders had the opportunity to elect to receive either shares of LCNB Corp. stock, per share in cash for each share of EFBI common stock owned, or a combination thereof subject to at least , but not more than , of the shares of EFBI being exchanged for LCNB common stock. The fair value of the common stock issued as part of the consideration was determined on the basis of the closing price of LCNB's common stock on the acquisition date. 

The following table summarizes the fair value of the total consideration transferred as a part of the EFBI acquisition and the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as originally reported at June 30, 2024 and as adjusted at September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

The fair value and gross contractual amounts of non-PCD loans as of the acquisition date was million and million, respectively. LCNB recorded a provision for credit losses on these loans of . 
 
 As permitted by ASC No. 805 - 10 - 25, Business Combinations, the above estimated amounts may be adjusted up to one year after the closing date of the transaction to reflect any new information obtained about facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. While the Company believes that the information available on the merger date provided a reasonable basis for estimating fair value, additional information and evidence may be provided during the fourth quarter of 2024 or later which will be utilized to finalize all valuations and record final adjustments during the one year subsequent measurement period. These adjustments may include: (i) changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities related to fair value estimates and changes in the expected realization of items considered to be net operating loss carryforwards due to tax calculations still in process, and (ii) changes in goodwill as a result of the net effect of any adjustments. As such, any changes in the estimated fair value of assets will be recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. 
 
 The consideration adjustments are associated with the unearned portion of Eagle.bank's employee stock ownership plan. The other assets, other liabilities and resulting deferred tax adjustments in the table above were related to the updated fair value adjustments. 

The amount of goodwill recorded reflects LCNB's expansion in the Cincinnati market and related synergies that are expected to result from the acquisition and represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill will not be amortizable on LCNB's financial records and will not be deductible for tax purposes. Total goodwill will be subject to an annual test for impairment and the amount impaired, if any, will be charged to expense at the time of impairment. The core deposit intangible will be amortized over the estimated weighted average economic life of the various core deposit types, which is nine years. 
 
 Direct expenses related to the EFBI acquisition totaled and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and totaled and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. They were expensed as incurred and are recorded as merger-related expenses in the consolidated statements of income.

At September 30, 2024 , LCNB s securities portfolio consisted of securities, of which were in an unrealized loss position. At December 31, 2023 , LCNB's securities portfolio consisted of securities, of which were in an unrealized loss position. After considering the issuers of the securities, LCNB management determined that that the unrealized losses were due to changing interest rate environments. LCNB had no intent at September 30, 2024 to sell its debt securities before recovery of their cost basis and as it was more likely than not that it will not be required to sell its debt securities before recovery of their cost basis. 

Each quarter, LCNB performs an analysis to determine if any of the unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities are comprised of credit losses as compared to unrealized losses due to market interest rate adjustments. The assessment includes a review of the unrealized loss for each security issuance held; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including external credit ratings and recent downgrades; and LCNB's ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value. LCNB also considers the extent to which the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies and any guarantee of issued amounts by those agencies. The portfolio continues to consist of a mix of fixed and floating-rate, high quality securities, largely rated AA (or better), displaying an overall effective duration of approximately years. No credit losses were determined to be present as of September 30, 2024 , as there was no credit quality deterioration noted. Therefore, provision for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities was recognized for the third quarter of 2024 . 
 
 Debt securities with a market value of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits and for other purposes required or as permitted by law.

 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
 
 The ACL is an estimate of the expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, which is measured using relevant information about past events, including historical credit loss experience on financial assets with similar risk characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the financial assets. A provision for credit losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of these and other pertinent factors. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016 - 13, including the CECL methodology for estimating the ACL. This standard was adopted using a modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2023. See Note 1 - Basis of Presentation - Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements for a summary of the impact adoption of ASU No. 2016 - 13 had on LCNB's ACL, retained earnings, and deferred taxes. 
 
 QUANTITATIVE CONSIDERATIONS 
 
 The ACL is primarily calculated utilizing a DCF model. Key inputs and assumptions used in this model are discussed below: 
 
 Forecast model - For each portfolio segment, an LDA was performed in order to identify appropriate loss drivers and create a regression model for use in forecasting cash flows. The LDA utilized peer FFIEC Call Report data for all pools. The Company updated the LDA for the September 30, 2024 calculation. The new LDA utilized the same economic factor loss drivers as previous analyses but added an additional factor to three pools to improve correlation with loss data. 

Probability of default PD is the probability that an asset will be in default within a given time frame. The Company has defined default as when a charge-off has occurred, a loan goes to non-accrual status, or a loan is greater than 90 days past due. The forecast model is utilized to estimate PDs. 
 
 Loss given default LGD is the percentage of the asset not expected to be collected due to default. The LGD is derived from company specific and peer loss data. 
 
 Prepayments and curtailments Prepayments and curtailments are calculated based on the Company s own data. This analysis is updated when materially relevant. 
 
 Forecast and reversion the Company, as of June 30, 2024, established a two -quarter reasonable and supportable forecast period with a ten -quarter straight line reversion to the long-term historical average. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company established a four -quarter reasonable and supportable forecast period with a six -quarter straight line reversion to the long-term historical average due to increased uncertainty surrounding the economy. Extending the forecast and shortening the reversion periods from previous quarters has differing effects on pools based on the economic indicators used and the relation of the selected forecast range to the historical average. For example, the historical average for the Company's unemployment indicator is 5.78 , which is higher than the forecasted range utilized as of September 30, 2024 . The extended forecast and reversion period ultimately decreases the reserve associated with the unemployment factor when compared to the historical average. 
 
 Economic forecast the Company utilizes a third party to provide economic forecasts under various scenarios, which are assessed against economic indicators and management s observations in the market. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company selected a forecast which forecasts unemployment between 4.86 and 5.48 , the change in Coincident Economic Activity between - 0.04 and 0.83 , the change in Commercial Real Estate Price Indexes between - 6.45 and - 0.68 , and the change in the Home Price Index between - 4.12 and 2.98 during the forecast periods. Management believes that the resulting quantitative reserve appropriately balances economic indicators with identified risks. As of June 30, 2024, the Company selected a forecast which forecasts unemployment between 4.50 and 4.85 , the change in Coincident Economic Activity between - 0.06 and 0.07 , the change in Commercial Real Estate Price Indexes between - 5.33 and - 3.86 , and the change in the Home Price Index between 0.63 and 2.89 during the forecast periods. The historical averages for LCNB s economic indicators are unemployment 5.78 , change in Coincident Economic Activity 1.99 , change in Commercial Real Estate Price Indexes 5.95 , and change in Home Price Index 2.71 

QUALITATIVE CONSIDERATIONS 
 
 In addition to the quantitative model, management considers the need for qualitative adjustment for risks not considered in the DCF. Factors that are considered by management in determining loan collectability and the appropriate level of the ACL are listed below: 
 
 Actual and expected changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments in which the Company operates that affect the collectability of financial assets; 
 
 The effect of other external factors such as the regulatory, legal and technological environments, competition, and events such as natural disasters or pandemics; and 
 
 Model risk including statistical risk, reversion risk, timing risk, and model limitation risk. 
 
 Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans. 
 
 Lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections, write-offs, and recoveries.

 For collateral dependent loans where management has determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment of the loan is to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date.

The risk characteristics of LCNB's material loan portfolio segments were as follows: 
 
 Commercial Industrial Loans. LCNB s commercial industrial loan portfolio consists of loans for a variety of purposes, including, for example, loans to fund working capital requirements (such as inventory and receivables financing) and purchases of machinery and equipment. LCNB offers a variety of commercial industrial loan arrangements, including term loans, balloon loans, and lines of credit. Commercial industrial loans can have a fixed or variable rate, with maturities ranging from one to ten years. Commercial industrial loans are offered to businesses and professionals for short and medium terms on both a collateralized and uncollateralized basis. Commercial industrial loans typically are underwritten on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the business. Collateral, when obtained, may include liens on furniture, fixtures, equipment, inventory, receivables, or other assets. As a result, such loans involve complexities, variables, and risks that require thorough underwriting and more robust servicing than other types of loans. 
 
 Commercial, Secured by Real Estate Loans. Commercial real estate loans include loans secured by a variety of commercial, retail and office buildings, religious facilities, hotels, multifamily (more than four -family) residential properties, construction and land development loans, and other land loans. Mortgage loans secured by owner-occupied agricultural property are included in this category. Commercial real estate loan products generally amortize over five to twenty-five years and are payable in monthly principal and interest installments. Some have balloon payments due within one to ten years after the origination date. The majority have adjustable interest rates with adjustment periods ranging from one to ten years, some of which are subject to established floor interest rates. 
 
 Commercial real estate loans are underwritten based on the ability of the property, in the case of income-producing property, or the borrower s business to generate sufficient cash flow to amortize the debt. Secondary emphasis is placed upon global debt service, collateral value, financial strength and liquidity of any and all guarantors, and other factors. Commercial real estate loans are generally originated with a to maximum loan to appraised value ratio, depending upon borrower capacity. 
 
 Residential Real Estate Loans. Residential real estate loans include loans secured by first or second mortgage liens on one to four -family residential properties. Home equity lines of credit are also included in this category. First and second mortgage loans are generally amortized over five to thirty years with monthly principal and interest payments. Home equity lines of credit generally have a five year or less draw period with interest only payments followed by a repayment period with monthly payments based on the amount outstanding. LCNB offers both fixed and adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Adjustable-rate loans are available with adjustment periods ranging between one to fifteen years and adjust according to an established index plus a margin, subject to certain floor and ceiling rates. A substantial majority of home equity lines of credit have a variable rate of interest based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a margin. 
 
 Residential real estate loans are underwritten primarily based on the borrower s ability to repay, prior credit history, and the value of the collateral. LCNB generally requires private mortgage insurance for first mortgage loans that have a loan to appraised value ratio of greater than or may require other credit enhancements for second lien mortgage loans. 
 
 Consumer Loans. LCNB s portfolio of consumer loans generally includes secured and unsecured loans to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures. Secured loans include loans to fund the purchase of automobiles, recreational vehicles, boats, and similar acquisitions. Consumer loans made by LCNB generally have fixed rates and terms ranging up to 72 months, depending upon the nature of the collateral, size of the loan, and other relevant factors. Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates, but pose additional risks of collectability and loss when compared to certain other types of loans. Collateral, if present, is generally subject to damage, wear, and depreciation. The borrower s ability to repay is of primary importance in the underwriting of consumer loans. 
 
 Agricultural Loans. LCNB s portfolio of agricultural loans includes loans for financing agricultural production and for financing the purchase of equipment used in the production of agricultural products. LCNB s agricultural loans are generally secured by farm machinery, livestock, crops, vehicles, or other agricultural-related collateral. 
 
 Other Loans, Including Deposit Overdrafts. Other loans may include loans that do not fit in any of the other categories, but it is primarily composed of overdrafts from transaction deposit accounts. Overdraft payments are recorded as a recovery and overdrafts are generally written off after 34 days with a negative balance. 

LCNB s management monitors the credit quality of its loans on an ongoing basis. This monitoring includes annual reviews for loans with a principal balance greater than 1 million and bi-annual reviews for loans with a principal balance of more than 500,000 through 1 million. LCNB also has a loan grade monitoring system in place to track and report loan grades and classifications, enabling the identification and management of non-performing loans. Major factors used in determining loan grades vary based on the nature of the loan, but commonly include factors such as debt service coverage, internal cash flow, liquidity, leverage, operating performance, debt burden, FICO scores, occupancy, interest rate sensitivity, and expense burden. Commercial real estate loans rated OAEM or worse are reviewed at least quarterly for credit deterioration. 
 
 A loan is assigned to a risk category based on relevant information about the ability of the borrower to service the debt including, but not limited to, current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends. The categories used are: 
 
 Pass loans categorized in this category are higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described below. 

Other Assets Especially Mentioned ("OAEM") loans in this category are currently protected but are potentially weak. These loans constitute a risk but not to the point of justifying a classification of substandard. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitute an undue risk in light of the circumstances surrounding a specific asset. 

Substandard loans in this category are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the possibility that LCNB will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful loans classified in this category have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

An independent consultant is contracted to conduct a review of LCNB's loan portfolio on an annual basis. The independent review examines LCNB's underwriting activities, documentation, credit quality, and includes an assessment of proper risk ratings. Loans selected for review include all loans meeting certain pre-determined criteria and a sample of other loans. The independent review provides assurance that LCNB s loan portfolio and credit quality complies with the policies set forth by the board of directors and senior management and with regulatory requirements.

The methodology to derive the fair value of loans at September 30, 2024 is consistent with the methodology utilized to determine the fair value of loans acquired in the Company s recent acquisitions of CNNB and EFBI 

The fair values of off-balance-sheet financial instruments such as loan commitments and letters of credit are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements. The fair values of such instruments were not material at 
 September 30, 2024
 
 and 
 December 31, 2023.

Fair values of financial instruments are based on various assumptions, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Therefore, the fair values presented may not represent amounts that could be realized in actual transactions. In addition, because the required disclosures exclude certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments, any aggregation of the fair value amounts presented would not represent the underlying value of LCNB.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The accounting policies of LCNB conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and require management to make estimates and develop assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related footnotes. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available to management as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ significantly from management s estimates. As this information changes, management s estimates and assumptions used to prepare LCNB s financial statements and related disclosures may also change. The most significant accounting policies followed by LCNB are presented in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in LCNB's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the items described below to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. 
 
 Business Combinations. Assets acquired, including identified intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles, and liabilities assumed as a result of a merger or acquisition transaction are recorded at their estimated fair values. The difference between the consideration paid and the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Management engages third-party specialists to assist in the development of fair value estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions used to value acquired assets and liabilities assumed include, but are not limited to, projected cash flows, future growth rates, repayment rates, default rates and losses assuming default, discount rates, and realizable collateral values. The allowance for credit losses for PCD loans is recognized within acquisition accounting. The allowance for credit losses for non-PCD assets is recognized as provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the merger or acquisition. Fair value adjustments are amortized or accreted into the income statement over the estimated lives of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments determine the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the merger or acquisition. 
 
 Preliminary estimates of fair values may be adjusted for a period of time no greater than one year subsequent to the merger or acquisition date if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the merger or acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Adjustments recorded during this period are recognized in the current reporting period. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. The allowance is maintained at a level LCNB management believes is adequate to absorb estimated credit losses identified and inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is established through a provision for credit losses charged as an expense. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses over the contractual terms in the loan portfolio based on evaluations of the collectability of loans and prior loan loss experience. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current and forecasted economic conditions that may affect the borrowers' ability to pay. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. 
 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU (as subsequently amended by ASU 2018-19) significantly changed how entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. This standard replaced the incurred loss approach with an expected loss model. Referred to as the CECL model, this standard applies to financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. The standard also expanded disclosure requirements regarding an entity s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the allowance. In addition, entities need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 
 
 LCNB adopted CECL effective January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under CECL while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with the incurred loss accounting standards. The transition adjustment of the CECL adoption included an increase in the allowance of 2.4 million, and a 1.9 million decrease to the retained earnings account to reflect the cumulative effect of adopting CECL on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with the 0.5 million tax impact portion being recorded as part of the deferred tax asset in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 Accounting for Intangibles. LCNB s intangible assets are composed primarily of goodwill and core deposit intangibles related to acquisitions of other financial institutions. 
 
 Accounting rules require LCNB to determine the fair value of all the assets and liabilities of an acquired entity and to record their fair values on the date of acquisition. LCNB employs a variety of means in determining fair values, including the use of discounted cash flow analysis, market comparisons and projected future revenue streams. For those items for which management concludes that LCNB has the appropriate expertise to determine fair value, management may choose to use its own calculation of fair value. In other cases, where the fair value is not readily determined, consultation with outside parties is used to determine fair value. Once valuations have been determined, the net difference between the price paid for the acquired entity and the fair value of the balance sheet is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment, with any such impairment recognized in the period identified. A more frequent assessment is performed if there are material changes in the market place or within the organizational structure. 
 
 Core deposit intangibles acquired from business combinations are initially measured at their estimated fair values and are then amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Management evaluates whether triggering events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining useful life or carrying value of the amortizing intangible should be revised. 
 
 Fair Value Accounting for Debt Securities. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Available-for-sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated to determine if the decline in fair value should be recorded in income or in other comprehensive income (loss). LCNB first determines if it intends to sell or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either criteria is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. If neither of these criteria is met, LCNB evaluates whether the decline in fair value resulted from credit factors. In making this determination, management considers, among other factors, the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, any changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security or issuer. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a provision is recorded to the allowance for credit losses. Any decline in fair value not recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. 
 
 Loans Held-For-Sale. Loans held-for-sale LHFS represent mortgage loans intended to be sold in the secondary market and other loans that management has an active plan to sell. LHFS are carried at the lower-of-cost-or-fair value as determined on an aggregate basis by type of loan. Any writedowns to fair value upon the transfer of loans to LHFS are reflected in loan charge-offs. Any further decreases are recognized in non-interest income and increases in fair value above the loan cost basis are not recognized until the loans are sold.

 Results of Operations 
 
 Net income for the respective three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,532,000 (total basic and diluted earnings per share of 0.31) and 7,372,000 (total basic and diluted earnings per share of 0.53). This compares to net income of 4,070,000 (total basic and diluted earnings per share of 0.37) and 12,921,000 (total basic and diluted earnings per share of 1.16) for the same respective three and nine-month periods in 2023. Results for the 2024 periods were affected by the expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. on April 12, 2024 and Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. on November 1, 2023. 
 
 Net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 14,970,000 and 44,082,000, respectively. This compares to net interest income of 13,571,000 and 41,690,000 for the same respective three and nine-month periods in 2023. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to increased loan interest income caused by higher average loan balances and an increase in the average rate earned on the loan portfolio. This increase was partially offset by increased interest expense recognized on higher amounts of average interest-bearing demand and money market deposits, IRA and time certificates, and long-term borrowings and to higher interest expense paid for these liabilities. The higher average loan and deposit balances during the 2024 periods were due to the acquisition of EFBI and CNNB. The increases in average rates earned on loans and paid for deposits and debt is associated with the rapid increase in the Effective Federal Funds Rate. LCNB's tax equivalent net interest margin for the first nine months of 2024 was 2.81 , compared to 3.20 for the same period last year. 
 
 LCNB recorded a provision for credit losses of 660,000 and 1,313,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. This compares to net recoveries of credit losses of 114,000 and 141,000 for the same respective three and nine month periods in 2023. The provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes 763,000 recognized on non-PCD loans acquired through the Eagle Financial Bancorp merger. 
 
 Non-interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6,407,000 and 14,416,000, respectively. This compares to non-interest income of 3,578,000 and 10,805,000 for the same respective periods in 2023. The increase for both the three and nine-month periods was primarily due to higher amounts of fiduciary income, service charges and fees on deposit accounts, bank-owned life insurance income, and net gains recognized on the sale of residential mortgage loans. Partially offsetting non-interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was an 843,000 pretax loss on the sale of approximately 48.9 million of below market rate loans acquired from Cincinnati Bancorp during the second quarter. 

Non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15,387,000 and 48,684,000, respectively, compared to 12,244,000 and 36,847,000 for the same three and nine-month periods in 2023. The increases were primarily due to higher expenses associated with the additional personnel and offices resulting from the acquisitions of Eagle Financial Bancorp and Cincinnati Bancorp and, for the nine month comparative periods, the increase in one-time expenses associated with the two acquisitions.

Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 15,013,000, an increase of 1,396,000 from the comparable period in 2023. Total interest income increased 6,727,000, which was partially offset by an increase in total interest expense of 5,331,000. 
 
 The 6,727,000 increase in total interest income was primarily due to a 6,467,000 increase in loan interest income. The increase in loan interest income was primarily due to a 319.2 million increase in average loan balances and secondarily to a 58 basis point (a basis point equals 0.01 increase in the average rate earned on the loan portfolio due to consistent market rates. Loan balances increased primarily due to loans acquired in the mergers with EFBI and CNNB. 
 
 The 5,331,000 increase in total interest expense was primarily due to a 708,000 increase in interest expense for interest-bearing demand and money market deposits, a 4,299,000 increase in interest expense for IRA and time certificates, and a 1,009,000 increase in interest expense for long-term debt. Interest expense on interest-bearing demand and money market deposits increased primarily due to a 36 basis point increase in the average rate paid for these deposits and secondarily to a 44.3 million increase in average deposit balances. Interest expense on IRA and time certificates increased due to a 308.0 million increase in average deposit balances and to a 121 basis point increase in the average rate paid. Deposit balances increased due to a combination of organic growth and to balances obtained in the mergers with EFBI and CNNB. 
 
 Interest expense on long-term debt increased primarily due to a 85.9 million increase in the average balance outstanding caused by new FHLB advances, which were used to pay down short-term borrowings, promote loan growth, and increase liquidity.

Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 44,202,000, an increase of 2,373,000 from the comparable period in 2023. Total interest income increased 21,813,000, which was partially offset by an increase in total interest expense of 19,440,000. 
 
 The 21,813,000 increase in total interest income was primarily due to a 21,079,000 increase in loan interest income. The increase in loan interest income was primarily due to a 354.7 million increase in average loan balances and secondarily to a 62 basis point increase in the average rate earned on the loan portfolio due to higher market rates. Loan balances increased primarily due to loans acquired in the mergers with EFBI and CNNB. 
 
 The 19,440,000 increase in total interest expense was primarily due to a 5,358,000 increase in interest expense for interest-bearing demand and money market deposits, an 11,498,000 increase in interest expense for IRA and time certificates, and a 4,225,000 increase in interest expense for long-term debt. Interest expense on interest-bearing demand and money market deposits increased primarily due to a 93 basis point increase in the average rate paid for these deposits and secondarily to a 102.9 million increase in average deposit balances. Interest expense on IRA and time certificates increased due to a 257.0 million increase in average deposit balances and to a 165 basis point increase in the average rate paid. Deposit balances increased due to a combination of organic growth and to balances obtained in the mergers with EFBI and CNNB. 
 
 Interest expense on long-term debt increased primarily due to a 120.2 million increase in the average balance outstanding caused by new FHLB advances, which were used to pay down short-term borrowings, promote loan growth, and increase liquidity.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 
 
 Provision and Allowance For Credit Losses 
 
 LCNB continuously reviews the loan portfolio for credit risk through the use of its lending and loan review functions. Independent loan reviews analyze specific loans, providing validation that credit risks are appropriately identified, graded, and reported to the Loan Committee, Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. New credits meeting specific criteria are analyzed prior to origination and are reviewed by the Loan Committee, the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors. 
 
 The total provision for credit losses is determined based upon management's evaluation as to the amount needed to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level considered appropriate in relation to the risk of losses inherent in the portfolio. For analysis purposes, the loan portfolio is separated into pools of similar loans. These pools include commercial and industrial loans, owner occupied commercial real estate loans, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, real estate loans secured by farms, real estate loans secured by multi-family dwellings, residential real estate loans secured by senior liens on 1-4 family dwellings, residential real estate loans secured by junior liens on 1-4 family dwellings, home equity line of credit loans, consumer loans, loans for agricultural purposes not secured by real estate, construction loans secured by 1-4 family dwellings, construction loans secured by other real estate, and several smaller classifications. Within each pool of loans, LCNB examines a variety of factors to determine the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, including historic charge-off percentages, overall pool quality, a review of specific problem loans, current economic trends and conditions that may affect borrowers' ability to pay, and the nature, volume, and consistency of the loan pool. 
 
 LCNB recorded a provision for credit losses of 660,000 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a recovery of credit losses of 114,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The provision for the 2024 period included a provision for credit losses on loans of 681,000 and a recovery of credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures of 22,000. The provision for the 2023 period included a provision for credit losses on loans of 9,000 and a recovery of credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures of 123,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, LCNB recorded a provision for credit losses of 1,313,000, compared to a recovery of credit losses of 141,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The provision for the 2024 nine-month period included a provision for credit losses on loans of 1,300,000 and a provision for off-balance-sheet credit exposures of 11,000. The recovery of credit losses for the 2023 nine-month period included a provision for credit losses on loans of 173,000 and a recovery of credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures of 123,000. 
 
 The provisions for credit losses on loans during the nine-month 2024 period included 763,000 recognized on non-PCD loans acquired through the EFBI merger and a 1.2 million increase for a commercial real estate, non-owner occupied loan that was individually evaluated for the first time during the first quarter 2024. These increases were largely offset by a recovery of credit losses in the pooled real estate mortgage loan category. The residential real estate mortgage loan category had a recovery of credit losses primarily due to a decrease in loan balances caused by a transfer to the loans held-for-sale category. 
 
 Calculating an appropriate level for the allowance and provision for credit losses involves a high degree of management judgment and is, by its nature, imprecise. Revisions may be necessary as more information becomes available or if market conditions change. 
 
 Net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 84,000 and 147,000, respectively, compared to net charge-offs of 34,000 and 83,000 for the respective periods in 2023.

Reasons for changes include: 

Fiduciary income increased primarily due to increases in the fair values of trust and brokerage assets managed, on which fees are based. The increases in fair value are due to the opening of new Wealth Management customer accounts and to an increase in the market values of managed assets. 

Service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased primarily due to increases in check card income, ATM usage fees, and fee income received on the ICS product, partially offset by a decrease in overdraft fees and deposit account fees in general. LCNB reduced overdraft fees from 35 per occurrence to 25 effective November 1, 2023. 

Net losses from sales of debt securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect losses recognized on the sale of municipal securities with an amortized cost basis of approximately 9.8 million. 

Bank-owned life insurance ("BOLI") income increased primarily due to mortality proceeds recognized during 2024. The 2023 periods did not include mortality proceeds. Other BOLI income increased to a lesser extent due to insurance policies acquired in the mergers with EFBI and CNNB. 

Net gains from sales of loans increased due to a higher volume of residential real estate loan sales. Partially offsetting these gains for the nine-month period was an 843,000 pretax loss on the sale of approximately 48.9 million of below market rate loans acquired from CNNB. 

Other operating income decreased during the nine-month period primarily due to an increase in amortization of capitalized mortgage servicing rights, which amortization is netted for accounting purposes against fee income recognized from the servicing of sold residential mortgage loans.

Reasons for changes include: 

Salaries and employee benefits increased due to overall wage and benefit increases, an increased number of employees due to the acquisition of EFBI and CNNB, higher sales commissions, and higher health insurance costs. 

Occupancy expense increased primarily due to increased utility and depreciation expenses caused by the additional offices acquired from EFBI and CNNB. Maintenance and repair costs related to LCNB's office facilities also contributed to the increase for the nine-month period. 

Amortization of intangibles increased due to the amortization of core deposit intangibles recognized from the acquisitions of EFBI and CNNB. 

FDIC insurance premiums increased due to a higher assessment base, partially reflecting increased assets resulting from the acquisitions of EFBI and CNNB, and to an increase in the assessment rate charged. 

Merger-related expenses reflect costs incurred in connection with the acquisitions of EFBI and CNNB. 

Other non-interest expense for the 2024 third quarter benefited from a 454,000 gain recognized on the sale of a closed office building. Likewise, the 2023 second quarter benefited from a 425,000 gain recognized on the sale of a closed office building. The remaining net increases for the three and nine-month periods can be attributed to smaller increases in various other accounts. 

Income Taxes 
 
 LCNB's effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.0 and 13.3 , respectively, compared to 18.9 and 18.2 for the same respective periods in 2023. The difference between the statutory rate of 21 and the effective tax rates is primarily due to tax-exempt interest income from municipal securities, tax-exempt earnings from bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt earnings from LCNB Risk Management, Inc., and tax credits and losses related to investments in affordable housing tax credit limited partnerships. The effective tax rates for 2024 were lower due to tax-exempt items not decreasing in proportion to the overall decrease in earnings.

NM - Not Meaningful 
 
 Reasons for changes include: 

Available-for-sale debt securities decreased due to maturities, paydowns, sales, and calls, partially offset by purchases of new securities and increases in market valuation. 

Net loans decreased primarily due to loans transferred to the held-for-sale category, partially offset by the addition of loans acquired through the merger with EFBI. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 104.3 million of single-family residential loans were sold in secondary market.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Goodwill increased primarily due to additional goodwill recorded as a result of the merger with EFBI and secondarily to goodwill adjustments for the merger with CNNB. 

Core deposit and other intangibles increased due to the addition of a core deposit intangible rights obtained in the merger with EFBI. 

Total deposits increased due to a combination of deposits acquired through the merger with EFBI and through organic deposit growth. There was, however, significant movement from non-interest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing deposits during 2023 and 2024, likely due to the increases in market rates. 

Long-term debt increased due to additional advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati. The new debt was used to pay down short-term borrowings and to support growth in liquidity and the loan portfolio. 

Common shares increased primarily due to stock issued as part of the acquisition price for EFBI. 

Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes decreased because of market-driven partial recoveries in the fair value of LCNB's available-for-sale debt securities investments. 

LCNB's loan portfolio represents its largest asset category and is its most significant source of interest income. Loan classifications have been identified as Commercial Industrial, Commercial Real Estate, Residential Real Estate, Consumer, Agricultural, and Other. Commercial real estate is the largest classification in LCNB's loan portfolio, comprising about 64 of total loans at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Loans secured by commercial real estate consist of owner-occupied, non-owner-occupied, farmland, multi-family, and construction loans. A commercial real estate, owner-occupied loan finances the purchase, construction, or refinance of a building or other property for which the repayment of principal is dependent upon cash flows from ongoing operations conducted by the party, or an affiliate of the party, who owns the property. A commercial real estate, non-owner occupied loan finances the purchase, construction or refinance of a building or other property for which the repayment of principal is dependent upon rental income associated with the property or the subsequent sale of the property. The values of these loans are primarily impacted by the level of interest rates associated with the debt and to local economic conditions, which dictate occupancy rates and the amount of rent charged. The increase in debt service due to higher interest rates may not be able to be passed on to tenants. As part of the origination process, loan interest rates and occupancy rates are stressed to determine the impact on the borrower s ability to maintain adequate debt service under different economic conditions. Further, LCNB monitors the concentration in any one industry and has established limits relative to the total of the Bank's tier 1 and tier 2 capital for each category of loan. Credit quality trends are monitored by industry to determine if a change in the risk exposure to a certain industry may warrant a change in underwriting standards.

Regulatory Capital 
 
 The Bank must meet certain minimum capital requirements set by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Company's and the Bank's financial statements. LCNB s and the Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 
 In addition to the minimum capital requirements, a financial institution needs to maintain a Capital Conservation Buffer composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital of at least 2.5 above its minimum risk-weighted capital requirements to avoid limitations on its ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments to shareholders and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. A financial institution with a buffer below 2.5 is subject to increasingly stringent limitations on capital distributions as the buffer approaches zero. 
 
 For various regulatory purposes, financial institutions are classified into categories based upon capital adequacy:

As of the most recent notification from their regulators, the Bank and LCNB were categorized as "well-capitalized" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since the last notification that would change the Bank's or LCNB's category.

Qualifications for community banking organizations to use a simplified measure of capital adequacy approach include having a tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9 , less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets, and limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities. A qualifying community banking organization that opts into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio framework and meets all requirements under the framework will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations and will not be required to report or calculate risk-based capital. LCNB qualifies to use the simplified measure, but did not opt in for the September 30, 2024 regulatory capital calculations. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 LCNB Corp. depends on dividends from the Bank for the majority of its liquid assets, including the cash needed to pay dividends to its shareholders. Federal banking law limits the amount of dividends the Bank may pay to the sum of retained net income for the current year plus retained net income for the previous two years. Prior approval from the OCC, the Bank's primary regulator, is necessary for the Bank to pay dividends in excess of this amount. If dividends exceed net income for a year, a bank is generally not required to carry forward the negative amount resulting from such excess if the bank can attribute the excess to the preceding two years. If the excess is greater than the Bank's previously undistributed net income for the preceding two years, prior OCC approval of the dividend is required and a negative amount would be carried forward in future dividend calculations. In addition, dividend payments may not reduce capital levels below minimum regulatory guidelines. 
 
 At December 31, 2023, the Bank had paid 650,000 in excess of the previous two years' Bank net income to the holding company due to an 8.75 million dividend for the acquisition of CNNB. In addition, dividend payments during 2024 were also in excess of the previous two years' Bank net income due to a 10.5 million dividend for the acquisition of EFBI. The Company does not expect the excess dividends will result in any adverse supervisory action by the OCC. 
 
 Effective liquidity management ensures that cash is available to meet the cash flow needs of borrowers and depositors, pay dividends to shareholders, and meet LCNB's operating cash needs. Primary funding sources include customer deposits with the Bank, short-term and long-term borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, line of credit arrangements totaling 115.0 million with three correspondent banks, and interest and repayments received from LCNB's loan and investment portfolios. In addition, LCNB has approximately 162 million in off-balance sheet insured cash sweeps immediately available for liquidity. 
 
 Total remaining borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank at September 30, 2024 was approximately 120.9 million. Additional borrowings of approximately 115.0 million were available through line of credit arrangements with correspondent banks. 
 
 Management closely monitors the level of liquid assets available to meet ongoing funding needs. It is management's intent to maintain adequate liquidity so that sufficient funds are readily available at a reasonable cost. LCNB experienced no liquidity or operational problems as a result of current liquidity levels. Management believes LCNB has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its requirements in the short and long-term. 
 
 Commitments to extend credit at September 30, 2024 totaled 349.8 million and are more fully described in Note 11 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to LCNB's condensed consolidated financial statements. Since many commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash required to satisfy the commitment reported prior to its expiration.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Market risk for LCNB is primarily due to interest rate risk. LCNB attempts to mitigate this risk through asset/liability management strategies designed to decrease the vulnerability of its earnings to material and prolonged changes in interest rates. LCNB does not use derivatives such as interest rate swaps, caps, or floors to hedge this risk. LCNB has not entered into any market risk instruments for trading purposes. 
 
 The Bank's Asset and Liability Management Committee primarily uses a combination of Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis ("IRSA") and Economic Value of Equity ("EVE") analysis for measuring and managing interest rate risk. IRSA is used to estimate the effect on net interest income ("NII") during a one-year period of instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates, also called interest rate shocks, of 100, 200, and 300 basis points. The base projection uses a current interest rate scenario. As shown below, the September 30, 2024 IRSA indicates that an increase in interest rates or a decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points will have a negative effect on NII and a decrease in interest rates of 200 or 300 basis points will have a positive effect on NII. The changes in NII for all rate assumptions are within LCNB's acceptable ranges.

The IRSA shows the effect on NII during a one-year period only. A more long-range model is the EVE analysis, which shows, accounting for the same rate shocks, the estimated present value of future cash inflows from interest-earning assets less the present value of future cash outflows for interest-bearing liabilities for the same rate shocks. As shown below, the September 30, 2024 EVE analysis indicates that an increase in interest rates will have a negative effect on the EVE and a decrease in interest rates will have a positive effect on the EVE. The changes in the EVE for all upward rate shocks are within LCNB's acceptable ranges. The changes in the EVE for the down 200 and 300 basis point rate shocks are outside LCNB's acceptable ranges as shown below. Management has determined the downward shifts would be acceptable, despite being outside of acceptable ranges, due to the positive nature of the results with respect to cash flows.

The IRSA and EVE simulations discussed above are not projections of future income or equity and should not be relied on as being indicative of future operating results. Assumptions used, including the nature and timing of interest rate levels, yield curve conditions, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, and reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flows, are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely measure future NII or equity. Furthermore, the models do not reflect actions that borrowers, depositors, and management may take in response to changing economic conditions and interest rate levels.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 a) Disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of LCNB's disclosure controls and procedures that ensure that information relating to LCNB required to be disclosed by LCNB in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to LCNB's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, in order to allow timely decisions to be made regarding required disclosures. Based upon this evaluation, these officers have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, LCNB's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in LCNB's internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, LCNB's internal control over financial reporting.

 Except for routine litigation incidental to its business, LCNB is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings and none of its property is the subject of any material proceedings. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Readers should carefully consider the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in LCNB's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 During the period covered by this report, LCNB did not sell any of its securities that were not registered under the Securities Act. 
 
 Under the Issuer Stock Repurchase Plan Agreement (the "Plan"), LCNB may purchase common shares through various means such as open market transactions, including block purchases and privately negotiated transactions. The number of shares repurchased and the timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases are determined at LCNB's discretion. Factors include, but are not limited to, share price, trading volume, and general market conditions, along with LCNB s general business conditions. The Plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate LCNB to acquire any specific number of its common shares. 
 
 As part of the Plan, LCNB entered into a trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The 10b5-1 trading plan permits common shares to be repurchased at times that LCNB might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or self-imposed trading restrictions. The 10b5-1 trading plan is administered by an independent broker and is subject to price, market volume, and timing restrictions.
