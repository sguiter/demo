SANARA
MEDTECH INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

operating and reportable segment. During
the second quarter of 2024, the Company changed its reportable segments to reflect the manner in which the business is managed.
Based on the growing importance of the value-based wound care program to the Company s future outlook and how the Company s
chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, reviews operating results and makes decisions about resource allocation,
the Company now has reportable segments: Sanara Surgical and THP. 

Sanara
Surgical 

The
Sanara Surgical segment primarily markets and sells soft tissue repair and bone fusion products for use in the operating room or other
sterile environments. Sanara Surgical s soft tissue repair products include, among other products, the Company s lead product,
CellerateRX Surgical Activated Collagen CellerateRX Surgical ), and BIASURGE Advanced Surgical Solution, which is a no-rinse,
advanced surgical solution used for wound irrigation. Sanara Surgical s bone fusion products include, among other products, BiFORM,
which is an osteoconductive, bioactive, porous implant that allows for bony ingrowth across the graft site, and ALLOCYTE Plus, which
is a human allograft cellular bone matrix containing bone-derived progenitor cells and conformable bone fibers. 

Sanara
Surgical also includes an in-house research and development team (Rochal Technologies) with an extensive pipeline of innovative products
under development. 

Tissue
Health Plus 

The
THP segment is focused on value-based wound care services. Through THP, the Company plans to offer a first of its kind value-based wound
care program to payers and risk-bearing entities such as accountable care organizations and VBC primary care companies, with Medicare
Advantage payers as the initial target market for this program. 

THP s
programs are expected to enable payers to divest wound care spend risk, reduce wound related hospitalizations and improve patient quality
of life. THP plans to coordinate delivery of community and home-based wound care for its managed patients. Community-based care spans
a variety of settings including physician offices, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and senior living facilities.
THP s programs are intended to integrate science and evidence-based medicine protocols to standardize wound prevention and treatment. 

As
a result of the change in reportable segments, certain prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation.
Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless otherwise indicated, amounts and activity reflect reclassifications related to
the Company s change in reportable segments. The change in reportable segments had no impact on the Company s previously
reported Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows or Consolidated Statements
of Shareholders Equity.

and during the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
allowance for credit losses was at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. Credit loss reserves are maintained
based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due and a detailed review of certain individual customer
accounts. The Company also establishes other allowances to provide for estimated customer rebates and other expected customer deductions.
These allowances totaled at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. If circumstances related to customers change,
estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted. 

and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and
 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventory
had a balance of at September 30, 2024, and at December 31, 2023.

Level
2 Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly
observable as of the reported date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.
These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities,
time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic
measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be
derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments
in this category generally include nonexchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, options and collars. 

Level
3 Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used
with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value. 

The
carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, other than acquisition-related expenses, approximate
fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of acquisition-related accrued expenses is categorized
as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The value of these instruments has been estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on
the Company s incremental borrowing rate. The carrying value of the Company s CRG Term Loan (defined below), which has a
fixed interest rate approximates fair value based on instruments with similar terms (Level 2 inputs). The carrying value of the Company s
Cadence Term Loan (defined below), which had variable interest rates determined each month, approximates fair value based on instruments
with similar terms (Level 2 inputs). The fair value of the contingent earnout consideration and the acquisition date fair value of goodwill
and intangibles related to the acquisitions discussed in Notes 3 and 5 are based on Level 3 inputs. 

Liabilities
for contingent consideration for the Precision Healing merger, acquisition of Scendia and Applied Asset Purchase (defined below) (see
Note 3 for more information) are measured at fair value each reporting period, with the acquisition-date fair value included as part
of the consideration transferred. The contingent consideration for the Scendia acquisition was settled as of September 30, 2024, and
the final earnout payment of approximately 1.1 million was paid in cash in October 2024. Subsequent changes in fair value for the Precision
Healing merger are reported under the line item captioned Change in fair value of earnout liabilities in the Company s
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Due to the Applied Asset Purchase being accounted for as an asset acquisition and given that the
transaction did not include contingent shares, subsequent revaluations of contingent consideration for the Applied Asset Purchase results
in an adjustment to the contingent consideration liability and the intellectual property intangible asset with a cumulative catch-up
amortization adjustment. The current year change in fair value of earnout liability below is as a result of a net increase in the estimated
fair value of the earnout liability established at the time of the Company s Precision Healing merger. The current year revaluation
of earnout liability below is a result of an increase in the estimated value of the earnout liability established at the time of the
Applied Asset Purchase. The following table sets forth a summary of the changes in fair value for the Level 3 contingent earnout considerations.

million, consisting of (i) million in
cash (the Cash Closing Consideration ), (ii) shares of the Company s common stock (the Stock Closing
Consideration with an agreed upon value of million and (iii) million in cash (the Installment Payments ),
to be paid in four equal installments on each of the next four anniversaries of the closing of the Applied Asset Purchase (the Closing ).
The first Installment Payment of was made in August 2024. 

Prior
to the Closing, the Company licensed certain of its products from Applied through a sublicense agreement (the Sublicense Agreement with CGI Cellerate RX, LLC CGI Cellerate RX ), a related party (see Note 11 for additional information regarding transactions
with related parties). Pursuant to the Sublicense Agreement, the Company had an exclusive, world-wide sublicense to distribute certain
hydrolyzed collagen products, including CellerateRX Surgical, into the surgical and wound care markets. In connection with the Applied
Asset Purchase, Applied assigned its license agreement with CGI Cellerate RX to SMAT (the License Agreement ), and on October
10, 2024, the License Agreement and the Sublicense Agreement were terminated for no additional consideration. 

In
addition to the Cash Closing Consideration, Stock Closing Consideration and Installment Payments, the Applied Purchase Agreement provides
that the Sellers are entitled to receive up to an additional million (the Applied Earnout ), which is payable to the
Sellers in cash, upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to SMAT s collections from net sales of a collagen-based
product currently under development. Upon expiration of the seventh anniversary of the Closing, to the extent the Sellers have not earned
the entirety of the Applied Earnout, SMAT shall pay the Sellers a pro-rata amount of the Applied Earnout based on collections from net
sales of the product, with such amount to be due credited against any Applied Earnout payments already made by SMAT (the True-Up
Payment ). The Applied Earnout, minus the True-Up Payment and any Applied Earnout payments already made by SMAT, may be earned
at any point in the future, including after the True-Up Payment is made. 

In
connection with the Applied Asset Purchase and pursuant to the Applied Purchase Agreement, effective August 1, 2023, the Company entered
into a professional services agreement (the Petito Services Agreement with the Owner, pursuant to which the Owner, as
an independent contractor, agreed to provide certain services to the Company, including, among other things, assisting with the development
of products already in development and assisting with research, development, formulation, invention and manufacturing of any future products
(the Petito Services ). 

The
Petito Services Agreement has an initial term of three years and is subject to automatic successive one-month renewals unless earlier
terminated in accordance with its terms. The Petito Services Agreement may be terminated upon the Owner s death or disability or
by the Company or the Owner For Cause (as defined in the Petito Services Agreement); provided, however, that the base salary
described in (i) of the foregoing paragraph shall survive termination through the three-year initial term and the royalty payments and
incentive payments described in (ii)-(v) of the foregoing paragraph shall survive termination of the Petito Services Agreement. 

As
the contingent consideration was negotiated as part of the transfer of assets, the contingent obligation was measured at fair value and
included in the total purchase consideration transferred. Accordingly, since the Applied Asset Purchase was accounted for as an asset
acquisition and did not include contingent shares, the contingent consideration is classified as a liability at its estimated fair value
at each reporting period with subsequent revaluations recognized as an adjustment to the intellectual property intangible asset and the
earnout liability with a cumulative catch-up amortization adjustment.

Direct transaction costs 

Total purchase consideration 

Based
on guidance provided by ASC 805, Business Combinations ASC 805 ), the Company recorded the Applied Asset Purchase as an
asset acquisition due to the determination that substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired was concentrated in a group of
similar identifiable assets. The Company believes the substantially all criterion was met with respect to the acquired
intellectual property being the only significant asset acquired. Accordingly, the Company accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition. 

The
purchase consideration, plus transaction costs, was allocated to the individual assets according to their fair values as a percentage
of the total fair value of the assets purchased, with no goodwill recognized. Based on the estimated fair value of the gross assets acquired,
the total fair value of the net assets acquired was primarily attributable to, and classified as, finite-lived intellectual property
in the third quarter of 2023. The total purchase consideration was allocated based on the relative estimated fair value of such assets
as follows:

the unaffiliated entity. The loan was initially set to be repaid on . However, the Company extended the
repayment date to . On October 1, 2024, the loan began
bearing interest at 
per annum. Pursuant to the convertible loan agreement, the Company has the option to convert the outstanding balance of the loan
into noncontrolling equity interests of the unaffiliated entity upon satisfactory completion of certain due diligence activities.
The loan is recorded under the caption Convertible loan receivable on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets, which was

of September 30, 2024.

In
connection with the change in reportable operating segments, the Company reassessed goodwill with respect to the change in reportable
operating segments as they are presented in this report. Goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisition of Scendia and is included
entirely within the Sanara Surgical segment. The Company s assessment determined that these changes, or any other matters noted,
did not alter the Company s conclusion that goodwill is not impaired as of September 30, 2024 or for the periods then ended.

Statements of Operations. 

operating and reportable segment. During the second
quarter of 2024, the Company changed its reportable segments to better align its organization based upon the Company s management
structure, products and services offered and markets served. Based on the growing importance of the value-based wound care program to
the Company s future outlook and how the Company s chief operating decision maker CODM ), the Chief Executive
Officer, reviews operating results and makes decisions about resource allocation, the Company now has reportable segments: Sanara
Surgical and THP. 

Segment
EBITDA is the primary profitability measure used by the CODM for purposes of assessing financial performance and resource
allocation. The Company defines Segment EBITDA for the reportable segments as net income (loss) excluding interest expense/income,
provision/benefit for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash share-based compensation expense, change in fair value
of earnout liabilities, share of losses from equity method investment, executive separation costs, legal and diligence expenses
related to acquisitions, and gains/losses on disposal of property and equipment as each are applicable to the periods
presented. Segment EBITDA, as it relates to the Company s reportable segments, is presented in conformity with ASC 280,
Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange
Commission s Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K. Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
reported by other companies. 

Sanara
Surgical 

The
Sanara Surgical segment primarily markets and sells soft tissue repair and bone fusion products for use in the operating room or other
sterile environments. Sanara Surgical s soft tissue repair products include, among other products, the Company s lead product,
CellerateRX Surgical, and BIASURGE Advanced Surgical Solution, which is a no-rinse, advanced surgical solution used for wound irrigation.
Sanara Surgical s bone fusion products include, among other products, BiFORM, which is an osteoconductive, bioactive, porous implant
that allows for bony ingrowth across the graft site, and ALLOCYTE Plus, which is a human allograft cellular bone matrix containing bone-derived
progenitor cells and conformable bone fibers. 

Sanara
Surgical also includes an in-house research and development team (Rochal Technologies) with an extensive pipeline of innovative products
under development. 

Tissue
Health Plus 

The
THP segment is focused on value-based wound care services. Through THP, the Company plans to offer a first of its kind value-based wound
care program to payers and risk-bearing entities such as accountable care organizations and VBC primary care companies, with Medicare
Advantage payers as the initial target market for this program. 

THP s
programs are expected to enable payers to divest wound care spend risk, reduce wound related hospitalizations and improve patient quality
of life. THP plans to coordinate delivery of community and home-based wound care for its managed patients. Community based care spans
a variety of settings including physician offices, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and senior living facilities.
THP programs are intended to integrate science and evidence-based medicine protocols to standardize wound prevention and treatment. 

Currently,
there are no allocated costs included in the THP segment. All corporate and overhead expenses are included in the Sanara Surgical segment,
as substantially all of those costs relate to supporting the operations and activities of the Sanara Surgical segment. 

As
a result of the change in reportable segments, certain prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation.
Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless otherwise indicated, amounts and activity reflect reclassifications related to
the Company s change in reportable segments. The change in reportable segments had no impact on the Company s previously
reported Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows or Consolidated Statements
of Shareholders Equity.

OVERVIEW 

We
are a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing transformative technologies to improve clinical outcomes and
reduce healthcare expenditures in the surgical, chronic wound and skincare markets. Our products, services and technologies are designed
to achieve our goal of providing better clinical outcomes at a lower overall cost for patients regardless of where they receive care.
We strive to be one of the most innovative and comprehensive providers of effective surgical, wound and skincare solutions and are continually
seeking to expand our offerings for patients requiring treatments across the entire continuum of care in the United States. 

We
currently market several products across surgical and chronic wound care applications and have multiple products in our pipeline. On
August 1, 2023, we acquired, among other things, the underlying intellectual property of, as well as the rights to manufacture and sell,
CellerateRX Surgical Activated Collagen CellerateRX Surgical ), our primary product, from Applied Nutritionals, LLC Applied for human wound care use (for more information regarding this acquisition, see the Recent Acquisitions section below).
Prior to such time, we had licensed the rights to these products through a sublicense agreement (the Sublicense Agreement with CGI Cellerate RX, LLC CGI Cellerate RX ), an affiliate of The Catalyst Group, Inc. Catalyst ), both
of which are related parties (for additional information regarding related parties, see the section titled Material Transactions
with Related Parties below). In connection with the asset purchase, Applied assigned its license agreement with CGI Cellerate
RX (the License Agreement to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and on October 10, 2024, we terminated the legacy
License Agreement and Sublicense Agreement. We also license certain products from Rochal Industries, LLC Rochal and Cook
Biotech Inc. 

In
April 2022, we entered into a merger agreement through which Precision Healing Inc. Precision Healing became a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company. Precision Healing is developing a diagnostic imager and lateral flow assay LFA for assessing
a patient s wound and skin conditions. This comprehensive wound and skin assessment technology is designed to quantify biochemical
markers to determine the trajectory of a wound s condition to enable better diagnosis and treatment protocol. In December 2023,
we received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the Precision Healing diagnostic imager. We are currently
evaluating regulatory pathways for the Precision Healing LFA. 

In
July 2022, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with Scendia Biologics, LLC Scendia and Ryan Phillips Phillips pursuant to which we acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Scendia from Phillips.
Since our acquisition of Scendia, we have been selling a full line of regenerative and orthobiologic technologies including (i) TEXAGEN
Amniotic Membrane Allograft TEXAGEN ), (ii) BiFORM Bioactive Moldable Matrix BiFORM ), (iii) ACTIGEN Verified
Inductive Bone Matrix ACTIGEN and (iv) ALLOCYTE Plus Advanced Cellular Bone Matrix ALLOCYTE Plus ). 

In
November 2022, we established a 50/50 joint venture, SI Healthcare Technologies, LLC SI Technologies (formerly known as SI Wound
Care, LLC), with InfuSystem Holdings, Inc. InfuSystem focused on delivering a complete wound care solution targeted at
improving patient outcomes, lowering the cost of care, and increasing patient and provider satisfaction. The partnership is expected
to enable InfuSystem to offer innovative products, including our advanced wound care product line and associated services to new customers. 

36 

In
November 2023, we launched BIASURGE Advanced Surgical Solution BIASURGE ). BIASURGE is a no-rinse, advanced surgical solution
used for wound irrigation. It contains an antimicrobial preservative effective against a broad spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms.
BIASURGE is indicated for use in the mechanical cleansing and removal of debris, including microorganisms, from surgical wounds. 

COMPREHENSIVE
VALUE-BASED CARE STRATEGY 

In
June 2020, we formed a subsidiary, United Wound and Skin Solutions, LLC (formerly known as WounDerm ), to hold certain investments
and operations in wound and skincare virtual consult services. In 2023, WounDerm was renamed and is now doing business as Tissue
Health Plus THP ). THP is continuing its current mission to simplify skin health, starting with wound care through
a refined business plan. Through THP, we plan to offer a first of its kind value-based wound care program to payers and risk-bearing
entities such as accountable care organizations and value-based care VBC primary care companies, with Medicare Advantage
payers as the initial target market for this program. 

THP s
programs are expected to enable payers to divest wound care spend risk, reduce wound related hospitalizations and improve patient quality
of life. THP plans to coordinate delivery of community and home-based wound care for its managed patients. Community based care spans
a variety of settings including physician offices, skilled nursing homes, assisted living facilities and senior living facilities. THP s
programs are intended to integrate science and evidence-based medicine protocols to standardize wound prevention and treatment. 

We
anticipate that THP s customer contracts will have three-to-five-year terms. These contracts are expected to incorporate a mix
of value-based pricing methodologies including episodic, per member per month , and fee for value pricing.
We believe this approach is aligned with the financial goals of the payers and will help deliver outstanding clinical outcomes for the
patients. 

Our
vision for our comprehensive approach consists of three key sets of planned capabilities: 

(a) 
 Care
 Hub This virtual patient monitoring, care coordination and navigation center is expected to help doctors and nurses support
 their patients throughout their wound care journey, from prevention to treatment. We expect to have Care Hub staffed by wound care
 certified nurse practitioners NPs and registered nurses RNs ), incorporating care delivery best practices
 from partnerships with Direct Dermatology Inc. and certain physician-led multispecialty wound care groups. With NPs leading the care
 hub, RNs are expected to be the wound specialists, providing patients with expert review and support of the overarching plan of care
 on each patient s journey through the process. In addition, care navigators are expected to serve as a primary point of contact
 for patients and their providers, coordinating care, managing appointments and ensuring seamless communication among all team members. 

(b) 
 Managed
 Services Organization MSO Network With respect to patient-side wound care, our plan is that THP s
 programs would be performed by a network of third-party providers who will be contracted through managed services agreements. These
 providers would include podiatrists, wound care provider groups, primary care physicians and home health agencies. The providers
 in the THP network are expected to leverage THP s standard of care, patient education and tools to deliver optimal patient
 outcomes with high predictability and efficiency. 

(c) 
 Technology
 Platform THP s technology platform will focus on scaling workflows of THP s Care Hub and MSO Network through
 automation and integration. We expect the THP technology platform to enable enhanced patient empowerment and self-healthcare. We
 anticipate that our platform will leverage our technology investments and partnerships with Precision Healing, Pixalere Healthcare,
 Inc. Pixalere and others, by leveraging modern technology including artificial intelligence and machine learning.
 Our platform technology is expected to manage program economics, standards of care, patient monitoring, wound assessments, network
 performance monitoring, and revenue cycle management. We expect that each of these components will work in concert with each other,
 constantly improving economics and care delivery. 

We
are seeking partners to facilitate commercialization of THP and share in the cost of development of the program.

CHANGE
IN REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 

Historically,
we managed our business on the basis of one operating and reportable segment. During the second quarter of 2024, we changed our reportable
segments to reflect a change in the manner in which the business is managed. Based on the growing importance of the value-based wound
care program to our future outlook and how our chief operating decision maker CODM ), the Chief Executive Officer, reviews
operating results and makes decisions about resource allocation, we now have two reportable segments: Sanara Surgical and THP. 

Sanara
Surgical 

The
Sanara Surgical segment primarily markets and sells soft tissue repair and bone fusion products for use in the operating room or other
sterile environments. Sanara Surgical s soft tissue repair products include, among other products, our lead product, CellerateRX
Surgical, and BIASURGE, which is a no-rinse, advanced surgical solution used for wound irrigation. Sanara Surgical s bone fusion
products include, among other products, BiFORM, which is an osteoconductive, bioactive, porous implant that allows for bony ingrowth
across the graft site, and ALLOCYTE Plus, which is a human allograft cellular bone matrix containing bone-derived progenitor cells and
conformable bone fibers. 

Sanara
Surgical also includes an in-house research and development team (Rochal Technologies) with an extensive pipeline of innovative products
under development. 

Tissue
Health Plus 

The
THP segment is focused on value-based wound care services. Through THP, we plan to offer a first of its kind value-based wound care program
to payers and risk-bearing entities such as accountable care organizations and VBC primary care companies, with Medicare Advantage payers
as the initial target market for this program. 

THP s
programs are expected to enable payers to divest wound care spend risk, reduce wound related hospitalizations and improve patient quality
of life. THP plans to coordinate delivery of community and home-based wound care for its managed patients. Community based care spans
a variety of settings including physician offices, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and senior living facilities.
THP programs are intended to integrate science and evidence-based medicine protocols to standardize wound prevention and treatment. 

See
the section titled Results of Operations below for more information regarding our reportable segments. As a result of this
change, certain prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. Throughout this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, unless otherwise indicated, amounts and activity reflect reclassifications related to our change in reportable segments. 

RECENT
ACQUISITIONS 

Applied
Asset Purchase 

On
August 1, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Applied Purchase Agreement by and among the Company,
as guarantor, Sanara MedTech Applied Technologies, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company SMAT ), Applied, The Hymed
Group Corporation Hymed and together with Applied, the Sellers ), and Dr. George D. Petito (the Owner ),
pursuant to which SMAT acquired certain assets of the Sellers and the Owner, including, among others, the Sellers and Owner s
inventory, intellectual property, manufacturing and related equipment, goodwill, rights and claims, other than certain excluded assets,
all as more specifically set forth in the Applied Purchase Agreement (collectively, the Applied Purchased Assets ), and
assumed certain Assumed Liabilities (as defined in the Applied Purchase Agreement), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Applied Purchase Agreement (such transaction, the Applied Asset Purchase ). The Applied Purchased Assets include
the underlying intellectual property of, as well as the rights to manufacture and sell, certain hydrolyzed collagen products, including
CellerateRX Surgical, for human wound care use. 

The
Applied Purchased Assets were purchased for an initial aggregate purchase price of 15.25 million, consisting of (i) 9.75 million
in cash (the Cash Closing Consideration ), (ii) 73,809 shares of our common stock (the Stock Closing
Consideration with an agreed upon value of 3.0 million and (iii) 2.5 million in cash (the Installment
Payments ), to be paid in four equal installments on each of the next four anniversaries of the closing of the Applied Asset
Purchase (the Closing ). The first Installment Payment of 625,000 was made in August 2024. 

38 

In
addition to the Cash Closing Consideration, Stock Closing Consideration and Installment Payments, the Applied Purchase Agreement provides
that the Sellers are entitled to receive up to an additional 10.0 million (the Applied Earnout ), which is payable to the
Sellers in cash, upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to SMAT s collections from net sales of a collagen-based
product currently under development. Upon expiration of the seventh anniversary of the Closing, to the extent the Sellers have not earned
the entirety of the Applied Earnout, SMAT shall pay the Sellers a pro-rata amount of the Applied Earnout based on collections from net
sales of the product, with such amount to be due credited against any Applied Earnout payments already made by SMAT (the True-Up
Payment ). The Applied Earnout, minus the True-Up Payment and any Applied Earnout payments already made by SMAT, may be earned
at any point in the future, including after the True-Up Payment is made. 

In
connection with the Applied Asset Purchase and pursuant to the Applied Purchase Agreement, effective August 1, 2023, we entered into
a professional services agreement (the Petito Services Agreement with the Owner, pursuant to which the Owner, as an independent
contractor, agreed to provide certain services to us, including, among other things, assisting with the development of products already
in development and assisting with research, development, formulation, invention and manufacturing of any future products (the Petito

and (v) 1.0 million in cash in the event that a U.S. patent is issued for a certain product; provided that with respect to the incentive
payments described in (iv) and (v) of the foregoing, the Owner shall not earn more than 2.5 million. The Petito Services Agreement has
an initial term of three years and is subject to automatic successive one-month renewals unless earlier terminated in accordance with
its terms. The Petito Services Agreement may be terminated upon the Owner s death or disability or by us or the Owner For
Cause (as defined in the Petito Services Agreement); provided, however, that the base salary described in (i) of the foregoing

COMPONENTS
OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Sources
of Revenue 

Our
revenue is derived primarily from sales of our soft tissue repair and bone fusion products to hospitals and other acute care facilities.
In particular, the substantial majority of our product sales revenue is derived from sales of CellerateRX Surgical. Our revenue is driven
by direct orders shipped by us to our customers, and to a lesser extent, direct sales to customers through delivery at the time of procedure
by one of our sales representatives. We generally recognize revenue when a purchase order is received from the customer and our product
is received by the customer. 

Revenue
streams from product sales and royalties are summarized below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold consists primarily of the acquisition costs from the manufacturers of our licensed products, raw material costs for certain
components sourced directly by us, and all related royalties due as a result of the sale of our products. Our gross profit represents
total net revenue less the cost of goods sold, and gross margin represents gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. 

Operating
Expenses 

Selling,
general and administrative SG A expenses consist primarily of salaries, sales commissions, benefits, bonuses and
share-based compensation. SG A also includes outside legal counsel fees, audit fees, insurance premiums, rent and other corporate
expenses. We expense all SG A expenses as incurred. 

Research
and development R D expenses include costs related to enhancements to our currently available products and additional
investments in our product, services and technologies development pipeline. This includes personnel-related expenses, including salaries,
share-based compensation and benefits for all personnel directly engaged in R D activities, contracted services, materials, prototype
expenses and allocated overhead, which is comprised of compensation and benefits, lease expense and other facilities related costs. We
expense R D costs as incurred. We generally expect that R D expenses will increase as we continue to support product enhancements
and bring new products to market. 

Depreciation
and amortization expenses include depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets that have a finite life, such as
product licenses, patents and intellectual property, customer relationships and assembled workforces. 

Change
in fair value of earnout liabilities represents our measurement of the change in fair value at the balance sheet date of our earnout
liabilities that were established at the time of our Precision Healing merger and Scendia acquisition. 

40 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Other
income (expense) is primarily comprised of interest expense and other nonoperating activities.

Net
Revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated net revenue of 21.7 million compared to net revenue of
 16.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a 35 increase from the prior year period. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, we generated net revenue of 60.4 million compared to net revenue of 47.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, a 28 increase from the prior year period. The higher net revenue for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 was primarily due to increased sales of soft tissue repair products, particularly CellerateRX Surgical, as a result of our
increased market penetration and geographic expansion, and our continuing strategy to expand our independent distribution network in
both new and existing U.S. markets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, all of our net revenue was
generated from Sanara Surgical, as THP has not commercially launched. We plan to commercially launch the THP program in mid-2025. During the early part of the fourth quarter of 2024, we experienced a growth in sales of BIASURGE as a result of
supply chain issues and shortages of intravenous IV fluids and saline solutions due to Hurricane Helene. We expect
that sales of BIASURGE will normalize in upcoming quarters as the access to IV and saline solutions for the treatment of wound
irrigation is restored. 

Gross
Profit. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated gross profit of 19.7 million compared to gross profit of
 14.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a 38 increase from the prior year period. For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, we generated gross profit of 54.5 million compared to gross profit of 41.2 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, a 32 increase from the prior year period. The higher gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily
due to increased sales of soft tissue repair products, particularly CellerateRX Surgical, as a result of our increased market penetration
and geographic expansion, and our continuing strategy to expand our independent distribution network in both new and existing U.S. markets.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, all of our gross profit was generated from Sanara Surgical as THP has
not commercially launched. We plan to commercially launch the THP program in mid-2025. 

41 

Cost
of goods sold . Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.0 million compared to cost of goods sold
of 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 5.9
million, compared to costs of goods sold of 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margins were approximately
91 and 89 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 90 and 87 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The gross margins for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included higher margins
realized due to increased sales of soft tissue repair products, particularly CellerateRX Surgical, and the elimination of royalties paid
on the sales of CellerateRX Surgical as a result of the Applied Asset Purchase. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses . SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 19.0 million compared
to SG A expenses of 13.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. SG A expenses included 1.6 million and 0.4
million attributable to our THP segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. SG A expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 54.1 million compared to SG A expenses of 40.7 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. SG A expenses included 2.7 million and 1.4 million related to our THP segment for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The
higher SG A expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to the buildout of our THP platform and infrastructure which increased by
approximately 1.2 million and 1.3 million, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. In addition, SG A expenses were higher
due to higher direct sales and
marketing expenses, which accounted for approximately 3.7 million and 9.3 million, respectively, of the increases compared to the
prior year periods. The higher direct sales and marketing expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were
primarily attributable to an increase in sales commissions of 3.1 million and 6.9 million, respectively, as a result of higher
product sales. SG A expenses during the third quarter of 2024 also included 0.4 million of acquisition costs related to
prospective investments. SG A expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 1.0 million of executive
separation costs and 0.8 million of acquisition costs related to prospective investments. 

Research
and development expenses . R D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.4 million compared to R D
expenses of 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. R D expenses included 0.6 million and 0.8 million attributable
to our THP segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. R D expenses for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, were 3.3 million compared to 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. R D expenses included 1.3 million
and 2.8 million related to our THP segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The
higher R D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily
due to new projects associated with CellerateRX. The lower R D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to lower costs associated with the Precision Healing diagnostic imager and
LFA within the THP segment. 

Depreciation
and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.1 million
compared to depreciation and amortization expense of 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization
expense included 0.4 million attributable to our THP segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Depreciation and
amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.3 million compared to 2.6 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense included 1.2 million related to our THP segment for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

The
increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the
amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the Applied Asset Purchase. 

Change
in fair value of earnout liabilities. Change in fair value of earnout liabilities was 0.1 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024 compared to a benefit of 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Change in fair value of earnout liabilities
was 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a benefit of 1.5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

42 

The
benefit recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in the estimated fair value due to a change in the discount factor utilized in
the valuation models, a decrease in the projected undiscounted amounts to be paid, as well as adjustments to the projected timing of
the payments to be made, partially offset by accretion. 

Other
expense. Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.0 million compared to 0.2 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included interest expense, amortization
of debt issuance costs, paid-in-kind interest, and accretion of back-end fees related to the CRG Term Loan and loss from our equity method
investment in CMp of 31,448. Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.9 million compared to 0.2 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included interest expense, amortization of
debt issuance costs, paid-in-kind interest, and accretion of back-end fees related to the CRG Term Loan and interest expense, amortization
of debt issuance costs, the write-off of debt issuance costs related to the termination of the Cadence Term Loan and loss from our equity
method investment in CMp of 31,448. 

Net
loss . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 we had a net loss of 2.9 million compared to a net loss of 1.1 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net loss included 2.7 million and 1.7 million, attributable to our THP segment
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net
loss of 8.2 million, compared to a net loss of 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net loss included
 5.3 million and 5.4 million related to our THP segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
higher net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher SG A costs related to the buildout of our THP platform and infrastructure which increased
by approximately 1.2 million and 1.3 million, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. In addition, our net loss for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher due to higher interest expense as a result of our loan with CRG, an increase in expense
due to change in fair value of earnout liabilities, and higher amortization of our acquired intangible assets, partially offset by higher
gross profit. 

Segment
EBITDA . Segment EBITDA is the primary profitability measure used by the CODM for purposes of assessing financial
performance and resource allocation. We define Segment EBITDA for the reportable segments as net income (loss) excluding interest
expense/income, provision/benefit for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash share-based compensation expense, change
in fair value of earnout liabilities, share of losses from equity method investment, executive separation costs, legal and
diligence expenses related to acquisitions, and gains/losses on the disposal of property and equipment as each are applicable to
the periods presented. Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net
income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. We
believe Segment EBITDA is useful to investors because it facilitates comparisons of our core business operations across periods on a
consistent basis. Accordingly, we adjust for certain items, such as change in fair value of earnout liabilities, when calculating
Segment EBITDA because we believe that such items are not related to our core business operations. We do not, nor do we suggest that
investors should, consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Material limitations associated with the use of such measures include that they do not reflect all
costs included in operating expenses and may not be comparable with similarly named financial measures of other companies.
Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures are based on subjective determinations of management regarding the nature and
classification of events and circumstances. We present these non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with information to
evaluate our operating results in a manner similar to how management evaluates business performance. To compensate for any
limitations in such non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is useful in understanding and analyzing the results of
the business to review both GAAP information and the related non-GAAP financial measures.

Includes 328,795 of share-based compensation related to executive separation costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had Segment EBITDA of 0.8 million compared to 0.3 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. Our Segment EBITDA included 1.7) million and 1.1) million attributable to our THP segment for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Segment EBITDA was 1.7 million compared
to 0.3) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our Segment EBITDA included 3.4) million and 4.1) million related
to our THP segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The positive Segment EBITDA for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher amortization of our acquired intangible assets, higher interest expense,
executive separation costs and acquisition costs, as discussed above. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Cash
on hand at September 30, 2024 was 16.3 million, compared to 5.1 million at December 31, 2023. Historically, we have financed our operations
primarily from the sale of equity securities. In February 2023, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement
(the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Co., as sales agent Cantor ), pursuant to which we could
offer and sell from time to time, to or through Cantor, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 75.0
million. 

Sales
of the shares, pursuant to the Sales Agreement, were made in sales deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in
Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Upon delivery of a placement notice and subject to the terms
and conditions of the Sales Agreement, Cantor agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales
practices, applicable state and federal law, rules and regulations and the rules of The Nasdaq Capital Market to sell the shares from
time to time based upon our instructions, including any price, time period or size limits specified by us. We had no obligation to sell
any of the shares under the Sales Agreement and could suspend or terminate the offering of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement
upon notice to Cantor and subject to other conditions. Pursuant to the Sales Agreement, we paid Cantor a commission of 3.0 of the aggregate
gross proceeds from each sale of the shares. 

44 

In
2023, we sold an aggregate of 26,143 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately 1.1 million and net proceeds of approximately
 1.0 million pursuant to the Sales Agreement. We paused the offering at the end of the first quarter of 2023 and did not reactivate it
during the remainder of 2023. The Registration Statement on Form S-3 relating to this offering expired in January 2024. 

On
August 1, 2023, we, as guarantor, and SMAT, as borrower, entered into a loan agreement (the Cadence Loan Agreement with
Cadence Bank (the Bank providing for, among other things, a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of up to 12.0
million, which was evidenced by an advancing promissory note (the Cadence Term Loan ). Pursuant to the Cadence Loan Agreement,
the Bank agreed to make, at any time and from time to time prior to February 1, 2024, one or more advances to SMAT. On August 1, 2023,
the Bank made an advance under the Cadence Term Loan for 9.75 million, the proceeds of which were used to fund the Cash Closing Consideration
for the Applied Asset Purchase. For more information regarding the Cadence Loan Agreement, see the Cadence Loan Agreement 
section below. 

On
April 17, 2024, we entered into the CRG Term Loan Agreement by and among us, as borrower, the Guarantors, the Agent and the lenders party
thereto from time to time, providing for a senior secured term loan of up to 55.0 million. On the Closing Date,
the First Borrowing was made to repay the Cadence Term Loan and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the CRG Loan Agreement. The
remaining proceeds of 4.5 million were distributed to us. As a result, the Cadence Term Loan Agreement was terminated and all outstanding
amounts under the Cadence Term Loan were repaid in full and all security interest and other liens granted to or held by the Bank were
terminated and released. 

On
September 4, 2024, pursuant to our option under the CRG Term Loan Agreement, we borrowed an additional 15.5 million under the CRG
Term Loan Agreement. We used 5.0 million of the proceeds of the Second Borrowing for the investment in CMp. 

We expect to continue our investment in the THP strategy during the fourth quarter of 2025 through the expected commercial launch of THP
in mid-2025. Our continued investment over this period of time is currently estimated at 5.0 million to 10.0 million. We are pursuing
financial partners to invest in the execution of this strategy. 

We
expect our future needs for cash to include the funding of our additional investment in THP, potential acquisitions, further developing
our products, services and technologies pipeline and clinical studies, expanding our sales force, repayment of debt as it becomes due
and for general corporate purposes. If we seek to consummate acquisitions in the future, we expect to finance such acquisitions with
the proceeds from equity or debt issuances. Based on our current plan of operations, we believe our cash on hand, when combined with
expected cash flows from operations and available proceeds from the CRG Term Loan discussed herein, will be sufficient to fund our growth
strategy and to meet our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. 

Applied
Asset Purchase 

On
August 1, 2023, we entered into the Applied Purchase Agreement by and among the Company, SMAT, Hymed, Applied and the Owner, pursuant
to which SMAT acquired the Applied Purchased Assets and assumed certain Assumed Liabilities upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Applied Purchase Agreement. The transaction closed on August 1, 2023. The Applied Purchased Assets were purchased for
an initial aggregate purchase price of 15.25 million, consisting of (i) 9.75 million in cash, (ii) 73,809 shares of our common stock,
with an agreed upon value of 3.0 million and (iii) 2.5 million in cash, to be paid in four equal installments on each of the next four
anniversaries of the Closing. The first Installment Payment of 625,000 was made in August 2024. 

In
addition to the Cash Closing Consideration, Stock Closing Consideration and Installment Payments, the Applied Purchase Agreement provides
that the Sellers are entitled to receive up to an additional 10.0 million, which is payable to the Sellers in cash, upon the achievement
of certain performance thresholds relating to SMAT s collections from net sales of a collagen-based product currently under development.
Upon expiration of the seventh anniversary of the Closing, to the extent the Sellers have not earned the entirety of the Applied Earnout,
SMAT shall pay the Sellers the True-Up Payment. The Applied Earnout, minus the True-Up Payment and any Applied Earnout payments already
made by SMAT, may be earned at any point in the future, including after the True-Up Payment is made. 

45 

Cadence
Loan Agreement 

In
connection with the entry into the Applied Purchase Agreement, on August 1, 2023, we, as guarantor, and SMAT, as borrower, entered into
the Cadence Loan Agreement with the Bank providing for, among other things, a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 12.0 million,
which was evidenced by an advancing promissory note. Pursuant to the Cadence Loan Agreement, the Bank agreed to make, at any time and
from time to time prior to February 1, 2024, one or more advances to SMAT. 

The
proceeds of the advances under the Cadence Loan Agreement were to be used for working capital and for purposes of financing up to one
hundred percent (100 of the Cash Closing Consideration and Installment Payments for the Applied Asset Purchase and related fees and
expenses, including any subsequent payments that were due to the Sellers after the Closing. On August 1, 2023, the Bank, at the request
of SMAT, made an advance for 9.75 million. The proceeds from the advance were used to fund the Cash Closing Consideration for the Applied
Asset Purchase. 

The
unpaid principal balance of outstanding advances under the Cadence Term Loan bore interest, subject to certain conditions, at the lesser
of the Maximum Rate (as defined in the Cadence Loan Agreement) or the Base Rate, which was for any day, a rate per annum equal to the
term secured overnight financing rate (Term SOFR) (as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) for a one-month tenor in
effect on such day plus three percent (3.0 ). 

Pursuant
to the Cadence Loan Agreement, SMAT was required to maintain a minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio and a Cash Flow Leverage Ratio. 

As
noted above, on the Closing Date the Cadence Loan Agreement was terminated and all outstanding amounts under the Cadence Term Loan were
repaid in full and all security interest and other liens granted to or held by the Bank were terminated and released. The aggregate principal
amount of the Cadence Term Loan outstanding under the Cadence Loan Agreement was 9.8 million at the time of termination, and the Cadence
Term Loan bore interest at a per annum rate equal to the term secured overnight financing rate (Term SOFR) (as administered by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York) for a one-month tenor in effect on such day plus three percent (3.0 ). At the time of termination, we also
paid the Bank approximately 27.1 thousand, which consisted of interest accrued or deemed payable under the Cadence Loan Agreement. We
did not pay an exit fee or prepayment fee in connection with our voluntary repayment of the Cadence Term Loan. 

CRG
Term Loan Agreement 

On
April 17, 2024, we, as borrower, entered into the CRG Term Loan Agreement with the Guarantors, the Agent, and the lenders party thereto
from time to time, providing for a senior secured term loan of up to 55.0 million. The CRG Term Loan Agreement provides for (i) 15.0
million of the CRG Term Loan that was borrowed on the Closing Date and (ii) up to an aggregate of 40.0 million available for borrowing
in two subsequent borrowings, provided that each such borrowing must be at least 5.0 million or a multiple of 5.0 million and
occur between the Closing Date and June 30, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including that the First Borrowing
having previously occurred and the Agent having received certain fees. 

On
September 4, 2024, pursuant to our option under the CRG Term Loan Agreement, we borrowed an additional 15.5 million under the CRG Term
Loan Agreement. 

The
First Borrowing, Second Borrowing and any additional borrowings under the CRG Term Loan are due and payable on March 30, 2029 (the Maturity
Date ), absent any acceleration. Pursuant to the CRG Term Loan Agreement, a portion of the proceeds from the First Borrowing of
the CRG Term Loan was used to repay the Cadence Term Loan and to pay fees and expenses related to the CRG Term Loan Agreement. We used
 5.0 million of the proceeds of the Second Borrowing for the investment in CMp, and we intend to use the remaining proceeds for permitted
acquisition opportunities and for general working capital and corporate purposes. 

The
CRG Term Loan bears interest at a per annum rate equal to 13.25 (subject to a 4.0 increase during an event of default), of which 8.00 
must be paid in cash and 5.25 may, at our election, be deferred through the 19 th quarterly Payment Date (defined below) by
adding such amount to the aggregate principal loan amount, so long as no default or event of default under the CRG Term Loan Agreement
has occurred and is continuing. We are required to make quarterly interest payments on the final business day of each calendar quarter
following the Closing Date, commencing on the first such date to occur at least 30 days after the Closing Date (each, a Payment
Date ). Interest is payable on each Payment Date in arrears with respect to the time between each Payment Date and upon the payment
or prepayment of the CRG Term Loan, ending on the Maturity Date. In addition, we are required to pay an upfront fee of 1.50 of the principal
amount of the CRG Term Loan, which is payable as amounts are advanced under the CRG Term Loan on a pro rata basis. We are also required
to pay a back-end fee equal to 7.00 of the aggregate principal amount advanced under the CRG Term Loan Agreement. We paid upfront fees
of 225,000 on the Closing Date related to the First Borrowing and 232,500 of upfront fees on September 4, 2024 related to the Second
Borrowing. As of September 30, 2024, there was 30.5 million of principal outstanding and 24.5 million available for future borrowing
under the CRG Term Loan. 

46 

Subject
to certain exceptions, we are required to make mandatory prepayments of the CRG Term Loan with the proceeds of certain assets sales and
in the event of a change of control of the Company. In addition, we may make a voluntary prepayment of the CRG Term Loan, in whole or
in part, at any time. All mandatory and voluntary prepayments of the CRG Term Loan are subject to the payment of prepayment premiums
as follows: (i) if prepayment occurs on or prior to the date that is one year following the applicable borrowing (the Borrowing
Date ), an amount equal to 10.0 of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loan being prepaid and (ii) if prepayment
occurs one year after the applicable Borrowing Date and on or prior to two years following the applicable Borrowing Date, an amount equal
to 5.0 of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the CRG Term Loan being prepaid. No prepayment premium is due on any principal
prepaid if prepayment occurs two years or more after the applicable Borrowing Date. 

Certain
of our current and future subsidiaries, including the Guarantors, are guaranteeing our obligations under the CRG Term Loan Agreement.
As security for our obligations under the CRG Term Loan Agreement, on the Closing Date, we and the Guarantors entered into a security
agreement with the Agent pursuant to which we and the Guarantors granted to the Agent, as collateral agent for the lenders, a lien on
substantially all of our and the Guarantors assets, including intellectual property (subject to certain exceptions). 

The
CRG Term Loan Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type, including limitations on our
and the Guarantors abilities, among other things, to incur additional debt, grant or permit additional liens, make investments
and acquisitions above certain thresholds, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of assets, pay dividends and distributions and enter
into affiliate transactions, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the CRG Term Loan Agreement contains the following
financial covenants requiring us and the Guarantors in the aggregate to maintain: 

liquidity
 in an amount which shall exceed the greater of (i) 3.0 million and (ii) to the extent we have incurred certain permitted debt, the
 minimum cash balance, if any, required of us by the creditors of such permitted debt; and 

annual
minimum revenue: (i) for the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2024, of at least 60.0 million,
(ii) for the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 2025 and ending on December 31, 2025, of at least 75.0 million, (iii) for the
twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 2026 and ending on December 31, 2026, of at least 85.0 million, (iv) for the twelve-month
period beginning on January 1, 2027 and ending on December 31, 2027, of at least 95.0 million and (v) during each twelve-month period
beginning on January 1 of a given year thereafter, of at least 105.0 million. 

Cash
Flow Analysis 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 1.0 million compared to 2.4 million used in operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The lower use of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to
net revenue growth outpacing the growth of our cash operating expenses and the timing of cash expenditures for certain accrued payables
and prepaids. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 6.5 million compared to 10.2 million used in
investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The lower use of cash used in investing activities during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to cash used for the investment in CMp of 5.0 million plus transaction expenses of
 0.3 million and the advancement of a convertible loan of 1.1 million compared to 9.9 million used for the Applied Asset
Purchase. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 18.6 million compared to 9.8 million provided
by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash provided by financing activities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 was due to the receipt of proceeds from the CRG Term Loan, which were partially offset by the payoff
of the Cadence Term Loan.

MATERIAL
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES 

CellerateRX
Surgical Sublicense Agreement 

We
have an exclusive, world-wide sublicense to distribute CellerateRX Surgical products into the surgical and wound care markets from an
affiliate of Catalyst, CGI Cellerate RX, which, prior to the Applied Asset Purchase, licensed the rights to CellerateRX from Applied.
Sales of CellerateRX Surgical comprised the substantial majority of our sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.
Prior to the Applied Asset Purchase discussed above, we paid royalties based on the annual Net Sales of licensed products (as defined
in the Sublicense Agreement) consisting of 3 of all collected Net Sales each year up to 12.0 million, 4 of all collected Net Sales
each year that exceed 12.0 million up to 20.0 million, and 5 of all collected Net Sales each year that exceed 20.0 million. Ronald
T. Nixon, our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman, is the founder and managing partner of Catalyst. 

In
August 2023, we acquired the underlying intellectual property of, as well as the rights to manufacture and sell, certain hydrolyzed
collagen products, including CellerateRX Surgical, from Applied. In connection with this acquisition, Applied assigned the License Agreement
with CGI Cellerate RX to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, SMAT, and no further royalties will be due to Applied thereunder.
On October 10, 2024, the License Agreement and the Sublicense Agreement were terminated. 

Consulting
Agreement 

In
July 2021, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Rochal, a related party. Concurrent with the Rochal asset purchase, we entered

In consideration for the consulting services to be provided to us, Ms. Salamone is entitled to receive an annual consulting fee of 177,697,
with payments to be paid once per month. The consulting agreement has an initial term of three years, unless earlier terminated by us,
and is subject to renewal. Effective July 13, 2024, the consulting agreement with Ms. Salamone was amended to provide that the initial
term shall be automatically renewed for successive one-year terms for up to three successive years unless earlier terminated by either
party without cause at any time, provided that the terminating party provides 90 days advance written notice of termination. Ms.
Salamone is a director of the Company, is a significant shareholder and the current chair of the board of directors of Rochal. 

Catalyst
Transaction Advisory Services Agreement 

In
March 2023, we entered into a Transaction Advisory Services Agreement (the Catalyst Services Agreement effective March
1, 2023 with Catalyst, a related party. Pursuant to the Catalyst Services Agreement, Catalyst, by and through its directors, officers,
employees and affiliates that are not simultaneously serving as directors, officers or employees of the Company (collectively, the Covered
Persons ), agreed to perform certain transaction advisory, business and organizational strategy, finance, marketing, operational

divestiture, financing, refinancing, or other similar transaction in which we may be, or may consider becoming, involved, and any such
additional services as mutually agreed upon in writing by and between Catalyst and us (the Catalyst Services ). 

Pursuant
to the Catalyst Services Agreement, we agreed to reimburse Catalyst for (i) compensation actually paid by Catalyst to any of the Covered

as documented in reasonably sufficient detail, and (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses payable to unaffiliated third
parties, as documented in customary expense reports, as each of (i) and (ii) is incurred in connection with the Catalyst Services rendered
under the Catalyst Services Agreement, with all reimbursements being contingent upon the prior approval of the Audit Committee of our
Board of Directors. We incurred costs relating to the Catalyst Services Agreement of 49,829 and 44,032 during the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 163,101 and 117,018 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

IMPACT
OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES 

Inflation
and changing prices have not had a material impact on our historical results of operations. We do not currently anticipate that inflation
and changing prices will have a material impact on our future results of operations. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
actual results may differ from the estimates on which our financial statements are prepared at any given point of time. Changes in these
estimates could materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Significant items that are
subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue and expense accruals, the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities
and the allocation of purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired. Our critical accounting estimates have not significantly changed
since December 31, 2023 and are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Our
indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. 

 A
significant portion of our future cash flow is required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and we may be
unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have future borrowings available, to enable us to repay our indebtedness
or to fund other liquidity needs. Among other consequences, this indebtedness could: 

require
 us to use a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations for debt service and
 the satisfaction of repayment obligations, and not for other purposes, such as funding working
 capital and capital expenditures or making future acquisitions; 

limit
 our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and limit our ability
 to exploit future business opportunities; and 

cause
 us to be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive
 disadvantage. 

Our
outstanding indebtedness is subject to certain operating and financial covenants that restrict our business and financing activities
and may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business . 

The
CRG Term Loan Agreement requires us, as borrower, and the Guarantors to maintain compliance with certain operating and financial covenants,
which provide that we and the Guarantors, among other things, may not, subject to certain exceptions: 

create,
 incur, assume or permit to exist any indebtedness, whether directly or indirectly; 

create,
 incur, assume or permit the existence of additional liens on our property or assets, or assign
 or sell any income or revenues (including accounts receivable) or rights in respect of any
 thereof; 

enter
 into any transaction of merger, amalgamation or consolidation or liquidate, wind up or dissolve
 itself (or suffer any liquidation or dissolution), or make certain acquisitions; 

engage
 to any material extent in any business other than the business engaged in on the date of
 closing or a business that constitutes a reasonable extension or expansion thereof; 

make,
 directly or indirectly, or permit to remain outstanding any investments; 

declare
 or make, or agree to pay or make, directly or indirectly, any restricted payments as described
 in the CRG Term Loan Agreement; 

make
 any payments in respect of any subordinated debt or certain other indebtedness incurred pursuant
 to the CRG Term Loan Agreement; 

sell,
 lease, license, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any of its property to any person in one
 transaction or series of transactions; 

50 

sell,
 lease, license or otherwise transfer any assets to, or purchase, lease, license or otherwise
 acquire any assets from, or otherwise engage in any other transactions with, any of its affiliates; 

directly
 or indirectly, enter into, incur or permit to exist any restrictive agreement; 

enter
 into any amendment to or modification of its organizational documents in a manner that would
 be materially adverse to the interests, or rights or remedies, of the Agent and the lenders; 

engage
 in sale-leasebacks; 

make
 any significant change in accounting treatment or reporting practices, except as required
 or permitted by GAAP; 

dispose
 of, whether by sale, contribution, investment or otherwise, any material intellectual property
 to any Guarantor that is not an obligor or to any joint venture; or 

contribute
 or otherwise invest any material intellectual property in any Guarantor that is not an obligor
 or to any joint venture. 

In
addition, the CRG Term Loan Agreement requires us and the Guarantors in the aggregate to maintain: 

liquidity
 in an amount which shall exceed the greater of (i) 3.0 million and (ii) to the extent we
 have incurred certain permitted debt, the minimum cash balance, if any, required of us by
 the creditors of such permitted debt; and 

annual
 minimum revenue: (i) for the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 2024 and ending
 on December 31, 2024, of at least 60.0 million, (ii) for the twelve-month period beginning
 on January 1, 2025 and ending on December 31, 2025, of at least 75.0 million, (iii) for
 the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 2026 and ending on December 31, 2026, of
 at least 85.0 million, (iv) for the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 2027 and
 ending on December 31, 2027, of at least 95.0 million and (v) during each twelve-month period
 beginning on January 1 of a given year thereafter, of at least 105.0 million. 

A
breach of any of the covenants under our loan agreements, subject to certain cure periods, will result in an event of default, which
could cause all of our outstanding indebtedness under the CRG Term Loan Agreement to become immediately due and payable, and a default
interest rate of up to an additional 4.0 per annum may be applied to the outstanding loan balance. If our indebtedness is accelerated,
we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability
to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.
