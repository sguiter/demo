 Unless otherwise indicated, information in this report is presented in USD and comparisons are to comparable prior year periods. Our primary operating currencies, other than the USD, include the CAD, the GBP and our Central European operating currencies such as the EUR, CZK, RON and RSD. 
 These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report and have been prepared on a consistent basis with the accounting policies described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report, except as noted in Note 2, "New Accounting Pronouncements" . 
 The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year or any other future period. 
 Anti-Dilutive Securities 
 Anti-dilutive securities from share-based awards excluded from the computation of diluted EPS were million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Dividends

This repurchase program replaces and supersedes any repurchase program previously approved by our Board.

 million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. In addition, we had non-cash activities related to certain issuances of share-based awards. 
 Other than the activity mentioned above and the supplemental non-cash activity related to the recognition of leases further discussed in Note 6, "Leases " there was no other significant non-cash activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 The allowance for doubtful accounts for trade receivables was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Supplier Financing 
 We are the buyer under a supplier finance program with Citibank N.A. with million and million confirmed as valid and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We recognize these unpaid balances in accounts payable and other current liabilities on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Acquisition 
 On August 7, 2023, we acquired a equity interest in Blue Run Spirits, Inc., a U.S. based high end whiskey business, for a purchase price of million, which included cash paid of million. The acquisition is aligned with our strategy to expand beyond the beer aisle and enhance our presence in the spirits category. 
 The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, with million allocated to a definite-lived brand intangible asset to be amortized over a -year period and the remainder primarily allocated to other working capital balances and goodwill for the amount in excess of the net identifiable assets acquired. An NCI was recognized at fair value based on a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recorded as redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets based on the contractual terms of the agreement. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented as the impact is not material to our results of operation or financial position. 
 Purchases of Annuity Contracts 
 On September 26, 2024, we purchased annuity contracts for of our Canadian pension plans which transferred approximately million of pension plan liabilities, along with the associated administration of benefits, to an insurance company using the plan's respective pension plan assets. This transaction had no impact on the amount, timing or form of the retirement benefit payments to the affected retirees and beneficiaries. As a result of the transaction, we reduced the respective pension plan liabilities and assets and remeasured any remaining pension plan liabilities and assets using updated actuarial assumptions. We elected the practical expedient to perform the remeasurement as of the nearest calendar month-end date, which was September 30, 2024. A total settlement loss of million was recorded to other pension and postretirement benefit (costs), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations during the third quarter of 2024. See the impacts of the pension plan remeasurement and settlement on AOCI in Note 11, "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)."

 ownership interest. Since the exercise was irrevocable, the NCI became mandatorily redeemable at that time and should have been reclassified to accounts payable and other current liabilities. These errors resulted in a reclassification of million from noncontrolling interests, of which million was reclassified to accounts payable and other current liabilities for CBPL and million was reclassified to redeemable noncontrolling interests for the other immaterial investments in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the errors resulted in a cumulative understatement of million to net income attributable to NCI and a corresponding cumulative overstatement to net income attributable to MCBC in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The errors were corrected through an out of period adjustment as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Management assessed the impact of the errors and deemed them to not be material to any prior periods or to forecasted results for 2024. In October 2024, we obtained a final redemption value that would be due to acquire the NCI of the CBPL partnership. As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an adjustment of million to increase the mandatorily redeemable NCI liability to the final redemption value, with the adjustment recorded to interest expense. 
 Subsequent Events 
 The CBPL buyout was finalized on October 21, 2024, resulting in a cash payment of million which will be recorded as a cash outflow from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2024.

 ownership interest. In October 2024, we obtained a final valuation of the redemption value that would be due to acquire the remaining . The transaction was finalized on October 21, 2024, resulting in a cash payment of million. See further discussion of this transaction in Note 1, "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." 
 Both BRI and BDL have outstanding third party debt which is guaranteed by their respective shareholders. As a result, we had a guarantee liability of million and million recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is presented within accounts payable and other current liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and represents our proportionate share of the outstanding balance of these debt instruments. The offset to the guarantee liability was recorded as an adjustment to our respective equity method investment on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The resulting change in our equity method investments during the year due to movements in the guarantee represents a non-cash investing activity. 
 ZOA Energy, LLC 
 During the third quarter of 2023, we increased our investment in ZOA Energy, LLC ("ZOA"), an energy drink company operating in the U.S. and Canada, bringing our ownership interest to , on a fully diluted basis. The increase in ownership resulted in the transition of accounting for our investment from the fair value method under ASC 321 to equity method investment accounting under ASC 323 on a prospective basis and the cash outflow associated with the investment is reflected within other in the investing activities section of the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. Subsequent to the investment, the carrying value of our recorded ownership investment exceeds our ratable portion of underlying equity in the net assets of ZOA, and this basis difference has been fully allocated to equity method goodwill. 
 In October 2024, we increased our investment in ZOA for cash consideration of million, bringing our ownership interest to subsequent to the closing of the transaction. The transaction will be recorded as a business combination, and ZOA will be included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition within the Americas reporting segment. The acquisition is aligned with our strategy to expand beyond beer. Based on the timing of the transaction, we are still in the preliminary stages of accounting for this transaction and expect to complete our preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as other consolidation adjustments during the fourth quarter of 2024.

 As of the date of our annual impairment test performed as of October 1, 2023, the fair value of the Americas reporting unit goodwill balance was in excess of its carrying value by slightly less than , and as such, the reporting unit continues to be at heightened risk of future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in assumptions. We continue to focus on growing our core power brands net sales, aggressively premiumizing our portfolio and scaling and expanding beyond beer. While progress has been made on these strategies over recent years, including the strengthening of our core power brands, the growth targets included in management s forecasted future cash flows are inherently at risk given that the strategies are still in progress. Additionally, the fair value determinations are sensitive to changes in the beer industry environment, broader macroeconomic conditions and market multiples or discount rates that could negatively impact future analyses, including the impacts of cost inflation, increases to interest rates and other external industry factors impacting our business.

 As of the date of our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets, performed as of October 1, 2023, the carrying value of the Staropramen family of brands in EMEA APAC was determined to be in excess of its fair value such that an impairment loss was recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2023. As this was a partial impairment, the intangible asset is considered to be at a heightened risk of future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in assumptions, including forecasted future cash flows based on execution of strategic initiatives for expansion and distribution of the brand, as well as discount rates and other macroeconomic factors. Our indefinite-lived intangible asset annual impairment analysis as of October 1, 2024 is currently in progress, and we have not yet finalized our results. 
 The fair value of the Coors brands in the Americas, the Miller brands in the U.S. and the Carling brands in EMEA APAC all exceeded their respective carrying values by over as of the October 1, 2023 annual testing date. 
 No triggering events were identified during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that would indicate the carrying values of our indefinite-lived or definite-lived intangible assets were greater than their fair values.

Total debt discounts and debt issuance costs capitalized in connection with these senior notes, including underwriting fees, were approximately million, and are being amortized over the term of the EUR 2032 Senior Notes. The EUR 2032 Senior Notes began accruing interest upon issuance, with interest payments due annually. Additionally, upon issuance we designated the EUR 2032 Senior Notes as a hedge of our investment in a EUR functional currency subsidiary.

 Debt Fair Value Measurements 
 We utilize market approaches to estimate the fair value of certain outstanding borrowings by discounting anticipated future cash flows derived from the contractual terms of the obligations using observable market interest and foreign exchange rates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our outstanding long-term debt (including the current portion of long-term debt) was approximately billion and billion, respectively. All senior notes are valued based on significant observable inputs and classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of all other outstanding long-term borrowings and our short-term borrowings approximate their fair values and are also classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper 
 On June 3, 2024, we amended our existing billion multi-currency revolving credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date from June 26, 2028 to June 26, 2029. The amendment did not change the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility, which allows us to issue a maximum aggregate amount of billion in commercial paper or other borrowings at any time at variable interest rates. Similarly, the million sub-facility available for the issuance of letters of credit remains unchanged. We use this facility from time to time to leverage cash needs to fund the repayment of debt upon maturity and for working capital or general purposes. 
 We had borrowings drawn on the amended and restated multi-currency revolving credit facility and commercial paper borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Debt Covenants 
 Under the terms of each of our debt facilities, we must comply with certain restrictions. These include customary events of default and specified representations, warranties and covenants, as well as covenants that restrict our ability to incur certain additional priority indebtedness (certain thresholds of secured consolidated net tangible assets), certain leverage threshold percentages, create or permit liens on assets, and restrictions on mergers, acquisitions and certain types of sale lease-back transactions.

The accumulated gains and losses associated with the settled net investment hedge will remain in AOCI until a liquidation or deconsolidation event at which point the accumulated gains and losses will be reclassified into earnings. 
 Foreign Currency Forwards 
 In the second quarter of 2023, we entered into approximately CAD million (approximately million USD) of foreign exchange forward contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations related to the repayment of our CAD million senior notes that matured on July 15, 2023. These contracts were not designated in hedge accounting relationships and, as such, changes in the fair value were recorded in other non-operating income (expense), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. These contracts settled on July 12, 2023 for an immaterial amount in advance of the senior notes being repaid. 
 Derivative Fair Value Measurements 
 We utilize market approaches to estimate the fair value of our derivative instruments by discounting anticipated future cash flows derived from the derivative's contractual terms and observable market interest, foreign exchange and commodity rates. The fair values of our derivatives also include credit risk adjustments to account for our counterparties' credit risk, as well as our own non-performance risk, as appropriate.

 million valuation allowance was recorded for the year to date period. The higher effective tax rate was also due to the million increase in the mandatorily redeemable NCI liability of CBPL to the final redemption value, which was recorded to interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 and is non-deductible for tax purposes. Finally, the higher effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was partly driven by a decrease in discrete tax benefit. 
 Our effective tax rate can be volatile and may change with, among other things, the amount and source of pretax income or loss, our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based compensation, changes in tax laws and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions as statutes of limitations expire, positions are effectively settled, or when additional information becomes available. There are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions and other changes to regulatory environments in countries in which we do business that, if enacted, could have an impact on our effective tax rate. 
 Recently, intergovernmental entities such as the Organization for Economic Development ("OECD") and European Union ("EU") have proposed changes to the existing tax laws of member countries, including model rules introduced by the OECD for a new 15 global minimum tax. In December 2022, the EU member states agreed to incorporate the 15 global minimum tax into their respective domestic laws effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023. In addition, several non-EU countries, including Canada and the U.K., have proposed and/or adopted legislation consistent with the OECD global minimum tax framework. The global minimum tax, which is now effective in countries with enacted legislation, did not materially impact our financial or cash tax position in the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024. We continue to evaluate the impact on future periods as previously-enacting countries issue related guidance and additional countries consider adoption of the global minimum tax rules.

While we cannot predict the eventual aggregate cost for litigation, other disputes and environmental matters in which we are currently involved, we believe adequate reserves have been provided for losses that are probable and estimable. For all matters unless otherwise noted below, we believe that any reasonably possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued are immaterial to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Our litigation, other disputes and environmental issues are discussed in further detail within Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements, Note 13, "Commitments and Contingencies" in our Annual Report and did not significantly change during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other than those disclosed below, we are also involved in other disputes and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in our opinion, based on a review with legal counsel, other than as noted, none of these disputes or legal actions are expected to have a material impact on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these, or other matters, may arise from time to time that may harm our business. 
 On February 12, 2018, Stone Brewing Company filed a trademark infringement lawsuit in federal court in the Southern District of California against Molson Coors Beverage Company USA LLC ("MCBC USA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of our Company, alleging that the Keystone brand had "rebranded" itself as "Stone" and was marketing itself in a manner confusingly similar to Stone Brewing Company's registered Stone trademark. In the first quarter of 2022, a jury returned a verdict in which it concluded that trademark infringement had occurred and awarded Stone Brewing Company million in damages. After denial of post-trial motions, in the fourth quarter of 2023, MCBC USA filed a notice of appeal in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is scheduled to be heard in November 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a recorded accrued liability of million and million, respectively, within other liabilities on our u naudited condensed consolidated balance sheets reflecting the best estimate of probable loss in this case based on the judgment plus associated post-judgment interest. However, it is reasonably possible that the estimate of the loss could change in the near term based on the progression of the case, including the appeals process. We will continue to monitor the status of the case and will adjust the accrual in the period in which any significant change occurs which could impact the estimate of the loss for this matter.

 Purchases of Annuity Contracts 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased annuity contracts for two of our Canadian pension plans. As a result, on September 30, 2024, we remeasured both pension plans and recorded the offset to AOCI in addition to recording a total settlement loss of 34.0 million. See Part I. Item 1.

 Cobra Beer Partnership, Ltd. Buyout 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we adjusted our NCI by 34.5 million to our best estimate of the redemption value that existed at the time of the put option exercise in March 2024 by increasing our net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and decreasing our net income attributable to MCBC. In addition, the final determination of the redemption value was received in October 2024, and we recorded an adjustment of 45.8 million to interest expense in the EMEA APAC segment with the offset to the mandatorily redeemable NCI that was recorded to accounts payable and other current liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. See further discussion of this transaction in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 1, "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" .

We recognized a loss of 41.1 million related to the disposal of the sold businesses. We expect to continue to incur incremental restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 through completion of wind down and closure of certain remaining U.S. craft facilities. Remaining charges are estimated to total approximately 95 million to 115 million, consisting primarily of accelerated depreciation charges. See Part I. Item 1.

 Net sales - Favorable impact of 1.6 million (favorable impact for EMEA APAC of 15.1 million, partially offset by the unfavorable impact for Americas 13.5 million). 
 Cost of goods sold - Unfavorable impact of 1.7 million (unfavorable impact for EMEA APAC of 10.4 million, partially offset by the favorable impact for Americas and Unallocated of 8.3 million and 0.4 million, respectively). 
 MG A - Unfavorable impact of 0.7 million (unfavorable impact for EMEA APAC of 3.8 million, partially offset by the favorable impact for Americas of 3.1 million). 
 Income (loss) before income taxes - Unfavorable impact of 5.1 million (unfavorable impact for Americas and EMEA APAC of 3.9 million and 2.8 million, respectively, partially offset by the favorable impact for Unallocated of 1.6 million). 
 The impacts of foreign currency movements on our consolidated USD results described above for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to the weakening of the USD compared to the GBP, partially offset by the strengthening of the USD compared to the CAD and CZK. 
 Included in these amounts are both translational and transactional impacts of changes in foreign exchange rates. We calculate the impact of foreign exchange by translating our current period local currency results at the average exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior year period during the respective period throughout the year and comparing that amount with the reported amount for the period. The impact of transactional foreign currency gains and losses, including the impact of undesignated foreign currency forwards, is recorded within other non-operating income (expense), net in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Volume 
 Financial volume represents owned or actively managed brands sold to unrelated external customers within our geographic markets (net of returns and allowances), as well as contract brewing, wholesale/factored non-owned volume and company-owned distribution volume. This metric is presented on an STW basis to reflect the sales from our operations to our direct customers, generally distributors. We believe this metric is important and useful for investors and management because it gives an indication of the amount of beer and adjacent products that we have produced and shipped to customers. This metric excludes royalty volume, which consists of our brands produced and sold under various license and contract brewing agreements. Factored volume in our EMEA APAC segment is the distribution of beer, wine, spirits and other products owned and produced by other companies to the on-premise channel, which is a common arrangement in the U.K. 
 Net Sales 
 The following table highlights the drivers of the change in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 (in percentages): 
 Financial Volume Price and Sales Mix Currency Total Consolidated net sales (12.3) 4.5 (7.8) 
 Net sales decreased 7.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to prior year, driven by lower financial volumes, partially offset by favorable price and sales mix. 
 Financial volumes decreased 12.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to lower shipments, including lower contract brewing volumes in the Americas. 
 Price and sales mix favorably impacted net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 by 4.5 , primarily due to increased net pricing as well as favorable sales mix for both segments, including as a result of lower contract brewing volumes in the U.S.

 Cost of goods sold 
 We utilize cost of goods sold per hectoliter, as well as the year over year changes in this metric, as a key metric for analyzing our results. This metric is calculated as cost of goods sold per our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations divided by financial volume for the respective period. We believe this metric is important and useful for investors and management because it provides an indication of the trends of sales mix and other cost impacts on our cost of goods sold. 
 Cost of goods sold decreased 5.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to lower financial volumes, partially offset by higher cost of goods sold per hectoliter. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 7.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to volume deleverage in the Americas segment, unfavorable mix driven by lower contract brewing volumes in the Americas segment, unfavorable changes in our unrealized mark-to-market commodity derivative positions of 34.4 million and cost inflation related to materials and manufacturing expenses, partially offset by cost savings initiatives. 
 Cost of goods sold decreased 3.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to lower financial volumes, partially offset by higher cost of goods sold per hectoliter. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 1.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to cost inflation related to materials and manufacturing expenses, unfavorable mix driven by lower contract brewing volumes in the Americas segment and volume deleverage, partially offset by favorable changes in our unrealized commodity mark-to-market derivative positions of 109.7 million and cost savings initiatives. 
 A discussion of currency impacts on cost of goods sold is included in the "Foreign currency impacts on results" section above. 
 Marketing, general and administrative expenses 
 MG A expenses decreased 8.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to prior year, primarily due to lower marketing investment resulting from cycling higher spend levels in the prior year and lower incentive compensation expense. 
 MG A expenses decreased 1.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to prior year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense, partially offset by increased marketing investment to support our brands and innovations. 
 A discussion of currency impacts on MG A expenses is included in the "Foreign currency impacts on results" section above. 
 Other operating income (expense), net 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we made the decision to wind down or sell certain of our U.S. craft businesses and related facilities and recorded employee-related and asset abandonment charges, including accelerated depreciation in excess of normal depreciation. We recognized a loss of 41.1 million related to the disposal of the sold businesses. See Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 12, "Other Operating Income (Expense), net" for detail of our other operating income (expense), net.

 Total non-operating income (expense), net 
 Total non-operating expense, net increased 148.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense driven by a 45.8 million adjustment to increase our mandatorily redeemable NCI liability to the final redemption value related to the CBPL buyout and a settlement loss of 34.0 million recorded as a result of Canadian pension plan annuity purchases. 
 Total non-operating expense, net increased 37.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense driven by a 45.8 million adjustment to increase our mandatorily redeemable NCI liability to the final redemption value related to the CBPL buyout and a settlement loss of 34.0 million recorded as a result of Canadian pension plan annuity purchases in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by higher interest income from higher cash balances and higher pension and OPEB non-service benefit. 
 Income tax benefit (expense) 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Effective tax rate 31 21 25 22 
 The higher effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year, was partly due to the impact of a valuation allowance that was recorded on deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2024 related to the divestment of certain of our U.S. craft businesses. The divestment resulted in the realization of a capital loss for U.S. tax purposes. We believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset generated by the capital loss will not be recognized, and as a result, a 16.4 million valuation allowance was recorded for the year to date period. The higher effective tax rate was also due to the 45.8 million increase in the mandatorily redeemable NCI liability of CBPL to the final redemption value, which was recorded to interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 and is non-deductible for tax purposes. Finally, the higher effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was partly driven by a decrease in discrete tax benefit. 
 Our effective tax rate can be volatile and may change with, among other things, the amount and source of pretax income or loss, our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based compensation, changes in tax laws and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions as statutes of limitations expire, positions are effectively settled or when additional information becomes available. There are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions and other changes to regulatory environments in countries in which we do business that, if enacted, could have an impact on our effective tax rate. 
 Refer to Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 9, "Income Tax" for discussion regarding our effective tax rate. 
 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 28.1 million and 24.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the recording of an out of period adjustment to increase the noncontrolling interest to the best estimate of the redemption value that existed at the time of the put option exercise in March 2024. See further discussion in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 1, "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" .

 Income (loss) before income taxes 
 Income before income taxes declined 26.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to prior year, primarily due to lower financial volumes, higher other operating expense as a result of the exit of our U.S. craft businesses and related restructuring costs and cost inflation related to materials and manufacturing expenses, partially offset by lower MG A expense, increased net pricing, favorable sales mix and cost savings initiatives. Lower MG A expense was primarily driven by lower marketing spend resulting from the cycling of higher spend levels in the prior year and lower incentive compensation expense. 
 Income before income taxes declined 3.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to prior year, primarily due to lower financial volumes, cost inflation related to materials and manufacturing expenses, higher other operating expense as a result of the exit of our U.S. craft businesses and related restructuring costs, partially offset by increased net pricing, lower MG A expense, favorable sales mix and cost savings initiatives.

 Unallocated Segment 
 We have certain activity that is not allocated to our segments, which has been reflected as "Unallocated" below. Specifically, Unallocated primarily includes certain financing-related activities such as interest expense and interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances and realized and unrealized changes in fair value on instruments not designated in hedging relationships related to financing and other treasury-related activities. Unallocated activity also includes the unrealized changes in fair value on our commodity swaps not designated in hedging relationships recorded within cost of goods sold, which are later reclassified when realized to the segment in which the underlying exposure resides. Only the service cost component of net periodic pension and OPEB cost is reported within each operating segment, and all other components remain unallocated.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Overview 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include cash provided by operating activities and access to external capital. We continue to monitor world events which may create credit or economic challenges that could adversely impact our profit or operating cash flows and our ability to obtain additional liquidity. We currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and cash provided by short-term and long-term borrowings, when necessary, will be adequate to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, capital expenditures and other obligations for the twelve months subsequent to the date of the issuance of this quarterly report and our long-term liquidity requirements. We do not have any restrictions that prevent or limit our ability to declare or pay dividends. 
 While a significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities are generated within the U.S., our cash balances include cash held outside the U.S. and in currencies other than the USD. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 58 of our cash and cash equivalents were located outside the U.S., largely denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and may continue to have a material impact on these foreign cash balances. Cash balances in foreign countries are often subject to additional restrictions. We may, therefore, have difficulties timely repatriating cash held outside the U.S., and such repatriation may be subject to tax. These limitations may affect our ability to fully utilize our cash resources for needs in the U.S. and other countries and may adversely affect our liquidity. To the extent necessary, we accrue for tax consequences on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as they are earned. We may utilize tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. We periodically review and evaluate these plans and strategies, including externally committed and non-committed credit agreements accessible by our Company and each of our operating subsidiaries. We believe these financing arrangements, along with cash flows from operating activities within the U.S., are sufficient to fund our current cash needs in the U.S. 
 Cash Flows and Use of Cash 
 Our business historically generates positive operating cash flows each year and our debt maturities are generally of a longer-term nature. However, our liquidity could be impacted significantly by the risk factors we described in Part I Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report, Part II. Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in this report and the items listed above. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 1,415.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 188.7 million compared to 1,604.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the unfavorable timing of working capital, partially offset by higher net income adjusted for non-cash addbacks and the timing of income taxes paid. The unfavorable timing of working capital was primarily driven by the timing of cash paid for our payables as well as higher payments for 2023 annual incentive compensation, partially offset by the timing of cash receipts. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 530.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 138.2 million compared to 668.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash paid in the prior year for an acquisition, partially offset by higher capital expenditures as a result of the timing of capital projects. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities of 744.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 16.2 million compared to 728.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher Class B common stock share repurchases and higher dividend payments, partially offset by lower net debt repayments.

 Capital Resources, including Material Cash Requirements 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total cash and cash equivalents of 1,021.7 million, compared to 868.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and 801.7 million as of September 30, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the net cash provided by operating activities, as well as the issuance of new EUR 800 million 3.8 senior notes due 2032, partially offset by net debt repayments, including the repayment of our EUR 800 million 1.25 senior notes which matured in July 2024, capital expenditures, Class B common stock share repurchases and dividend payments. 
 Borrowings 
 We repaid our EUR 800 million 1.25 senior notes upon their maturity on July 15, 2024 using the cash proceeds from our EUR 800 million 3.8 senior notes issued on May 29, 2024 and cash on hand. Refer to Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 7, "Debt" for details.

Based on the credit profile of our lenders that are party to our credit facilities, we are confident in our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if the need arises. On June 3, 2024, we amended our existing 2.0 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date from June 26, 2028 to June 26, 2029. As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.0 billion available to draw on our amended and restated 2.0 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings drawn on this amended and restated multi-currency revolving credit facility and no commercial paper borrowings. 
 We intend to further utilize our cross-border, cross currency cash pool as well as our commercial paper programs for liquidity as needed. We also have CAD, GBP and USD overdraft facilities across several banks should we need additional short-term liquidity. 
 Under the terms of each of our debt facilities, we must comply with certain restrictions. These include customary events of default and specified representations, warranties and covenants, as well as covenants that restrict our ability to incur certain additional priority indebtedness (certain thresholds of secured consolidated net tangible assets), certain leverage threshold percentages, create or permit liens on assets and restrictions on mergers, acquisitions and certain types of sale lease-back transactions. 
 The maximum net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined by the amended and restated multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement, was 4.00x as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all of these restrictions and covenants, have met such financial ratios and have met all debt payment obligations. All of our outstanding senior notes as of September 30, 2024 rank pari-passu. 
 See Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 7, "Debt" for further discussion of our borrowings and available sources of borrowings, including lines of credit. 
 Guarantees 
 We guarantee indebtedness and other obligations to banks and other third parties for some of our equity method investments and consolidated subsidiaries. See Part I . Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 10, "Commitments and Contingencies" for further discussion. 
 Material Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations 
 There were no material changes, except for the cash payment required for the mandatory purchase of the remaining 49.9 ownership interest in Cobra U.K. of 89 million which was made on October 21, 2024, to our material cash requirements from contractual and other obligations outside the ordinary course of business or due to factors similar in nature to inflation, changing prices on operations or changes in the remaining terms of the contracts since December 31, 2023, as reported in Part II.

Additionally, pursuant to the indenture dated July 7, 2016 ("July 2016 Indenture"), MCBC issued its outstanding 3.0 senior notes due 2026, 4.2 senior notes due 2046 and 1.25 senior notes due 2024 (subsequently repaid upon maturity on July 15, 2024). Further, pursuant to the indenture dated May 29, 2024 ("May 2024 Indenture"), MCBC issued its outstanding 3.8 senior notes due 2032. The issuances of the senior notes under the May 2012 Indenture, the July 2016 Indenture and the May 2024 Indenture were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain subsidiaries of MCBC, which are listed in Exhibit 22 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Subsidiary Guarantors, and together with the Parent Issuer, the "Obligor Group"). Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is 100 owned by the Parent Issuer. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. 
 None of our other outstanding debt was issued in a transaction that was registered with the SEC, and such other outstanding debt is issued or otherwise generally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Obligor Group or other consolidated subsidiaries of MCBC. These other guarantees are also full and unconditional and joint and several. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the senior notes and related guarantees rank pari-passu with all other unsubordinated debt of the Obligor Group and senior to all future subordinated debt of the Obligor Group. The guarantees can be released upon the sale or transfer of a Subsidiary Guarantors' capital stock or substantially all of its assets, or if such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a guarantor under our other outstanding debt. 
 See Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 7, "Debt" for details of all debt issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 The following summarized financial information relates to the Obligor Group as of September 30, 2024 on a combined basis, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances between the Obligor Group, and excluding the investments in and equity in the earnings of any non-guarantor subsidiaries. The balances and transactions with non-guarantor subsidiaries have been separately presented.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures that, by their nature, can only provide reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives. Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities that we do not control or manage. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
