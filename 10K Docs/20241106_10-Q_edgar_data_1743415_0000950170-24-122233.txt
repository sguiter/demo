 excise tax on this income. The Company will accrue excise tax on such estimated excess taxable income as appropriate. 

 (f) Book and tax basis differences relating to Unitholder distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are typically reclassified among the Company s capital accounts annually. In addition, the character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. 

 (g) Distributions to Unitholders are recorded as of the record date. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed or deemed distributed at least annually. 

 (h) In accordance with Regulation S-X and ASC Topic 810 Consolidation , the Company consolidates its interest in controlled investment company subsidiaries, financing subsidiaries and certain wholly-owned holding companies that serve to facilitate investment in portfolio companies. In addition, the Company may also consolidate any controlled operating companies substantially all of whose business consists of providing services to the Company. 

 (i) The accounting records of the Company are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the rate of exchange of such currencies against the U.S. dollar on the date of valuation. The Company will not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations would be included with the net unrealized gain or loss from investments. The Company s investments in foreign securities, if any, may involve certain risks, including without limitation: foreign exchange restrictions, expropriation, taxation or other political, social or economic risks, all of which could affect the market and/or credit risk of the investment. In addition, changes in the relationship of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar can significantly affect the value of these investments in terms of U.S. dollars and therefore the earnings of the Company. 

 (j) In accordance with ASC 835-30, the Company reports origination and other expenses related to certain debt issuances, if any, as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. Applicable expenses are deferred and amortized using either the effective interest method or the straight-line method over the stated life. The straight-line method may be used on revolving facilities and/or when it approximates the effective yield method.

Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements The Company typically determines the fair value of its performing debt investments utilizing a yield analysis. In a yield analysis, a price is ascribed for each investment based upon an assessment of current and expected market yields for similar investments and risk profiles. Additional consideration is given to current contractual interest rates, relative maturities and other key terms and risks associated with an investment. Among other factors, a significant determinant of risk is the amount of leverage used by the portfolio company relative to the total enterprise value of the company, and the rights and remedies of our investment within each portfolio company. Significant unobservable quantitative inputs typically used in the fair value measurement of the Company s Level 3 assets and liabilities primarily reflect current market yields, including indices, and readily available quotes from brokers, dealers, and pricing services as indicated by comparable assets and liabilities, as well as enterprise values, returns on equity and EBITDA multiples of similar companies, and comparable market transactions for equity securities.

The credit agreements governing the above loan commitments contain customary lending provisions and/or are subject to the respective portfolio company s achievement of certain milestones that allow relief to the Company from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying company experiences materially adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the company. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for the Company. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had sufficient cash available and/or liquid securities available to fund its commitments and had reviewed them for any appropriate fair value adjustment. In the normal course of our business, we invest or trade in various financial instruments and may enter into various investment activities with off-balance sheet risk, which may include forward foreign currency contracts. Generally, these financial instruments represent future commitments to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at future dates. These financial instruments contain varying degrees of off-balance sheet risk whereby changes in the market value or our satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, we held no such contracts. From time to time, the Company may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of its business. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, management is not aware of any material pending or threatened litigation that would require accounting recognition or financial statement disclosure.

Report of Inde pendent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Unitholders and Board of Directors SCP Private Credit Income BDC LLC: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of SCP Private Credit Income BDC LLC (and subsidiary) (the Company), including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and changes in unitholders capital for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedule of investments, of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in unitholders capital, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 27, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedule of investments, from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Overview SCP Private Credit Income BDC LLC (the Company, we, us or our was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware on May 18, 2018. We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ), and we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). As such, we are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets, source of income limitations, RIC asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90 of our taxable income and tax-exempt interest. In addition, we expect that all of the Company s total portfolio will be comprised of investments in the U.S. The Company was formed primarily to provide investors with attractive long-term returns through investments made pursuant to the investment strategy of the Company described below (the Company s investments in portfolio companies are referred to herein as Portfolio Investments ). The Adviser serves as the Company s investment adviser pursuant to an investment management agreement between the Company and the Adviser (as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the Investment Management Agreement ). Subject to the overall supervision of the Company s Board of Directors (the Board ), the Adviser is responsible for managing the Company s business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments, and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. The managing members of the Adviser are Michael Gross and Bruce Spohler, who also oversee the Adviser s investment committee. Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, the Adviser has also been appointed to provide administrative and coordination services to the Company (in such capacity, the Administrative Coordinator ). The Administrative Coordinator supervises or provides the Company s administrative services, including operational trade support, net asset value calculations, financial reporting, fund accounting and registrar and transfer agent services. The Administrative Coordinator also provides assistance to the Adviser in connection with communicating with investors and other persons with respect to the Company. The Company is organized primarily for investors who may invest through one or more investment funds created by one or more financial institutions unaffiliated with the Company (collectively, the Access Fund ). Certain other investors may also invest directly in the Company. For those investors who invest through the Access Fund, we expect the Access Fund will issue a pro rata interest to each investor in the Access Fund (the Access Fund Investors that, with respect to each Access Fund Investor s investment in the Access Fund, corresponds to the pro rata share of the Company s units (the Units issued by the Company to the Access Fund. We also expect that Units will only be sold (i) in the U.S. only to U.S. persons who are accredited investors within the meaning of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and (ii) outside the U.S. in accordance with 

 29 

Table of Contents 

Regulation S under the Securities Act. Upon a sale of Units to an investor, we expect the Access Fund will pass its voting rights in the Company through to the Access Fund Investors. The Company s principal focus is to invest in first lien secured floating rate loans primarily to upper middle market private leveraged companies (generally, loan sizes of 100 million to 300 million to companies with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization EBITDA between approximately 25 million and 100 million) that have significant free cash flow and are in non-cyclical industries in which the Adviser has direct experience. In addition to senior secured loans to upper middle market companies, the Company intends to invest a portion of its assets in non-traditional asset-based loans and first lien loans to rapidly growing healthcare companies. The Company also expects that some of its investments will contain delayed-draw term loan type features (which is a legally binding commitment by the Company to fund additional term loans to a borrower in the future) and/or other types of unfunded commitments. The Company expects to co-invest with other vehicles managed by the Adviser. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to co-invest with such other funds, including as a result of legal restrictions and contractual restrictions and, as a result, the Company may not be able to meet its investment objective. The Company believes the potential scale resulting from co-investments with vehicles managed by the Adviser will provide the Company a significant advantage to source loans over other lenders that do not have the capital base to provide significant debt financing. The Company is an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, and the Company may from time to time take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act. Recent Developments None. Revenues The Company s principal focus is to invest in first lien secured floating rate loans primarily to upper middle market private leveraged companies (generally, aggregate loan sizes of 100 million to 300 million to companies with EBITDA between approximately 25 million and 100 million) that have significant free cash flow and are in non-cyclical industries in which the Adviser has direct experience. In addition to senior secured loans to upper middle market companies, the Company intends to invest a portion of its assets in non-traditional asset-based loans and first lien loans to rapidly growing healthcare companies. Expenses The Company will (directly or indirectly) bear: (i) all of its fees, costs, expenses and liabilities, all of its investment-related fees, costs, expenses and liabilities (including with respect to amounts incurred prior to the Company s initial closing) and all of its other operating fees, costs, expenses and liabilities, including all fees, due diligence costs and other fees, costs, expenses and liabilities related to the identification, sourcing, evaluation, pursuit, acquisition, holding, appraisals, asset management, restructuring and disposing of investments, including all reasonable travel-related fees, costs, expenses and liabilities (such as lodging and meals), all fees, costs, expenses and liabilities of legal counsel and financial and other advisers incurred in connection therewith, all fees, costs, expenses and liabilities of information technology services relating to the ongoing management of investments, and all other investment-related fees, costs, expenses and liabilities (to the extent not reimbursed by the relevant portfolio company); 

 (ii) all fees, costs, expenses and liabilities related to any audits or agreed upon procedures, tax forms and return preparations and filings, custodian fees and expenses, fund accounting, administrator services, financial statement preparation and reporting, web services for the benefit of the Company s unitholders (the Unitholders ), delivery costs and expenses in connection with reporting obligations and communications and compliance services; 

 (iii) all fees, costs, expenses and liabilities relating to insurance policies (including director and officer liability insurance) maintained by or for the Company, including in respect of Portfolio Investments and/or personnel of the Adviser, the Administrative Coordinator and their affiliates; 

 (iv) other administrative fees, costs and liabilities; 

 (v) all fees, costs, expenses and liabilities of brokers, transaction finders and other intermediaries, including brokerage commissions and spreads, and all other transaction-related fees, costs, expenses and liabilities, including reverse break-up fees; 

 (vi) all fees, costs, expenses and liabilities relating to derivatives and hedging transactions;

(vii) all principal amounts of, and interest expense on, borrowings and guarantees, and all other fees, costs, expenses and liabilities arising out of borrowings and guarantees, including the arranging and maintenance thereof, whether incurred by the Company or incurred or facilitated by a special purpose vehicle that makes Portfolio Investments; 

 (viii) Management Fees and incentive fees; 

 (ix) administration fees; 

 (x) all fees, costs, expenses and liabilities incurred through the use or engagement of service providers; 

 (xi) all taxes, fees, penalties and other governmental charges levied against the Company and all fees, costs, expenses, penalties and liabilities related to tax compliance; 

 (xii) all fees, costs, expenses and liabilities of the Company s legal counsel related to extraordinary matters, including expenses for any dispute resolution (including litigation and regulatory-related legal expenses); 

 (xiii) all fees, costs, expenses and liabilities relating to legal and regulatory filings, including securities law filings relating to Portfolio Investments; 

 (xiv) all fees, costs, expenses and liabilities related to the Company s indemnification or contribution obligations; 

 (xv) all fees, costs, expenses and liabilities for subscription services (to the extent such subscription is required by the general partner of the Access Fund); 

 (xvi) any required regulatory filings and related legal fees; 

 (xvii) all fees, costs, expenses and liabilities related to liquidating the Company; 

 (xviii) transfer agent services; and 

 (xix) any other fees, costs, expenses and liabilities not specifically assumed by the Adviser or the Administrative Coordinator. 

 In addition, the aggregate amount of the annual operating expenses relating to Unitholders investing directly in the Company set forth in clauses (ii)-(iv) and the operating expenses included in clauses (xiii) and (xvi) related to U.S. regulatory bodies above borne by the Company (directly or indirectly) will not exceed the Operating Expense Cap, calculated as follows: (A) if the Company has less than or equal to 400 million in capital commitments Commitments ), an amount equal to the sum of (x) the product of the Commitments and 0.0025 and (y) 1.25 million, or (B) if the Company has greater than 400 million in Commitments, 2.25 million. Any amount in excess of the Operating Expense Cap for any fiscal year will be paid by the Adviser. Solely by way of example, if Commitments equal 350 million, the Operating Expense Cap will be equal to 2.125 million. For the avoidance of doubt, the Operating Expense Cap will not apply to any fees, costs, expenses and liabilities allocable to persons investing indirectly in the Company through any Unitholder. Additionally, the Company will not bear the costs of any third-party valuation agent engaged solely for purposes of valuing the net asset value of the Company. The Adviser or Administrative Coordinator and/or their affiliates have advanced organizational and offering expenses to the Company, which include organizational fees, costs, expenses and liabilities of the Company, including legal expenses, incurred in connection with the initial offering of Units and the formation and establishment of the Company. The Adviser or Administrative Coordinator (or such affiliate) has been reimbursed by the Company for such advanced costs and expenses in an amount that did not exceed 0.5 million. Accordingly, 0.3 million of offering expenses were charged to capital and 0.1 million of organizational costs were expensed in 2019. Portfolio and Investment Activity During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 18.0 million across 7 portfolio companies. This compares to investing 19.2 million in 11 portfolio companies during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Investments sold or prepaid during the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 62.8 million versus 28.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, our portfolio consisted of 36 portfolio companies and was invested 93.3 directly in senior secured loans, 2.8 in preferred equity and 3.9 in common equity/equity interests/warrants, versus 53 portfolio companies invested 97.4 directly in senior secured loans and 2.6 in common equity/equity interests/warrants at September 30, 2023, in each case measured at fair value. At September 30, 2024, 97.1 of our income producing investment portfolio was floating rate and 2.9 was fixed rate, measured at fair value. At September 30, 2023, 97.1 of our income producing investment portfolio was floating rate and 2.9 was fixed rate, measured at fair value.

Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies and disclosed subsequent events herein, we are not currently aware of any other reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Valuation of Portfolio Investments In December 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act addressing fair valuation of fund investments. The rule sets forth requirements for good faith determinations of fair value, as well as for the performance of fair value determinations, including related oversight and reporting obligations. The rule also defines readily available market quotations for purposes of the definition of value under the 1940 Act, and the SEC noted that this definition will apply in all contexts under the 1940 Act. The Company complies with the Rule 2a-5 valuation requirements. The Company conducts the valuation of its assets, pursuant to which the Company s net asset value (the NAV is determined, at all times consistent with GAAP and the 1940 Act. The Board will (1) periodically assess and manage valuation risks; (2) establish and apply fair value methodologies; (3) test fair value methodologies; (4) oversee and evaluate third-party pricing services, as applicable; (5) oversee the reporting required by Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act; and (6) maintain recordkeeping requirements under Rule 2a-5. It is anticipated that in respect of many of the Company s assets, readily available market quotations will not be obtainable and that such assets will be valued at fair value. A market quotation is readily available for a security only when that quotation is a quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for identical investments that the Company can access at the measurement date, provided that a quotation will not be readily available if it is not reliable. If the Company anticipates using a market quotation for a security, it will also monitor for circumstances that may necessitate the use of fair value, such as significant events that may cause concern over the reliability of a market quotation. For purposes of calculating the NAV, the Company s assets will generally be valued as described in Note 2(b) to the Company s consolidated financial statements. Leverage The Company is required to comply with the asset coverage requirements of the 1940 Act. The Company expects to employ leverage and otherwise incur indebtedness with respect to its portfolio both on a recourse and non-recourse basis (including and potentially through guarantees, derivatives, forward commitments and reverse repurchase agreements), but will not exceed the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. The Company is generally permitted, under specified conditions, to issue senior securities in amounts such that the Company s asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150 immediately after such issuance. In connection with the organization of the Company, the Adviser, as the initial Unitholder, has authorized the Company to adopt the 150 asset coverage ratio as of August 2, 2018. In connection with their subscriptions of the Units, our Unitholders were required to acknowledge our ability to operate with an asset coverage ratio that may be as low as 150 . The Company will be exposed to the risks of leverage, which may be considered a speculative investment technique. The use of leverage magnifies the potential for gain and loss on amounts invested and therefore increases the risks associated with investing in our securities. In addition, the costs associated with our borrowings, including any increase in the Management Fee payable to the Adviser, will be borne by our Unitholders. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 226.1 million of senior securities, for an asset coverage ratio of 184.5 . Taxation as a RIC The Company elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and intends to qualify for taxation as a RIC annually. As a RIC, the Company generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that it timely distributes to Unitholders as dividends. In order to qualify for taxation as a RIC, the Company is required, among other things, to be diversified at each quarter end and to timely distribute to its Unitholders at least 90 of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. There is no guarantee the Company will be able to maintain its status as a RIC. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a given tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions, the Company will accrue an estimated excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements None. Results of Operations Results are shown below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023: Investment Income For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross investment income totaled 12.1 million and 37.2 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, gross investment income totaled 15.8 million and 45.9 million, respectively. The comparative decrease in gross investment income is due to a reduction in the size of the income-producing portfolio. Expenses Expenses totaled 6.1 million and 18.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, of which 1.8 million and 6.4 million, respectively, were management, incentive and administration fees and 4.2 million and 11.2 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Administrative services, organization and other general and administrative expenses totaled 0.1 million and 0.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Administrative services, organization and other general and administrative expenses totaled 0.2 million and 0.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Expenses generally consist of management fees, administration fees, performance-based incentive fees, insurance, legal expenses, directors expenses, audit and tax expenses and other general and administrative expenses. Interest and other credit facility expenses generally consist of interest, unused fees, agency fees and loan origination fees, if any, among others. The comparative decrease in expenses is generally due to lower interest expense from deleveraging earlier in the year.

Net Change in Unrealized Loss For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net change in unrealized loss on the Company s assets totaled 0.2 million and 0.2 million, respectively. Net unrealized loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to depreciation on our investments in SLR-AMI Topco Blocker, LLC and RQM+ Corp., among others, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized appreciation on Neuronetics, Inc. and Alimera Sciences, Inc., partially offset by appreciation on our investments in Veronica Holdings, LLC and Outset Medical, Inc., among others. Net unrealized loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to depreciation on our investments in RQM+ Corp., SLR-AMI Topco Blocker, LLC and TAUC Management, LLC, among others, partially offset by appreciation on our investments in Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc., Veronica Holdings, LLC and Outset Medical, Inc., among others. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, net change in unrealized loss on the Company s assets totaled 0.1 million and 8.3 million, respectively. Net unrealized loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to depreciation on our investments in Peter C. Foy Associates Insurance Services, LLC, among others, partially offset by appreciation on our investments in Alimera Sciences, Inc. and GSM Acquisition Corp., among others. Net unrealized loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to depreciation on our investments in Oldco AI, LLC (f/k/a Amerimark), TAUC Management, LLC and Peter C. Foy Associates Insurance Services, LLC, among others, partially offset by appreciation on our investments in World Insurance Associates, LLC, iCIMS, Inc. and Pinnacle Treatment Centers, Inc., among others. Net Increase in Unitholders Capital Resulting From Operations For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net increase in Unitholders capital resulting from operations of 5.7 million and 18.8 million, respectively. For the same period, income per average Unit was 0.22 and 0.71, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had a net increase in Unitholders capital resulting from operations of 7.3 million and 13.3 million, respectively. For the same period, income per average Unit was 0.29 and 0.55, respectively. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary uses of cash are for (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying the Adviser), (iii) debt service of any borrowings, and (iv) cash distributions to our Unitholders. Equity During the period March 12, 2019 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2024, on a net basis, the Company sold and issued 18,532,519 Units at an average price of 10.48 per Unit, for net proceeds of 194.3 million. All of our outstanding Units were issued and sold in reliance upon the available exemptions from registration requirements of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Unfunded equity capital commitments totaled 131.7 million at September 30, 2024. Debt Revolving credit facility due August 2024 (the SPV Facility On February 27, 2019, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, SCP Private Credit Income BDC SPV LLC (the SPV ), entered into the SPV Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acting as administrative agent. Effective with the latest amendment dated October 20, 2023, the stated interest rate on the SPV Facility was SOFR plus 2.70 with no floor requirement and the final maturity date was August 15, 2024. Maximum commitments were 261.4 million. On August 2, 2024, the Company prepaid the SPV Facility in full. Term credit facility due August 2027 (the DB Facility On August 2, 2024, the Company and the SPV established the DB Facility with Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch as lender. The DB Facility has a total commitment of approximately 226.1 million, a maturity date of August 2, 2027 and an applicable margin of S+265. The DB Facility is secured by all of the assets held by the SPV. Under the terms of the DB Facility, the Company and SPV, as applicable, have made certain customary representations and warranties, and are required to comply with various covenants, including leverage restrictions, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The DB Facility also includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature. As of September 30, 2024, there were 226.1 million of borrowings outstanding under the DB Facility. Revolving credit facility due December 2024 (the Subscription Facility During the first quarter of 2019, the Company established the Subscription Facility with East West Bank. Effective with the latest amendment dated December 22, 2023, the Subscription Facility s size is 32.0 million with a stated interest rate of SOFR plus 2.95 and a maturity date of December 31, 2024. Under the

terms of the Subscription Facility, the Company has made certain customary representations and warranties and is required to comply with various covenants, including reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The Subscription Facility also includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature. As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Subscription Facility. Cash Equivalents We deem certain U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and other high-quality, short-term debt securities as cash equivalents. The Company makes purchases that are consistent with its purpose of making investments in securities described in paragraphs 1 through 3 of Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. From time to time, including at or near the end of each fiscal quarter, we consider using various temporary investment strategies for our business. One strategy includes taking proactive steps by utilizing cash equivalents as temporary assets with the objective of enhancing our investment flexibility pursuant to Section 55 of the 1940 Act. More specifically, from time-to-time we may purchase U.S. Treasury bills or other high-quality, short-term debt securities at or near the end of the quarter and typically close out the position on a net cash basis subsequent to quarter end. We may also utilize repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions, including drawing down on our credit facilities, as deemed appropriate. The amount of these transactions or such drawn cash for this purpose are excluded from total assets for purposes of computing the asset base upon which the Management Fee is determined. We held no cash equivalents at September 30, 2024. Contractual Obligations We have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. We have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with the Adviser in accordance with the 1940 Act. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Company will pay the Adviser the Management Fee and the incentive fee, and the Administrative Coordinator the administration fee. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Administrative Coordinator may engage or delegate certain administrative functions to third parties or affiliates on behalf of the Company. The Administrative Coordinator will be responsible for all expenses of its own staff responsible for (i) certain on-going, routine, non-investment-related administrative services for the Company, (ii) the coordination of various third-party services needed or required by the Company, and (iii) certain Unitholder servicing functions. A summary of our significant contractual payment obligations is as follows as of September 30, 2024:

 If any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under the Investment Management Agreement. Any new investment advisory agreement would also be subject to approval by our Unitholders.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements From time-to-time and in the normal course of business, the Company may make unfunded capital commitments to current or prospective portfolio companies. Typically, the Company may agree to provide delayed-draw term loans or, to a lesser extent, revolving loans or equity commitments. These unfunded capital commitments always take into account the Company s liquidity and cash available for investment, portfolio and issuer diversification, and other considerations. Accordingly, the Company had the following unfunded capital commitments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively:

The credit agreements governing the above loan commitments contain customary lending provisions and/or are subject to the respective portfolio company s achievement of certain milestones that allow relief to the Company from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying company experiences materially adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the company. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for the Company. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had sufficient cash available and/or liquid securities available to fund its commitments. Distributions Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to Unitholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year. Future quarterly distributions, if any, will be determined by our Board. We expect that our distributions to Unitholders will generally be from accumulated net investment income, net realized capital gains or non-taxable return of capital, if any, as applicable. We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must distribute at least 90 of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment. We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC, we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions. Also, our revolving credit facilities may limit our ability to declare distributions if we default under certain provisions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a RIC. In addition, in accordance with GAAP and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as contractual payment-in-kind income, which represents contractual income added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a RIC.

With respect to the distributions to Unitholders, income from origination, structuring, closing and certain other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are treated as taxable income and, accordingly, distributed to Unitholders. Related Parties We have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with the Adviser. Mr. Michael S. Gross, our Chairman, Co-Chief Executive Officer and President and Mr. Bruce J. Spohler, our Co-Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and board member, are managing members and senior investment professionals of, and have financial and controlling interests in, the Adviser. In addition, Mr. Shiraz Y. Kajee, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer serves as the Chief Financial Officer for the Adviser and Mr. Guy F. Talarico, our Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, serves as Partner, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer for the Adviser. The Adviser may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. For example, the Adviser presently serves as investment adviser to SLR Investment Corp., a publicly traded BDC, which focuses on investing in senior secured loans, financing leases and, to a lesser extent, unsecured loans and equity securities, SLR HC BDC LLC, an unlisted BDC whose principal focus is to invest directly and indirectly in senior secured loans and other debt instruments typically to middle market companies within the healthcare industry, and SLR Private Credit BDC II LLC, an unlisted BDC whose principal focus is to invest in first lien senior secured floating rate loans primarily to upper middle market leveraged companies with EBITDA between approximately 25 million and 250 million that have significant free cash flow and are in non-cyclical industries in which the Adviser has significant experience. In addition, Mr. Gross, our Chairman, Co-Chief Executive Officer and President, Mr. Spohler, our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Kajee, our Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Talarico, our Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, serve in similar capacities for SLR Investment Corp., SLR HC BDC LLC and SLR Private Credit BDC II LLC. The Adviser and certain investment advisory affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Adviser or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Adviser s allocation procedures. On June 13, 2017, the Adviser received an exemptive order that permits the Company to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions with certain affiliates, in a manner consistent with the Company s investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, and pursuant to various conditions (the Order ). If the Company is unable to rely on the Order for a particular opportunity, such opportunity will be allocated first to the entity whose investment strategy is the most consistent with the opportunity being allocated, and second, if the terms of the opportunity are consistent with more than one entity s investment strategy, on an alternating basis. Although the Adviser s investment professionals will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, the Company and its Unitholders could be adversely affected to the extent investment opportunities are allocated among us and other investment vehicles managed or sponsored by, or affiliated with, our executive officers, directors and members of the Adviser. In addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our officers and directors. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. Item 3. Quantitativ e and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Uncertainty with respect to interest rates, inflationary pressures, risks in respect of a failure to increase the U.S. debt ceiling or a downgrade in the U.S. credit rating, the war between Ukraine and Russia, certain regional bank failures, an inflationary environment, the ongoing war in the Middle East and health epidemics and pandemics introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effects of this volatility have materially impacted and could continue to materially impact our market risks. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In a low interest rate environment, including a reduction of SOFR to zero, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net interest income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, such difference could potentially increase thereby increasing our net investment income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, certain investments in our investment portfolio had floating interest rates. These floating rate investments were primarily based on floating SOFR and typically have durations of one to three months after which they reset to recent market interest rates. Additionally, some of these investments have floors. The Company also has revolving credit facilities that are generally based on floating SOFR. Assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and no new defaults by portfolio companies, a hypothetical one percent decrease in SOFR on our comprehensive floating rate assets and liabilities would decrease our net investment income by approximately five cents per average Unit over the next twelve months. Assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of

September 30, 2024 and no new defaults by portfolio companies, a hypothetical one percent increase in SOFR on our comprehensive floating rate assets and liabilities would increase our net investment income by approximately five cents per average Unit over the next twelve months. However, we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from time-to-time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options, swaps and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in any benefits of certain changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. At September 30, 2024, we have no interest rate hedging instruments outstanding on our balance sheet.

Item 4. Co ntrols and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has not identified any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OT HER INFORMATION Item 1. Le gal Proceedings We and our consolidated subsidiary are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us or our consolidated subsidiary. From time to time, we and our consolidated subsidiary may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.

SCP PRIVATE CREDIT INCOME BDC LLC CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT 

CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT TABLE OF CONTENTS Page Appendices Code Acknowledgment	A-1 List of Covered Officers	B-1 

 ii 

CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT Introduction Ethics are important to SCP Private Credit Income BDC LLC Fund , our , us , or we and to its management. The Fund is committed to the highest ethical standards and to conducting its business with the highest level of integrity. All officers, directors and employees of the Fund, its investment adviser, SLR Capital Partners, LLC (the investment adviser is responsible for maintaining this level of integrity and for complying with the policies contained in this Code of Business Conduct (the Code ). If you have a question or concern about what is proper conduct for you or anyone else, please raise these concerns with any member of the Fund s management, or follow the procedures outlined in applicable sections of this Code. Purpose of the Code This Code applies to the Fund s principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions (collectively, the Covered Officers each of whom is set forth in Appendix B), as well as any other officers, directors and employees of the Fund or the investment adviser (collectively, with the Covered Officers, the Covered Persons ). The Code is intended to: help Covered Persons recognize ethical issues and take the appropriate steps to resolve these issues; 

 deter ethical violations; 

 assist Covered Persons in reporting any unethical or illegal conduct; and 

 reaffirm and promote our commitment to a corporate culture that values honesty and accountability. 

 All Covered Persons, as a condition of employment or continued employment, will acknowledge in writing that they have received a copy of this Code, read it, and understand that the Code contains our expectations regarding their conduct. Conflicts of Interest Covered Persons must avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between their personal interests and our interests. A conflict exists when a Covered Person s personal interest in any way interferes with our interests, or when Covered Persons take any action or have any interest that may make it difficult for them to perform their job objectively and effectively. Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser of which the Covered Officer is an employee, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions which will have different effects on the investment adviser and the Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. 

 1 

Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Board of Directors that the Covered Officers may also be or in the future become officers or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other Codes. Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Persons should keep in mind that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal interest of a Covered Person should not be placed improperly before the interest of the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest probably exists if: A Covered Person causes us, the investment adviser, to enter into business relationships with the Covered Person or a member of his or her family, or invest in companies affiliated with the Covered Person or a member of his or her family; 

 a Covered Person uses any nonpublic information about us, the investment adviser, our customers or our other business partners for his or her personal gain, or the gain of a member of his or her family; or 

 a Covered Person uses or communicates confidential information obtained in the course of his or her work for the Covered Person s or another s personal benefit. 

 Corporate Opportunities Each of us has a duty to advance the legitimate interests of the Fund when the opportunity to do so presents itself. Therefore, Covered Persons may not: take for themselves personally opportunities, including investment opportunities, discovered through the use of their position with us or the investment adviser, or through the use of either s property or information; 

 use our, the investment adviser s property, information, or position for their personal gain or the gain of a family member; or 

 compete, or prepare to compete, with us or the investment adviser. 

 Confidentiality Covered Persons must not disclose confidential information regarding us, the investment adviser, our affiliates, our lenders, our clients, or our other business partners, unless disclosure is authorized or required by law. Confidential information includes all non- public information that might be harmful to, or useful to the competitors of, the Fund, our affiliates, our lenders, our clients, or our other business partners. Fair Dealing Covered Persons must endeavor to deal fairly with our customers, suppliers and business partners, or any other companies or individuals with whom we do business or come into contact with, including 

 2 

fellow employees and our competitors. Covered Persons must not take unfair advantage of these or other parties by means of: manipulation; 

 concealment; 

 abuse of privileged information; 

 misrepresentation of material facts; or 

 any other unfair-dealing practice. 

 Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets Our assets are to be used only for legitimate business purposes. Covered Persons should protect our assets and ensure that they are used efficiently. Incidental personal use of telephones, fax machines, copy machines, personal computers and similar equipment is generally allowed if there is no significant added cost to us, it does not interfere with any Covered Person s work duties, and is not related to an illegal activity or to any outside business. Compliance with Applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations Each Covered Person has a duty to comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to our business. Highlighted below are some of the key compliance guidelines that must be followed. Insider trading . It is against the law to buy or sell securities using material information that is not available to the public. Individuals who give this inside information to others may be liable to the same extent as the individuals who trade while in possession of such information. Covered Persons must not trade in our securities, or the securities of our affiliates, our lenders, our clients, or our other business partners while in the possession of inside information. 

 Whistleblower protections . It is against the law to discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or discriminate in any manner against an employee who provides information or otherwise assists in investigations or proceedings relating to violations of federal securities laws or other federal laws prohibiting fraud against shareholders. Covered Persons must not discriminate in any way against an employee who engages in these whistleblower activities. 

 Investment Company Act requirements . A separate code of ethics has been established to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is applicable to those persons designated in such code. 

 Document retention . Covered Persons must adhere to appropriate procedures governing the retention and destruction of records consistent with applicable laws, regulations and our policies. Covered Persons may not destroy, alter or falsify any document that may be relevant to a threatened or pending lawsuit or governmental investigation. 

 Please talk to any member of senior management if you have questions about how to comply with the above regulations and other laws, rules and regulations. 

 3 

Equal Opportunity, Harassment We are committed to providing equal opportunity in all of our employment practices including selection, hiring, promotion, transfer, and compensation of all qualified applicants and employees without regard to race, color, sex or gender, religion, age, national origin, handicap, disability, citizenship status, or any other status protected by law. With this in mind, there are certain behaviors that will not be tolerated. These include harassment, violence, intimidation, and discrimination of any kind involving race, color, religion, gender, age, national origin, disability, or marital status. Accuracy of Company Records We require honest and accurate recording and reporting of information in order to make responsible business decisions. This includes such data as quality, safety, and personnel records, as well as financial records. All financial books, records and accounts must accurately reflect transactions and events, and conform both to required accounting principles and to our system of internal controls. No false or artificial entries may be made. Retaining Business Communications The law requires us to maintain certain types of corporate records, usually for specified periods of time. Failure to retain those records for those minimum periods could subject us to penalties and fines, cause the loss of rights, obstruct justice, place us in contempt of court, or seriously disadvantage us in litigation. From time to time we establish retention or destruction policies in order to ensure legal compliance. We expect Covered Persons to fully comply with any published records retention or destruction policies, provided that Covered Persons should note the following exception: If any Covered Person believes, or we inform any Covered Person, that our records are relevant to any litigation or governmental action, or any potential litigation or action, then the Covered Person must preserve those records until we determine the records are no longer needed. This exception supersedes any previously or subsequently established destruction policies for those records. If a Covered Person believes that this exception may apply, or has any questions regarding the possible applicability of that exception, he or she should contact our Chief Compliance Officer. Political Contributions No funds of the Fund may be given directly to political candidates. Covered Persons may, however, engage in political activity with their own resources on their own time. Media Relations We must speak with a unified voice in all dealings with the press and other media. As a result, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Operating Officer are the only contacts for media seeking information about the Fund. Any requests from the media must be referred to our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Operating Officer.

Intellectual Property Information Information generated in our business is a valuable asset. Protecting this information plays an important role in our growth and ability to compete. Such information includes business and research plans; objectives and strategies; trade secrets; unpublished financial information; salary and benefits data; lender and other business partner lists. Covered Persons who have access to our intellectual property information are obligated to safeguard it from unauthorized access and: Not disclose this information to persons outside of the Fund; 

 Not use this information for personal benefit or the benefit of persons outside of the Fund; and 

 Not share this information with other Covered Persons except on a legitimate need to know basis. 

 Internet and E-Mail Policy We provide an e-mail system and Internet access to certain of our employees to help them do their work. Covered Persons may use the e-mail system and the Internet only for legitimate business purposes in the course of their duties. Incidental and occasional personal use is permitted, but never for personal gain or any improper use. Further, Covered Persons are prohibited from discussing or posting information regarding the Fund in any external electronic forum, including Internet chat rooms or electronic bulletin boards. Reporting Violations and Complaint Handling Covered Persons are responsible for compliance with the rules, standards and principles described in this Code. In addition, Covered Persons should be alert to possible violations of the Code by the Fund s, the investment adviser s employees, officers and directors, and are expected to report a violation promptly. Normally, reports should be made to one s immediate supervisor. Under some circumstances, it may be impractical or feel uncomfortable raising a matter with a supervisor. In those instances, Covered Persons are encouraged to contact our Chief Compliance Officer who will investigate and report the matter to our Chief Executive Officer and/or Board of Directors, as the circumstance dictates. Covered Persons will also be expected to cooperate in an investigation of a violation. Anyone who has a concern about our conduct, the conduct of an officer of the Fund, its investment adviser or our accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, may communicate that concern to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors by direct communication with our Chief Compliance Officer or by email or in writing. All reported concerns shall be forwarded to the Audit Committee and will be simultaneously addressed by our Chief Compliance Officer in the same way that other concerns are addressed by us. The status of all outstanding concerns forwarded to the Audit Committee will be reported on a quarterly basis by our Chief Compliance Officer. The Audit Committee may direct that certain matters be presented to the full board and may also direct special treatment, including the retention of outside advisors or counsel, for any concern reported to it. All reports will be investigated and whenever possible, requests for confidentiality shall be honored. And, while anonymous reports will be accepted, please understand that anonymity may hinder or impede the investigation of a report. All cases of questionable activity or improper actions will be reviewed for appropriate action, discipline or corrective actions. Whenever possible, we will keep confidential the identity of employees, officers or directors who are accused of violations, unless or until it has been determined that a violation has occurred. 

 5 

There will be no reprisal, retaliation or adverse action taken against any Covered Person who, in good faith, reports or assists in the investigation of, a violation or suspected violation, or who makes an inquiry about the appropriateness of an anticipated or actual course of action.

Sanctions for Code Violations All violations of the Code will result in appropriate corrective action, up to and including dismissal. If the violation involves potentially criminal activity, the individual or individuals in question will be reported, as warranted, to the appropriate authorities. Application/Waivers All the directors, officers and employees of the Fund, its investment adviser and are subject to this Code. Insofar as other policies or procedures of the Fund, its investment adviser govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of all persons who are subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code.

IV. PERSONAL INVESTMENT AND TRADING POLICY 

 A. General Statement 

 SLR Capital is committed to maintaining the highest standard of business conduct. SLR Capital and its Supervised Persons must not act or behave in any manner or engage in any activity that (1) involves or creates even the suspicion or appearance of the misuse of material, nonpublic information by SLR Capital or any Supervised Person or (2) gives rise to, or appears to give rise to, any breach of fiduciary duty owed to any Client or investor. In addition, the Federal Securities Laws require that investment advisers maintain a record of every transaction in any Security, with certain exceptions, as described below, in which any Access Person acquires or disposes of Beneficial Ownership where the Security is or was held in an account over which the Access Person has direct or indirect influence or control. Given the current size of its operations, SLR Capital has chosen to require reporting of transactions, as well as pre-approval of certain transactions, for all Supervised Persons (subject to the specific exceptions in the Code), rather than only Access Persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Disinterested Directors are not subject to the preclearance and reporting requirements of the Code. However, with respect to the Company s securities Disinterested Directors must transact during the window periods as described in Appendix VII of this Code of Ethics and subsequently report the transaction detail to the Company on the day of the transaction. SLR Capital has developed the following policies and procedures relating to personal trading in Securities and the reporting of such personal trading in Securities in order to ensure that each Supervised Person satisfies the requirements of this Code. B. Requirements of this Code 

 1. Duty to Comply with Applicable Laws. 

 All Supervised Persons are required to comply with the Federal Securities Laws, the fiduciary duty owed by Adviser to its Clients, as applicable, and this Code. 2. Insider Trading Controls 

 All Supervised Persons are required to comply with the Insider Trading Policies and Procedures adopted by the Adviser and the BDC which appears as Appendix VII of this Code of Ethics and is incorporated herein by this reference. 3. Duty to Report Violations. 

 Each Supervised Person is required by law to promptly notify the Chief Compliance Officer or designee in the event he or she knows or has reason to believe that he or she or any other Supervised Person has violated any provision of this Code. If a Supervised Person knows or has reason to believe that the Chief Compliance Officer has violated any provision of this Code, the Supervised Person must promptly notify the Chief Financial Officer and is not required to notify the Chief Compliance Officer. SLR Capital is committed to fostering a culture of compliance. SLR Capital therefore urges you to contact the Chief Compliance Officer or designee if you have any questions regarding compliance. You will not be penalized and your status at SLR Capital will not be jeopardized by communicating with the 

 A- 5 

Chief Compliance Officer. Reports of violations or a suspected violations also may be submitted anonymously to the Chief Compliance Officer or designee. Any retaliatory action taken against any person who in good faith reports a violation or a suspected violation of this Code is itself a violation of this Code and cause for appropriate corrective action, including dismissal. 4. Supervised Personnel to be Supplied Copies, and Furnish Acknowledgements of Receipt of the Code of Ethics and Any Amendments Thereof. 

 SLR Capital will provide all Supervised Persons with a copy of this Code and all subsequent amendments. By law, all Supervised Persons must in turn provide written acknowledgement to the Chief Compliance Officer or designee of their initial receipt and review of this Code, their annual review of this Code and their receipt and review of any subsequent amendments to this Code. C. Restrictions on Supervised Persons Trading in Securities 

 1. Generally. 

 Purchases of Reportable Securities (other than Broad-Based Securities) by Supervised Persons and participation by Supervised Persons in an Initial Public Offering or Limited Offering require advance preclearance approval, in writing, by a Compliance Officer together with the specific approval of both Partners. Sales of Reportable Securities (other than Broad-Based Securities) by Supervised Persons require advance preclearance approval, in writing, by a Compliance Officer together with the specific approval of both Partners. All Supervised Person personal trading in Securities (other than Broad-Based Securities) is subject to the following further requirements and/or restrictions. (a) Any transaction in a Security subject to the Restricted List of issuers maintained by SLR Capital is strictly prohibited. 

 (b) Any transaction in a Security which the Supervised Person knows or has reason to know is being purchased or sold, or is being considered for purchase or sale, by or on behalf of a Client is prohibited until the Client s transaction has been completed or consideration of the transaction is abandoned. A Security is being considered for purchase or sale the earlier of (i) when a recommendation to purchase or sell has been made and communicated or (ii) the Security is placed on Adviser s research project lists or, (iii) with respect to the Supervised Person making the recommendation, when the Supervised Person seriously considers making such a recommendation. 

 (c) No Supervised Person may engage in a transaction in a Security, which includes an interest in a Fund, if the Supervised Person s transaction would otherwise disadvantage or appear to disadvantage a Client or if the Supervised Person would inappropriately profit from or appear to so profit from the transaction, whether or not at the expense of the Client. For the avoidance of doubt, this prohibition applies to any Security held, at the time of a personal transaction, in any Client account . 

 (d) Any transaction in a Security during the period which begins three days before and ends three days after any Client has traded in that Security is prohibited, unless approved by a Compliance Officer. 

 (e) No matched purchases and sales, or sales and purchases, in the same Security 

A- 6 

within a thirty-day period may be transacted without the advance approval of a Compliance Officer. This is requirement is reviewed on a first-in, first-out basis. This means that a security that is already in someone s portfolio may be sold within thirty-days of a purchase if certain shares of that security were in the portfolio prior to the thirty-day period. 

 (f) Personal account trading must be done on the Supervised Person s own time without placing undue burden on SLR Capital s time. 

 (g) No personal trades should be undertaken which are beyond the financial resources of the Supervised Person. 

 (h) For the avoidance of doubt : 

 (i) Supervised Person Transactions in Broad-Based Securities are subject to the reporting, but not the preclearance requirements of this Code. 

 (ii) Supervised Person Transactions in Reportable Securities other than Broad-Based Securities are subject to both the preclearance and the reporting requirements of this Code. 

 (iii) Supervised Person Transactions by Disinterested Directors are not subject to the preclearance and reporting requirements of this Code. However, with respect to the Company s securities Disinterested Directors must transact during the window periods and subsequently report the transaction detail to the Company on the day of the transaction. 

 2. Accounts of Record 

 (a) You may not hold, and you may not permit any other person or entity to hold, on your behalf, any publicly traded Reportable Securities in which you have, or by reason of a Supervised Person Purchase Transaction (as hereinafter defined) will acquire, a Beneficial Ownership Interest, except through an account of record with the Adviser maintained with a bank or registered broker-dealer custodian (a custodian or a registered investment adviser. An account of record is defined as an official, documented account with the Adviser where all holdings of publicly traded Reportable Securities with a Beneficial Ownership Interest must be maintained. This account must be held with a bank, registered broker-dealer custodian, or registered investment adviser, ensuring that the Adviser has a complete and accurate record of these holdings. 

 (b) You must provide written notice to a Compliance Officer of your opening of an account with a bank or broker-dealer custodian or an investment adviser through which you (or your investment adviser, acting on your behalf) have the ability to purchase or sell publicly traded Reportable Securities promptly after opening the account, and in any event before the first order for the purchase or sale of such Securities is placed through the account. A Compliance Officer will then ask you to complete and sign a written notice to the account custodian or investment adviser (the forms of which are attached as Appendix IV and Appendix V hereto) which discloses your affiliation with the Adviser and requests that duplicate hard copies of trade confirmations and periodic statements reflecting all holdings and transactions within the account be promptly and confidentially sent to the attention of the Chief Compliance Officer. 1 A Compliance Officer will review and, upon approval, transmit the notice to your account custodian or 

1 In lieu of using the referenced Appendices requesting the forwarding of hard-copy confirmations and account statements, the Adviser will ordinarily ask, if feasible, that the account custodian agree to establish an automatic electronic feed of all account holding and transaction activity to the Adviser s area of the Personal Trade Compliance Center PTCC online cloud system which the Adviser has licensed from Compliance Science, Inc. A- 7 

investment adviser. 

 3. Transactions of Immediate Family Members. 

 There is a presumption that a Supervised Person can exert some measure of influence or control over accounts held by members of such person s Immediate Family sharing the same household. Therefore, transactions by Immediate Family members sharing the same household are subject to the policies herein. A Supervised Person may rebut this presumption by presenting convincing evidence, in writing, to the Chief Compliance Officer and request an exemption to one or more policies herein. All exemptions must be approved by the Chief Compliance Officer, in writing. 4. The following are Exempt Transactions that do not require preclearance by a Compliance Officer: 

 (a) Any transaction in Securities in an account over which a Supervised Person does not have any direct or indirect influence or control (such as a fully discretionary managed account through a registered investment adviser) except for IPOs and private securities. To rely upon this exemption, Supervised Persons must provide: (1) information about a trustee or third party manager s relationship to the Supervised Person (i.e., independent professional versus friend or relative; unaffiliated versus affiliated firm); (2) periodic certifications regarding the Supervised Persons influence or control over trusts or accounts (or obtain the certification from the third party manager or trustee when requested); and (3) when requested, reports on holdings and/or transactions made in the trust or discretionary account to identify transactions that would have been prohibited pursuant to the Code of Ethics, absent reliance on the reporting exemption. 

 (b) Purchases of Securities under Automatic Investment Plans (such as an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan). 

 (c) Purchases of Securities by exercise of rights issued to the holders of a class of Securities pro rata, to the extent they are issued with respect to Securities in which a Supervised Person has a Beneficial Ownership Interest. 

 (d) Acquisitions or dispositions of Securities as the result of a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, merger, consolidation, spin-off or other similar corporate distribution or reorganization applicable to all holders of a class of Securities in which a Supervised Person has a Beneficial Ownership Interest.

 5. Supervised Person Transaction Preclearance and Execution Procedures 

 The following procedures shall govern all transactions in which a Supervised Person or their immediate family members sharing the same household will sell (a Supervised Person Sale Transaction or acquire (a Supervised Person Purchase Transaction together with Supervised Person Sale Transaction , a Supervised Person Transaction a Beneficial Ownership Interest and which are subject to the requirement of securing advance preclearance approval, in writing, by a Compliance Officer.

Responses on behalf of such Compliance Officer and both Partners will be conveyed, confidentially and in writing ordinarily via email, within two (2) business days regarding Supervised Person Transaction requests involving publicly traded Reportable Securities and five (5) business days regarding Transaction requests involving other Reportable Securities. (i) Supervised Person Purchase Transactions. 

 Preclearance of Supervised Person Purchase Transactions may be withheld for any reason, or no reason, in the sole discretion of the Chief Compliance Officer and both Partners. (ii) Supervised Person Sale Transactions.

The determination that a Supervised Person may unfairly benefit from, or that a Supervised Person Sale may conflict with or appears to be in conflict with, a Client Transaction will be subjective and individualized, and may include questions about the timely and adequate dissemination of information, availability of bids and offers, and other factors deemed pertinent for an individual Client transaction or series of transactions. It is possible that a disapproval of a Supervised Person Sale could be costly to a Supervised Person or members of a Supervised Person s family; therefore, each Supervised Person should take great care to adhere to SLR Capital s trading restrictions and avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest. Any disapproval of a Supervised Person Sale Transaction shall be in writing. A Supervised Person may appeal any such disapproval by written notice to the Partners within two business days after receipt of notice of disapproval. (b) Executions of Supervised Person Transactions.

A report documenting the above review and any exceptions noted will be prepared by the Chief Compliance Officer and circulated to the Partners within 60 days of the end of the quarter in which the reports were received. Review of submitted holding and transaction reports will include not only an assessment of whether the Access Person followed all required procedures of this Code, such as preclearance, but may also: compare the personal trading to any restricted lists; assess whether the Access Person is trading for his or her own account in the same securities he or she is trading for Clients, and, if so, whether the Clients are receiving terms as favorable as the Access Person receives; periodically analyze the Access Person s trading for patterns that may indicate abuse, including market timing; investigate any substantial disparities between the quality of performance the Access Person achieves for his or her own account and that he or she achieves for Clients; and investigate any substantial disparities between the percentage of trades that are profitable when the Access Person trades for his or her own account and the percentage that are profitable when he or she places trades for Clients.

The following examples illustrate this principle: (i) ordinarily, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all Securities owned by members of your Immediate Family who share the same household with you; (ii) if you are a general partner of a general or limited partnership, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all Securities held by the partnership; (iii) if you are a shareholder of a corporation or similar business entity, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all Securities held by the corporation if you are a controlling shareholder or have or share investment control over the corporation s investment portfolio; (iv) if you have the right to acquire equity Securities through the exercise or conversion of a derivative Security, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in the Securities, whether or not your right is presently exercisable; (v) if you are the sole member or a manager of a limited liability company, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in the Securities held by the limited liability company; and (vi) ordinarily, if you are a trustee or beneficiary of a trust, where either you or members of your Immediate Family have a vested interest in the principal or income of the trust, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all Securities held by that trust.

1.	 Transactions required to be reported . You should report every transaction in which you acquired or disposed of any Security in which you had a Pecuniary Interest during the calendar quarter. The term Beneficial Ownership Interest is the subject of a long history of opinions and releases issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission and generally means that you would receive the pecuniary benefits of owning a Security. The term includes, but is not limited to the following cases and any other examples in the Code: (A)	Where the Security is held for your benefit by others, such as brokers, custodians, banks and pledgees; (B)	Where the Security is held for the benefit of members of your Immediate Family sharing the same household; (C)	Where Securities are held by a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, investment club or other entity in which you have an equity interest if you are a controlling equity holder, or you have or share investment control over the Securities held by the entity; (D)	Where Securities are held in a trust for which you are a trustee and under which either you or any member of your Immediate Family have a vested interest in the principal or income; and (E)	Where Securities are held in a trust for which you are the settlor, unless the consent of all of the beneficiaries is required in order for you to revoke the trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following transactions are not required to be reported: (A)	Transactions in Securities which are direct obligations of the United States; (B)	Transactions effected in any account over which you have no direct or indirect influence or control; or (C)	Shares of registered open-end investment companies. 2.	 Security Name . State the name of the issuer and the class of the Security, e.g., common stock, preferred stock or designated issue of debt securities, including the interest rate, principal amount and maturity date, if applicable. In the case of the acquisition or disposition of a futures contract, put, call option or other right, referred to as options, state the title of the Security subject to the option and the expiration date of the option. 3.	 Futures Transactions . Please remember that duplicates of all Confirmations, Purchase and Sale Reports, and month-end Statements must be sent to Adviser by your broker. Please double check to be sure this occurs if you report a future transaction. 4.	 Transaction Date . In the case of a market transaction, state the trade date, not the settlement date. 5.	Nature of Transaction (Buy or Sale) . State the character of the transaction, e.g., purchase or sale of Security, purchase or sale of option, or exercise of option. 6.	Amount of Security Involved (No. of Shares) . State the number of shares of stock, the face amount 

 III- 3 

Appendix III 
 of debt Securities or other units of other Securities. For options, state the amount of Securities subject to the option. If your ownership interest was through a spouse, relative or other natural person or through a partnership, trust, other entity, state the entire amount of Securities involved in the transaction. In such cases, you may also indicate, if you wish, the extent of your interest in the transaction. 7.	Purchase or Sale Price . State the purchase or sale price per share or other unit, exclusive of brokerage commissions or other costs of execution. In the case of an option, state the price at which it is currently exercisable. No price need be reported for transactions not involving cash. 8.	Broker, Dealer or Bank Effecting Transaction .

Examples of private investments may include equity in a business or company, a loan to a business or company, an investment in a hedge fund or limited partnership, or securities held in your home or in a safe deposit box. Examples of investments that generally are not considered private investments are your primary residence, vacation home, automobiles, artwork, jewelry, antiques, stamps, and coins. I do maintain private investments. I do not maintain private investments. If you indicated above that you do maintain private investments, please provide the information in the following table use additional paper if necessary ):

1 You will be considered to have a Beneficial Ownership Interest in an investment if you have a Pecuniary Interest in the investment. You will be considered to have a Pecuniary Interest in an investment if you, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, have the opportunity, directly or indirectly, to profit or share in any profit derived from a transaction in the investment. The term Pecuniary Interest is construed very broadly. The following examples illustrate this principle: (i) ordinarily, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all investments owned by members of your Immediate Family who share the same household with you; (ii) if you are a general partner of a general or limited partnership, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all investments held by the partnership; (iii) if you are a shareholder of a corporation or similar business entity, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all investments held by the corporation if you are a controlling shareholder or have or share investment control over the corporation s investment portfolio; (iv) if you have the right to acquire equity security through the exercise or conversion of a derivative investment, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in the investment, whether or not your right is presently exercisable; (v) if you are the sole member or a manager of a limited liability company, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in the investments held by the limited liability company; and (vi) ordinarily, if you are a trustee or beneficiary of a trust, where either you or members of your Immediate Family have a vested interest in the principal or income of the trust, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all investments held by that trust.

Appendix VII 
 INSIDER TRADING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES I.	BACKGROUND All personal securities trades are subject to these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures. However, compliance with the trading restrictions imposed by these procedures by no means assures full compliance with the prohibition on trading while in the possession of inside information, as defined in these procedures. Insider trading -- trading Securities while in possession of material, nonpublic information or improperly communicating such information to others -- may expose a person to stringent penalties. Criminal sanctions may include a fine of up to 1,000,000 and/or ten years imprisonment. The Commission may recover the profits gained, or losses avoided, through insider trading, obtain a penalty of up to three times the illicit gain or avoided loss, and/or issue an order permanently barring any person engaging in insider trading from the securities industry. In addition, investors may sue seeking to recover damages for insider trading violations. These Insider Trading Policies and Procedures are drafted broadly and will be applied and interpreted in a similar manner. Regardless of whether a federal inquiry occurs, SLR Capital views seriously any violation of these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures. Any violation constitutes grounds for disciplinary sanctions, including dismissal and/or referral to civil or governmental authorities for possible civil or criminal prosecution. The law of insider trading is complex; a Supervised Person legitimately may be uncertain about the application of these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures in a particular circumstance. A question could forestall disciplinary action or complex legal problems. Supervised Persons should direct any questions relating to these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures to a Compliance Officer. A Supervised Person must also notify a Compliance Officer immediately if he or she knows or has reason to believe that a violation of these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures has occurred or is about to occur. Any capitalized terms used but not defined in the Insider Trading Policies and Procedures shall have their respective meanings as defined in the Code of Ethics of SLR Capital. II.	STATEMENT OF FIRM POLICY A.	At all times, the interests of SLR Capital s Clients must prevail over the individual s interest. B.	Buying or selling Securities in the public markets on the basis of material, nonpublic information is prohibited. Similarly, buying and selling securities in a private transaction on the basis of material, nonpublic information is prohibited, except in the limited circumstance in which the information is obtained in connection with a private transaction with an issuer of securities, in which case the private transaction itself is permitted. A prohibited transaction would include purchasing or selling (i) for a Supervised Person s own account or one in which the Supervised Person has direct or indirect influence or control, (ii) for a Client s account, or (iii) for Adviser s inventory account. If any Supervised Person is uncertain as to whether information is material or nonpublic, he or she should consult the Chief Compliance Officer. E.	Disclosing material, nonpublic information to inappropriate personnel, whether or not for consideration, i.e., tipping, is prohibited. Material, nonpublic information must be disseminated on a need to know basis only to appropriate personnel. This would include any confidential discussions 

 VII- 1 

Appendix VII 
 between the issuer and personnel of Adviser. The Chief Compliance Officer should be consulted should a question arise as to who is privy to material, nonpublic information. F.	Assisting anyone transacting business on the basis of material, nonpublic information through a third party is prohibited. G.	In view of the Gabelli Co./GAMCO Investments, Inc. SEC proceeding, it is clear that when a portfolio manager is in a position, due to his official duties at an issuer, to have access to inside information on a relatively continuous basis, self-reporting procedures are not adequate to detect and prevent insider trading. Accordingly, neither Adviser nor an Adviser employee may trade in any securities issued by any company of which any Adviser employee is an employee or insider. All Supervised Persons must report to the Chief Compliance Officer or designee any affiliation or business relationship they may have with any issuer (a form of which is attached as Appendix A hereto.) H.	Supervised Persons should understand that if SLR Capital becomes aware of material, nonpublic information about the issuer of the underlying securities, even if the particular Supervised Person in question does not himself or herself have such knowledge, or enters into certain transactions for clients, SLR Capital will not bear any losses resulting in personal accounts through the implementation of these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures. I.	It is the Company s policy that Supervised Persons may purchase or sell Company securities only during the window period that generally begins on the second business day after the Company publicly releases quarterly or annual financial results and exten ds until the 15th day of the last calendar month of the quarter in which the results are announced (or such shorter or longer time that may be designated by the Chief Executive Officer of the BDC CEO or the Chief Operating Officer of the BDC COO and the CCO). However, the ability of a Supervised Person to engage in transactions in Company securities during window periods is not automatic or absolute. Circumstances may prevent or delay or accelerate the opening of the window period or cause the window period to be shortened or lengthened. Further, no trades may be made even during a window period by an individual who possesses material, nonpublic information, other than in accordance with a previously approved Trading Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Supervised Persons may also purchase or sell Company securities pursuant to a Trading Plan. As used herein, the term Trading Plan shall mean a pre arranged trading plan adopted in accordance with and meeting all of the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that has been approved by the Company s Chief Compliance Officer. A Trading Plan may only be entered into, modified or terminated (i) prior to expiration by Supervised Persons at a time they would otherwise be permitted to purchase or sell Company securities, and (ii) with the prior approval of the Company s Chief Compliance Officer. Each Supervised Person shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) with respect to any Trading Plan they may enter into, modify or terminate prior to expiration, notwithstanding the prior approval thereof by the Company s Chief Compliance Officer. In addition, the Adviser may, subject to regulatory restrictions, award Restricted Stock Units RSUs representing discretionary bonuses as part of an employee deferred compensation plan (the award during a closed window period provided that (1) the Adviser, the CEO and the COO are not in possession of material non-public information MNPI ); (2) the award does not require a purchase of Company securities on the open market but instead represents a transfer or potential transfer of Company securities then held by the Adviser; and (3) the CCO approves the award in advance. To the extent an award represents non-discretionary compensation, the RSUs may only be awarded in open window periods at a time when the Adviser, the CEO and the COO are not in possession of MNPI. 

 VII- 2 

Appendix VII 
 H.	 The following reviews principles important to these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures: 1.	What is Material Information? Information is material when there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making his or her investment decisions. Generally, information is material if its disclosure will have a substantial effect on the price of a company s Securities. No simple bright line test exists to determine whether information is material; assessments of materiality involve highly fact-specific inquiries. However, if the information you have received is or could be a factor in your trading decision, you must assume that the information is material. Supervised Persons should direct any questions regarding the materiality of information to the Chief Compliance Officer or designee. Material information often relates to a company s results and operations, including, for example, dividend changes, earnings results, changes in previously released earnings estimates, significant merger or acquisition proposals or agreements, major litigation, liquidation problems, and extraordinary management developments. Material information may also relate to the market for a Security. Information about a significant order to purchase or sell Securities, in some contexts, may be deemed material; similarly, prepublication information regarding reports in the financial press may also be deemed material. In addition, non-public information about one issuer may be material to a second issuer in the same or a related industry. 2.	What is Nonpublic Information? Information is nonpublic until it has been disseminated broadly to investors in the marketplace. Tangible evidence of this dissemination is the best indication that the information is public. For example, information is public after it has become available to the general public through a public filing with the Commission or some other government agency, or available to the Dow Jones tape or The Wall Street Journal or some other general circulation publication, and after sufficient time has passed so that the information has been disseminated widely. If you believe that you have information concerning an issuer which gives you an advantage over other investors, the information is, in all likelihood, non-public. 3.	Identifying Inside Information. Before executing any trade for oneself or others, including Clients, a Supervised Person must determine whether he or she has access to material, nonpublic information. If a Supervised Person believes he or she might have access to material, nonpublic information, he or she should: a.	Immediately alert the Chief Compliance Officer or designee, so that the applicable Security is placed on the Restricted List. b.	Not purchase or sell the Securities on his or her behalf or for others, including Clients (except in the limited circumstance in which the information is obtained in connection with a private transaction with an issuer of securities, in which case the private transaction itself is permitted). c.	Not communicate the information inside or outside of Adviser, other than to the Chief Compliance Officer or designee (or, in the limited circumstance of a private transaction with an issuer of securities, to Supervised Persons within Adviser involved in the transaction with a need to know the information). The Chief Compliance Officer will review the issue, determine whether the information is material 

 VII- 3 

Appendix VII 
 and nonpublic, and, if so, what action Adviser should take. 4.	Contacts With Public Companies. Contacts with public companies may represent part of Adviser s research efforts and Adviser may make investment decisions on the basis of its conclusions formed through these contacts and analysis of publicly available information. Difficult legal issues may arise, however, when a Supervised Person, in the course of these contacts, becomes aware of material, nonpublic information. For example, a company s Chief Financial Officer could prematurely disclose quarterly results, or an investor relations representative could make a selective disclosure of adverse news to certain investors. In these situations, Adviser must make a judgment about its further conduct. To protect oneself, Clients, and Adviser, a Supervised Person should immediately contact the Chief Compliance Officer if he or she believes he or she may have received material, nonpublic information. 5.	Tender Offers. Tender offers represent a particular concern in the law of insider trading for two reasons. First, tender offer activity often produces extraordinary movement in the price of the target company s securities. Trading during this time is more likely to attract regulatory attention, and produces a disproportionate percentage of insider trading cases. Second, the Commission has adopted a rule expressly forbidding trading and tipping while in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding a tender offer received from the company making the tender offer, the target company, or anyone acting on behalf of either. Supervised Persons must exercise particular caution any time they become aware of nonpublic information relating to a tender offer. III.	INSIDER TRADING PROCEDURES APPLICABLE TO ALL SUPERVISED PERSONS The following procedures have been established to aid Supervised Persons in avoiding insider trading, and to aid Adviser in preventing, detecting and imposing sanctions against insider trading. Every Supervised Person must follow these procedures or risk serious sanctions, including dismissal, substantial personal liability and criminal penalties. If a Supervised Person has any questions about these procedures, he or she should consult the Chief Compliance Officer or designee. A.	 Responsibilities of Supervised Persons. All Supervised Persons must make a diligent effort to ensure that a violation of these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures does not either intentionally or inadvertently occur. In this regard, all Supervised Persons (other than Disinterested Directors) are responsible for: (a)	Reading, understanding and consenting to comply with these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures. Supervised Persons will be required to sign an acknowledgment that they have read and understood the Compliance Manual and therefore their responsibilities under the Code; (b)	Ensuring that no trading occurs for their account, for any account over which they have direct or indirect influence or control or for any Client s account in Securities included on the Restricted List, or as to which they possess material, nonpublic information, regardless of the Securities being included on the Restricted List (except in the limited circumstance in which the information is obtained in connection with a private transaction with an issuer of securities, in which case the private transaction itself is permitted); (c)	Not disclosing inside information obtained from any source whatsoever to 

 VII- 4 

Appendix VII 
 inappropriate persons. Disclosure to family, friends or acquaintances will be grounds for immediate termination and/or referral to civil or governmental authorities for possible civil or criminal prosecution; (d)	Consulting the Chief Compliance Officer or designee when questions arise regarding insider trading or when potential violations of these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures are suspected; (e)	Ensuring that Adviser receives copies of confirmations and statements from both internal and external brokerage firms for accounts of Supervised Persons and members of the Immediate Family of such Supervised Persons sharing the same household; (f)	Advising the Chief Compliance Officer or designee of all outside business activities, directorships, or ownership of over 5 of the shares of a public company. No Supervised Person may engage in any outside business activities as employee, proprietor, partner, consultant, trustee officer or director without prior written consent of the Chief Compliance Officer, or a designee of the Chief Compliance Officer (a form of which is attached as Appendix A hereto); and (g)	Being aware of, and monitoring, any Clients who are shareholders, directors, and/or senior officers of public companies. Any unusual activity including a purchase or sale of restricted stock must be brought to the attention of the Chief Compliance Officer or designee. B.	 Security. In order to prevent accidental dissemination of material, nonpublic information, personnel must adhere to the following guidelines: Inform management when unauthorized personnel enter the premises. Lock doors at all times in areas that have confidential and secure files. Refrain from discussing sensitive information in public areas. Refrain from leaving confidential information on message devices. Maintain control of sensitive documents, including handouts and copies, intended for internal dissemination only. Ensure that faxes and e-mail messages containing sensitive information are properly sent, and confirm that the recipient has received the intended message. Do not allow passwords to be given to unauthorized personnel. IV.	SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES Supervisory procedures can be divided into two classifications prevention of insider trading and detection of insider trading. A.	 Prevention of Insider Trading To prevent insider trading, the Chief Compliance Officer or designee should: 1.	Maintain a Restricted List which includes the name of any company, whether or not a client of Adviser, as to which one or more individuals at Adviser has a fiduciary relationship or may have material information which has not been publicly disclosed. The Restricted List is maintained by the Chief Compliance Officer and his or her designees. The Chief Compliance Officer or such other Compliance Officer as may be designated shall be responsible for: (i) determining whether any particular 

 VII- 5 

Appendix VII 
 securities should be included on the Restricted List; (ii) determining when Securities should be removed from the Restricted List; and (iii) ensuring that Securities are timely added to and removed from the Restricted List, as appropriate, no less frequently than on a quarterly basis. 2.	Answer questions regarding SLR Capital s policies and procedures; 3.	Resolve issues of whether information received by an officer, director or employee of SLR Capital constitutes Inside Information and determine what action, if any, should be taken; 4.	Review these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures on a regular basis and update them as necessary; 5.	When it has been determined that a Supervised Person has Inside Information: (a)	Implement measures to prevent dissemination of such information other than to appropriate Supervised Persons on a need to know basis, and (b)	Not permit any SLR Capital employee to execute any transaction in any securities of the issuer in question by rejecting any pre-clearance requests (except in the limited circumstance in which the information is obtained in connection with a private transaction with an issuer of securities, in which case the private transaction itself is permitted); 1.	Implement a program of periodic reminder notices regarding insider trading; 2.	Confirm with each trader no less frequently than quarterly whether there are any issuers for whom Adviser has Inside Information; and 3.	Compile and maintain the Restricted List of securities in which no Supervised Person may trade because Adviser as an entity is deemed to have Inside Information concerning the issuers of such securities and determine when to remove securities from the Restricted List. B.	 Detection of Insider Trading To detect insider trading, the Chief Compliance Officer or designee should: 1.	Review daily confirmations and quarterly trading activity reports filed by Supervised Persons; and 2.	Promptly investigate all reports of any possible violations of these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures. C.	Special Reports to Management Promptly upon learning of a potential violation of SLR Capital s Insider Trading Policies and Procedures, the Chief Compliance Officer or designee shall prepare a written report to management providing full details, which may include (1) the name of particular securities involved, if any, (2) the date(s) SLR Capital learned of the potential violation and began investigating; (3) the accounts and individuals involved; (4) actions taken as a result of the investigation, if any; and (5) recommendations for further action. 

 VII- 6 

Appendix VII 
 D.	General Reports to Management At least yearly, the Chief Compliance Officer will prepare a written report to the management of Adviser setting forth some or all of the following: 1.	A summary of existing procedures to detect and prevent insider trading; 2.	A summary of changes in procedures made in the last year; 3.	Full details of any investigation, whether internal or by a regulatory agency, since the last report, regarding any suspected insider trading, the results of the investigation and a description of any changes in procedures promptly by any such investigation; and 4.	An evaluation of the current procedures and a description of anticipated changes in procedures.
