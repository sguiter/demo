Forward-looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements which reflect current views of PCB Bancorp (collectively, with its consolidated subsidiary, the Company, we, us or our with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as may, might, should, could, predict, potential, believe, expect, continue, will, anticipate, seek, estimate, intend, plan, projection, goal, target, aim, would, and annualized and outlook, or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and industry, management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 A number of important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, but are not limited to, the following: 
 business and economic conditions, particularly those affecting the financial services industry and our primary market areas and arising from recent inflationary pressures and governmental and societal responses thereto; 
 our ability to successfully manage our credit risk and the sufficiency of our allowance for credit loss; 
 factors that can impact the performance of our loan portfolio, including real estate values and liquidity in our primary market areas, the financial health of our commercial borrowers and the success of construction projects that we finance; 
 governmental monetary and fiscal policies, and changes in market interest rates; 
 the current inflationary environment and government and regulatory responses thereto; 
 adverse developments at other banks, including bank failures, that impact general sentiment regarding the stability and liquidity of banks and may affect our customers behavior and our stock price; 
 the significant portion of our loan portfolio that is comprised of real estate loans; 
 our ability to attract and retain Korean-American customers; 
 our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks, fraud and systems errors; 
 our ability to effectively execute our strategic plan and manage our growth; 
 changes in our senior management team and our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel; 
 cyber-attacks, ransomware attacks, computer viruses or other malware that may breach the security of our websites or other systems to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage our systems; 
 liquidity issues, including fluctuations in the fair value and liquidity of the securities we hold and our ability to raise additional capital, if necessary; 
 costs and obligations associated with operating as a public company; 
 effects of competition from a wide variety of local, regional, national and other providers of financial, investment and insurance services; 
 the effects of severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) and other external events on our business; 
 the impact of any claims or legal actions to which we may be subject, including any effect on our reputation, and the availability of insurance coverage for such claims and actions; and 
 changes in federal tax laws or policies. 
 The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements and the risks described under Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our other documents that we file with the United States U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Because of these risks and other uncertainties, our actual future results, performance or achievement, or industry results, may be materially different from the results indicated by the forward looking statements in this report. In addition, our past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future results. You should not rely on any forward looking statements, which represent our beliefs, assumptions and estimates only as of the dates on which they were made, as predictions of future events. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is initially made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, pledged securities were million and million, respectively. These securities were pledged for the State Deposit from the California State Treasurer. 
 The Company elected to exclude accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost of its securities available-for-sale. Accrued interest receivable on securities available-for-sale totaled thousand and thousand at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no holdings of securities available-for-sale of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government agency and U.S. government sponsored enterprise, in an amount greater than 10 of shareholder s equity.

 , at amortized cost basis, of the Company's securities available-for-sale were issued by U.S. government agency and U.S. government sponsored enterprise. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates, and not credit quality, and because the Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery, the Company determined that these securities with unrealized losses did not warrant an ACL. 
 Municipal and corporate bonds had an investment grade rating upon purchase. The issuers of these securities have not established any cause for default on these securities and various rating agencies have reaffirmed their long-term investment grade status as of September 30, 2024. These securities have fluctuated in value since their purchase dates as market interest rates fluctuated. Additionally, the Company continues to receive contractual principal and interest payments in a timely manner. The Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company therefore determined that the investment securities with unrealized losses did not warrant an ACL as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded ACL on securities available-for-sale.

 quantitatively measured loss reserve requirement, as well as, an ACL increase on commercial and industrial loans related to qualitative adjustment factors from the increase of past due loans. ACL on commercial property loans decreased primarily due to a decrease in reserve related to qualitative adjustment factors from the improvement in the credit metrics.

 Loans held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. When a determination is made at the time of commitment to originate as held-for-investment, it is the Company s intent to hold these loans to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to periodic reviews under the Company s management evaluation processes, including asset/liability management and credit risk management. When the Company subsequently changes its intent to hold certain loans, the loans are transferred to held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value. Certain loans are transferred to held-for-sale with write-downs to ACL on loans.

 Unfunded loan commitments are generally made for periods of days or less, except for SBA loans that are generally made for periods of days or less. 
 The Company applies an expected credit loss estimation methodology applied to each respective loan segment for determining the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures. The loss estimation process includes assumptions for utilization at default. These assumptions are based on the Company s own historical internal loan data. As a part of adoption of ASC 326, the Company recorded an initial adjustment to the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures of million on January 1, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company maintained an ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures of million and million in Accrued Interest Payable and Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each client s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Company is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. 
 Litigation 
 The Company is involved in various matters of litigation, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the disposition of pending matters of litigation will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 Network and Data Incident 
 On August 30, 2021, the Bank identified unusual activity on its network. The Bank responded promptly to disable the activity, investigate its source and monitor the Bank s network. The Bank subsequently became aware of claims that it had been the target of a ransomware attack. On September 7, 2021, the Bank determined that an external actor had illegally accessed and/or acquired certain data on its network. The Bank worked with third-party forensic investigators to understand the nature and scope of the incident and determine what information may have been accessed and/or acquired and who may have been impacted. The investigation revealed that this incident impacted certain files containing certain Bank customer information. Some of these files contained documents related to loan applications, such as tax returns, Form W-2 information of their employees, and payroll records. The Bank has notified all individuals identified as impacted, consistent with applicable laws. All impacted individuals were offered free Equifax Complete Premier credit monitoring and identify theft protection services. The Bank has notified law enforcement and appropriate authorities of the incident. 
 On December 16, 2021, a complaint based on the incident was filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court seeking damages, injunctive relief, and equitable relief. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Bank agreed to settle this matter in exchange for thousand to the putative class members, including costs of settlement administration, and attorneys fees and costs. The Bank received preliminary court approval of the settlement and notice was provided to members of the proposed class during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The court issued an order granting final approval on June 20, 2024.

 The California Financial Code provides that a bank generally may not make a cash distribution to its shareholders in excess of the lesser of the bank s undivided profits or the bank s net income for its last three fiscal years less the amount of any distribution made to the bank s shareholders during the same period. This law limits the distributions the Bank is permitted to make to the Company. As a California corporation, the Company is subject to the limitations of the California Corporations Code, which allows a corporation to distribute cash or property to shareholders, including a dividend or repurchase or redemption of shares, if the corporation meets either a retained earnings test or a balance sheet test. Under the retained earnings test, the Company may make a distribution from retained earnings to the extent that its retained earnings exceed the sum of (a) the amount of the distribution plus (b) the amount, if any, of dividends in arrears on shares with preferential dividend rights. Under the balance sheet test, the Company may also make a distribution if, immediately after the distribution, the value of its assets equals or exceeds the sum of (a) its total liabilities plus (b) the liquidation preference of any shares which have a preference upon dissolution over the rights of shareholders receiving the distribution. Indebtedness is not considered a liability if the terms of such indebtedness provide that payment of principal and interest thereon are to be made only if, and to the extent that, a distribution to shareholders could be made under the balance sheet test.

Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following is management s discussion and analysis of the major factors that influenced the Company s results of operations and financial condition as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes (unaudited) thereto set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and general practices within the banking industry. Within these financial statements, certain financial information contains approximate measurements of financial effects of transactions and impacts at the consolidated statements of financial condition dates and the Company s results of operations for the reporting periods. As certain accounting policies require significant estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities, the Company has established critical accounting policies to facilitate making the judgment necessary to prepare financial statements. The Company s critical accounting policies are described in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) included in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) Instruments . The adoption of ASC 326 changes the way the Company estimates the ACL on certain financial assets. The adoption of ASC 326 requires the Company to measure and record current expected credit losses for financial assets within the scope of ASC 326, which the Company currently consist substantially of loans, off-balance sheet credit exposures and securities available-for-sale. Measuring credit losses under the current expected credit losses CECL framework requires a significant amount of judgment, including the incorporation of reasonable and supportable forecasts about future conditions that may ultimately impact the level of credit losses the Company may recognize. Under the CECL framework, current expected credit losses are recorded on financial assets within the scope of ASC 326 at the time of their origination or acquisition. 
 Estimating expected credit losses requires management to use relevant forward-looking information, including the use of reasonable and supportable forecasts. The measurement of the ACL is performed by collectively evaluating loans with similar risk characteristics. The Company s discounted cash flow methodology incorporates a probability of default and loss given default model, as well as expectations of future economic conditions, using reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
 The use of reasonable and supportable forecasts requires significant judgment, such as selecting forecast scenarios, as well as determining the appropriate length of the forecast horizon. Management leverages economic projections from a reputable and independent third party to inform and provide its reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Although no one economic variable can fully demonstrate the sensitivity of the ACL estimate to changes in economic variables used in the ACL model, the Company utilized changes in U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year change in real gross domestic product GDP growth rate as its key economic variables. Other internal and external indicators of economic forecasts may also be considered by management when developing the forecast metrics. The Company s ACL model reverts to long-term average loss rates for purposes of estimating expected cash flows beyond a period deemed reasonable and supportable. The Company forecasts economic conditions and expected credit losses over a one-year time horizon. Beyond the one-year forecast time horizon, the Company s ACL model reverts to historical long-term average loss rates over a one-year period. 
 Within the various economic scenarios considered as of September 30, 2024, the quantitative estimate of the ACL would increase by approximately 8.4 million under sole consideration of a more adverse downside scenario. The quoted sensitivity calculation reflects the sensitivity of the modeled ACL estimate to macroeconomic forecast data, but is absent of qualitative overlays and other qualitative adjustments that are part of the quarterly reserving process and does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ACL for reasons including increases or decreases in qualitative adjustments, changes in the risk profile and size of the portfolio, changes in the severity of the macroeconomic scenario and the range of scenarios under management consideration. 
 
 41 

A portion of the collectively evaluated ACL on loans also includes qualitative adjustments for risk factors not reflected or captured by the quantitative modeled ACL but are relevant in estimating future expected credit losses. Qualitative adjustments may be related to and include, but not limited to factors such as: (i) management s assessment of economic forecasts used in the model and how those forecasts align with management s overall evaluation of current and expected economic conditions, (ii) organization-specific risks such as credit concentrations, collateral specific risks, regulatory risks, and external factors that may ultimately impact credit quality, (iii) potential model limitations such as limitations identified through back-testing, and other limitations associated with factors such as underwriting changes, acquisition of new portfolios and changes in portfolio segmentation, and (iv) management s overall assessment of the adequacy of the ACL, including an assessment of ACL model data inputs. 
 Although management uses the best information reasonably available to derive estimates and assumptions necessary to measure an appropriate level of the ACL, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change in future periods, which may have a material impact on the level of the ACL and the Company s results of operations. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company s operational performance and to enhance investors overall understanding of such financial performance. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated, and presented in accordance with GAAP. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that may be presented by other companies. 
 The following tables present reconciliation of return on average tangible common equity, tangible common equity per common share and tangible common equity to tangible assets ratios to their most comparable GAAP measures as of the dates or for the periods indicated. These non-GAAP measures, which are presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, are used by management in its analysis of the Company's performance.

 Results of Operations 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 A principal component of the Company s earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest earning assets is referred to as the net interest margin. The net interest spread is the yield on average interest earning assets less the cost of average interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by changes in the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities.

 Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to salaries, bonus accrual, incentives tied to sales of SBA loans originated at LPOs, and other employee benefits, partially offset by a decrease in vacation accrual. The number of full-time equivalent employees was 264 at September 30, 2024 compared to 270 at September 30, 2023. 
 Occupancy and equipment increased primarily due to an expansion of headquarters location in the second half of 2023, and the relocation of a regional office and the consolidation of two branches into a new location in Orange County, California starting from the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Professional fees decreased primarily due to the completion a core system conversion that was completed in April 2024, resulting in high professional fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Marketing and business promotion expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in advertisements. 
 Regulatory assessments increased primarily due to an increase in the balance sheet. 
 Other expenses included 315 thousand and 311 thousand in loan related expenses, 1.7 million and 1.6 million in office expense, and 635 thousand and 588 thousand in armed guard expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company recognized a termination charge for the legacy core system of 508 thousand and an expense of 815 thousand for a reimbursement for an SBA loan guarantee previously paid by the SBA on a loan originated in 2014 that subsequently defaulted and was ultimately determined to be ineligible for the SBA guaranty during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense was 2.9 million and 3.0 million, respectively, and the effective tax rate was 26.9 and 29.7 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, income tax expense was 7.2 million and 10.2 million, respectively, and the effective tax rate was 27.7 and 29.2 , respectively.

Financial Condition 
 
 Investment Securities 
 
 The Company s investment strategy aims to maximize earnings while maintaining liquidity in securities with minimal credit risk. The types and maturities of securities purchased are primarily based on current and projected liquidity and interest rate sensitivity positions.

 Total investment securities were 147.6 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.3 million, or 3.0 , from 143.3 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to purchases of 14.8 million and an increase in fair value of securities available-for-sale of 3.5 million, partially offset by principal paydowns of 13.9 million and net premium amortization of 123 thousand. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 95.3 , at amortized cost basis, of the Company's securities available-for-sale were issued by U.S. government agency and U.S. government sponsored enterprise. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates, and not credit quality, and because the Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery, the Company determined that these securities with unrealized losses did not warrant an ACL. 
 Municipal and corporate bonds had an investment grade rating upon purchase. The issuers of these securities have not established any cause for default on these securities and various rating agencies have reaffirmed their long-term investment grade status as of September 30, 2024. These securities have fluctuated in value since their purchase dates as market interest rates fluctuated. Additionally, the Company continues to receive contractual principal and interest payments in a timely manner. The Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company determined that the investment securities with unrealized losses did not warrant an ACL as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded no ACL on securities available-for-sale.

 Loans Held-For-Sale 
 Loans held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. When a determination is made at the time of commitment to originate as held-for-investment, it is the Company s intent to hold these loans to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to periodic reviews under the Company s management evaluation processes, including asset/liability management and credit risk management. When the Company subsequently changes its intent to hold certain loans, the loans are transferred to held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value. Certain loans are transferred to held-for-sale with write-downs to allowance for credit losses on loans. 
 Loans held-for-sale were 5.2 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 15 thousand, or 0.3 , from 5.2 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to new funding of 48.3 million and a loan transferred from loan held-for-investment of 676 thousand, partially offset by sales of 47.2 million and pay-offs and pay-downs of 1.8 million.

 Loans held-for-investment were 2.47 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 142.7 million, or 6.1 , from 2.32 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to new funding and advances of 1.83 billion, partially offset by paydowns and payoffs of 1.69 billion.

 The increase in ACL for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in loans held-for-investment and quantitatively measured loss reserve requirement, partially offset by a decrease in reserve related to qualitative adjustment factors. The increase in the quantitatively measured loss reserve requirement was primarily due to the increased unemployment rate forecasts by the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC ). The projected 2024 and 2025 year-end national unemployment rate increased to 4.4 and 4.4 , respectively, in the September 2024 meeting from 4.0 and 4.2 , respectively, in the June 2024 meetings, which resulted an increase in probability of default PD rates for the 4-quarter projected period. The projected 2024 year-end year-over-year change in real GDP decreased to 2.0 in the September 2024 meeting from 2.1 in the June 2024 meetings. The projected 2025 year-end year-over-year change in real GDP was maintained at 2.0 at both meetings. Management believes that the projections used are reasonable and aligns with the Company s expectation of the economic environment over the next 4 quarters.

 The increase in nonaccrual loans held-for-investment was primarily due to loans placed on nonaccrual status of 6.6 million, partially offset by paydowns and payoffs of 1.6 million, loans returned to accrual status of 2.0 million, charge-offs of 126 thousand, and a loan transferred to OREO of 94 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due, unless management believes the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Past due loans may or may not be adequately collateralized, but collection efforts are continuously pursued. Loans may be restructured by management when a borrower experiences changes to their financial condition, causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms, and where management believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full. Additional income of approximately 171 thousand and 432 thousand would have been recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, had these loans been paid in accordance with their original terms throughout the periods indicated.

Deposits 
 The Bank gathers deposits primarily through its branch locations. The Bank offers a variety of deposit products including demand deposits accounts, NOW and money market accounts, savings accounts and time deposits.

 The decrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits was primarily due to strong deposit market competition and the migration of noninterest-bearing demand deposits to interest-bearing deposits. To retain existing and attract new customers, the Bank offers competitive rates on deposit products. 
 The increase in retail time deposits was primarily due to new accounts of 272.7 million and renewals of the matured accounts of 560.4 million, partially offset by matured and closed accounts of 760.8 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total deposits were comprised of 22.0 and 25.3 , respectively, of noninterest-bearing demand accounts, 20.0 and 17.9 , respectively, of savings, NOW and money market accounts, and 58.0 and 56.8 , respectively, of time deposits. 
 Deposits from certain officers, directors and their related interests with which they are associated held by the Company were 3.3 million and 3.7 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Shareholders Equity and Regulatory Capital 
 Capital Resources 
 Shareholders equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends paid on common stock and preferred stock, sales and redemptions of common stock and preferred stock, and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income caused primarily by fluctuations in unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, on securities available-for-sale. 
 Shareholders equity was 362.3 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 13.4 million, or 3.8 , from 348.9 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to net income of 18.8 million and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 2.5 million, partially offset by dividends declared on common stock of 7.7 million, repurchases of common stock of 222 thousand and preferred stock dividends of 488 thousand. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking regulators. The Company is not currently subject to separate minimum capital requirements under the Federal Reserve s Small Bank Holding Company policy. At such time as the Company reaches the 3 billion asset level, it will be subject to consolidated capital requirements independent of the Bank. 
 Failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for the prompt corrective action PCA ), the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies. In addition to these uniform risk-based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry, the regulators have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios. 
 The following table presents a summary of the capital requirements applicable to the Bank in order to be considered well-capitalized from a regulatory perspective, as well as the Bank s capital ratios as of the dates indicated. For comparison purpose, the Company s ratios are included as well, all of which would have exceeded the well-capitalized level under PCA had the Company been subject to separate capital minimums.

 15.16 14.85 6.0 8.0 Tier 1 capital (to average assets) 
 13.43 13.16 4.0 5.0 
 To avoid restrictions on dividends, share repurchases and discretionary compensation payments to executives, the federal banking agencies require a banking organization to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.50 in common tier 1 capital, in addition to the minimum capital ratios necessary to minimum regulatory requirements. The capital conservation buffer increases the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7 , the minimum Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) ratio to 8.5 and the minimum total capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) to 10.5 for banking organizations seeking to avoid the limitations on dividends, share repurchases and discretionary compensation payments to executives. The Company s and the Bank s capital conservation buffer were 7.42 and 7.54 , respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and 7.73 and 8.07 , respectively, as of December 31, 2023.

Emergency Capital Investment Program 
 On May 24, 2022, the Company issued 69,141 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for the capital investment of 69.1 million from the U.S. Treasury under the ECIP. The ECIP investment qualifies as tier 1 capital for purposes of the bank regulatory capital requirements. 
 The Series C Preferred Stock accrued no dividend for the first 24 months following the investment date. Beginning on May 24, 2024, holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to quarterly non-cumulative cash dividends as declared by the Company s Board of Directors. The Series C Preferred Stock dividend rate adjusts annually based on the lending growth criteria listed in the terms of the ECIP investment with the annual dividend rate up to 2 . After the tenth anniversary of the investment date, the dividend rate will be fixed based on average annual amount of lending in years 2 through 10. Dividends will be payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15. The terms of the Series C Preferred Stock prohibit the Company from paying dividends on or repurchasing shares of its common stock unless it has paid or contemporaneously pays the full Series C Preferred Stock dividend with respect to the preceding quarterly dividend period. 
 The Series C Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company on or after the fifth anniversary of issuance (or earlier in the event of loss of regulatory capital treatment), subject to the approval of the appropriate federal banking regulator and in accordance with the federal banking agencies regulatory capital regulations. 
 Established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, the ECIP was created to encourage low- and moderate-income community financial institutions and minority depository institutions to provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers, especially low-income and underserved communities, including persistent poverty counties, that may be disproportionately impacted by the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing direct and indirect capital investments in low- and moderate-income community financial institutions. 
 The Company began paying quarterly dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock at 2 beginning in the three months ended June 30, 2024. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock totaled 346 thousand and 488 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Stock Repurchases 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased and retired 512,657 shares of common stock at a weighted-average price of 17.22 per share under a stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors on August 2, 2023 and a legacy stock repurchase program approved on July 28, 2022. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased and retired 14,947 shares of common stock at a weighted-average price of 14.88 per share. On July 25, 2024, the Company announced the amendment of the 2023 stock repurchase program, which extended the program expiration from August 2, 2024 to August 1, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was authorized to purchase 577,777 additional shares under the 2023 stock repurchase program.

Liquidity 
 Liquidity refers to the measure of ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting operating cash flow and capital and strategic cash flow needs, all at a reasonable cost. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of the Company s shareholders. 
 The Company s liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions, federal funds sold, and unpledged securities available-for-sale. Liquid liabilities may include core deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other borrowings. Other sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market non-core deposits, additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances and Federal Reserve Discount Window, and the issuance of debt securities and preferred or common securities. 
 The Company s short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily to fund on-going operations, including payment of interest on deposits and debt, extensions of credit to borrowers, capital expenditures and shareholder dividends. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in loan and investment securities portfolios, increases in debt financing and other borrowings, and increases in customer deposits. 
 Integral to the Company s liquidity management is the administration of borrowings. To the extent the Company is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits, the Company seeks to meet its liquidity needs through wholesale funding or other borrowings on either a short or long-term basis. 
 The following table presents a summary of the Company s liquidity position as of the dates indicated: 
 in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amount Change Percentage Change Cash and cash equivalents 193,064 242,342 (49,278) (20.3) Cash and cash equivalents to total assets 6.7 8.7 Available borrowing capacity: FHLB advances 702,986 602,976 100,010 16.6 Federal Reserve Discount Window 578,713 528,893 49,820 9.4 Overnight federal funds lines 65,000 65,000 Total 1,346,699 1,196,869 149,830 12.5 Total available borrowing capacity to total assets 46.6 42.9 
 The Company also maintains relationships in the capital markets with brokers and dealers to issue time deposits and money market accounts. 
 PCB Bancorp, on a stand-alone holding company basis, must provide for its own liquidity and its main source of funding is dividends from the Bank. There are statutory, regulatory and debt covenant limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the holding company. Management believes that these limitations will not impact the Company s ability to meet its ongoing short- and long-term cash obligations.

Off-Balance Credit Exposures and Contractual Obligations 
 Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures 
 The Company has limited off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into financial commitments to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial commitments include commitments to extend credit, unused lines of credit, commercial and similar letters of credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk not recognized in the Company s financial statements. 
 The Company s exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance on these financial commitments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for loans reflected in the consolidated financial statements. 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each client s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. The following table presents outstanding financial commitments whose contractual amount represents credit risk as of the dates indicated: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 in thousands) Fixed Rate Variable Rate Fixed Rate Variable Rate Unused lines of credit 11,828 381,302 2,808 347,652 Unfunded loan commitments 5,590 34,839 4,020 47,038 Standby letters of credit

 Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. Management expects to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. The Company has in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs.

Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities. Market risk occurs in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, equity prices, and credit spreads. 
 Overview 
 Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (repricing risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers ability to prepay residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a nonparallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR (basis risk). 
 The Company s Board Asset Liability Committee ALCO establishes broad policy limits with respect to interest rate risk. Board ALCO establishes specific operating guidelines within the parameters of the Board of Directors policies. In general, the Company seeks to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the economic values of assets and liabilities. Board ALCO meets quarterly to monitor the level of interest rate risk sensitivity to ensure compliance with the Board of Directors approved risk limits. The Company also has a Management ALCO, which is comprised of the senior management team and the Chief Executive Officer, to proactively monitor interest rate risk. 
 Interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk posture given business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations, and policy constraints. 
 An asset sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate higher net interest income, as rates earned on interest-earning assets would reprice upward more quickly than rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, thus expanding net interest margin. Conversely, a liability sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate lower net interest income, as rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities would reprice upward more quickly than rates earned on interest-earning assets, thus compressing net interest margin. 
 Measurement 
 Interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools, which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios. Interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the Board ALCO at least quarterly. The information reported includes period-end results and identifies any policy limits exceeded, along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution, mitigation, or assumption of the risk. 
 The Company uses two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net Interest Income at Risk NII at Risk ), and Economic Value of Equity EVE ). Under NII at Risk, net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets, liabilities, and derivatives. The Company uses a static balance sheet to perform these analyses. EVE measures the period end market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change. EVE simulation reflects the effect of interest rate shifts on the value of the Company. In contrast to NII simulation, EVE simulation identifies risks arising from repricing or maturity gaps over the life of the balance sheet. The EVE approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the NII at Risk approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows. 
 Simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions. To the extent the actual behavior is different from the assumption used in the models, there could be material changes in results. The assumptions applied in the model are documented, supported, and periodically back-tested to assess the reasonableness and effectiveness. The Company makes appropriate changes to the model as needed and these changes are reviewed by Board and Management ALCOs. The Company also continuously validates the model, methodology and results. Scenario results do not reflect strategies that the management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations. 
 As part of the Company s continuous evaluation and periodic enhancements to its NII and EVE calculations. The model incorporates deposit repricing assumptions impacting both consumer and wholesale deposits, deposit behavior assumption related to its non-maturity deposits, and prepayment assumptions related to its loan portfolio. The model modifications incorporated observed pricing and customer behavior in both rising and falling interest rate environments. The model is updated annually and was last evaluated during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 64 

The following table presents the projected changes in NII at Risk and EVE that would occur upon an immediate change in interest rates based on independent analysis as of the dates indicated, but without giving effect to any steps that management might take to counteract changes: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Simulated Rate Changes Net Interest Income Sensitivity Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Net Interest Income Sensitivity Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity +200 
 5.7 (3.0) 7.0 (6.8) +100 
 2.9 (1.2) 3.6 (3.1) -100 
 (4.3) (1.4) (4.3) 1.8 -200 (9.2) (5.5) (9.4) 
 On September 18, 2024, the FOMC lowered the upper range of the Fed Funds Target Rate from 5.5 to 5.0 . In the accompanying statement, they added, The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 , and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The Committee added that they remain attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate, and will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook and balance of risks. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s net interest income sensitivity results exhibit an asset sensitive profile. Net interest income is expected to increase when interest rates rise, as the Company has a large proportion of variable rate loans in its loan portfolio, primarily linked to Prime Rate indices, that are sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. The Company s deposit portfolio is also sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates, even though a large portion of its deposit mix is composed of non-maturity deposits that are not directly tied to short-term interest rate indices. The modeled results are highly sensitive to reinvestment yield and deposit beta assumptions. Actual results in net interest income during a period of rising interest rates may vary from the Company s net interest income sensitivity results, as the actual result reflects earnings asset growth and deposit mix changes based on customer preferences relative to the interest rate environment. 
 The Company s EVE sensitivity reflects a slight liability sensitive profile due to the continuing deposit mix shift from non-maturity deposits to time deposits. The model result is highly sensitive to deposit behaviors as well as loan prepayment assumptions. Due to the uncertainty of the current economic forecast, and timing and direction of future interest rate movements, actual result may vary from the Company s EVE sensitivity results. 
 
 Item 4 - Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Act ), as of September 30, 2024 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other members of the Company s senior management. The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act is: (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1 - Legal Proceedings 
 In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various legal claims. Management has reviewed all legal claims against the Company with counsel and have taken into consideration the views of such counsel as to the potential outcome of the claims in determining the accrued loss contingency. The Company did not have any accrued loss contingencies for legal claims at September 30, 2024. It is reasonably possible the Company may incur losses in addition to the amounts currently accrued. However, at this time, the Company is unable to estimate the range of additional losses that are reasonably possible because of a number of factors, including the fact that certain of these litigation matters are still in their early stages and involve claims for which, at this point, the Company believes have little to no merit. Management has considered these and other possible loss contingencies and does not expect the amounts to be material to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Network and Data Incident 
 On August 30, 2021, the Bank identified unusual activity on its network. The Bank responded promptly to disable the activity, investigate its source and monitor the Bank s network. The Bank subsequently became aware of claims that it had been the target of a ransomware attack. On September 7, 2021, the Bank determined that an external actor had illegally accessed and/or acquired certain data on its network. The Bank worked with third-party forensic investigators to understand the nature and scope of the incident and determine what information may have been accessed and/or acquired and who may have been impacted. The investigation revealed that this incident impacted certain files containing certain Bank customer information. Some of these files contained documents related to loan applications, such as tax returns, Form W-2 information of their employees, and payroll records. The Bank has notified all individuals identified as impacted, consistent with applicable laws. All impacted individuals were offered free Equifax Complete Premier credit monitoring and identify theft protection services. The Bank has notified law enforcement and appropriate authorities of the incident. 
 On December 16, 2021, Plaintiff Min Woo Bae, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court a complaint based on the incident for damages, injunctive relief, and equitable relief, styled Min Woo Bae v. Pacific City Bank , Case Number 21STCV45922 the Matter ). During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Bank agreed to settle this matter in exchange for 700 thousand to the putative class members, including costs of settlement administration, and attorneys fees and costs. The Bank received preliminary court approval of the settlement and notice was provided to members of the proposed class during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The court issued an order granting final approval on June 20, 2024. 
 The Company expects that the full amount of the final settlement will be covered under the Company s applicable insurance policies. 
 
 Item 1A - Risk Factors 
 Management is not aware of any material changes to the risk factors that appeared under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part 1, Item 1A, of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. The risks described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management or that management presently believes not to be material may also result in material and adverse effects on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
