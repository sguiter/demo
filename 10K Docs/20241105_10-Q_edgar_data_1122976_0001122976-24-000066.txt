 On April 9, 2024, the Company refinanced its senior secured term loan by amending the credit agreement governing such term loan (the "Term Loan Amendment"). The amendment reduced the interest rates per annum by basis points, which now are either (i) Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Term Loan Amendment) plus , or (ii) a Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Amendment) plus . The maturity date and other terms and conditions are substantially the same as the terms and conditions under the credit agreement immediately prior to the Term Loan Amendment. 
 On September 19, 2024, the Company completed the issuance of million in Senior Notes which will mature on November 1, 2031 (the "2031 Notes"). The Company received proceeds of million, net of financing costs, related to the issuance. Interest on the 2031 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on May 1, 2025. The 2031 Notes were sold in a private offering and are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. 
 Proceeds from the 2031 Notes and cash on hand were used to fully redeem the million outstanding of the Company's Senior Notes due May 15, 2025. The notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount. Included within Interest expense, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income is a charge of million related to the write-off of unamortized issuances costs and discounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had borrowings outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility due 2026 (the Revolving Credit Facility), which had remaining availability of million. 
 The agreements governing our Revolving Credit Facility and our senior secured term loan, and the indentures and credit agreements governing other debt, contain a number of customary financial and restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: sell or otherwise transfer assets, including in a spin-off, incur additional debt or liens, consolidate or merge with any entity or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our assets, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, make investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, create dividend or other payment restrictions with respect to subsidiaries, make capital investments and alter the business we conduct.

 million maturing in May 2025 and million maturing in August 2027. We designated the cross currency swaps as net investment hedges of our net investment in our European operations under ASU 2017-12 and applied the spot method to these hedges. The changes in fair value of the derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recognized within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) to offset the changes in the values of the net investment being hedged. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, losses of million and million were recognized within translation adjustments in AOCI, net of tax, respectively, compared to a gain of million and loss of million, net of tax, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Included within Interest expense, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income are benefits of million and million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, associated with the cross currency swaps. 
 All of our derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. We determine the fair value of our derivatives based on valuation methods, which project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market based observable inputs, including interest rate curves and foreign currency rates.

companies signed the agreed Consent Decree and remedial action Work Plan, which received Federal Court approval in January 2021. 
 In the third quarter of 2023, utilizing a preliminary design, the Company received construction bids for the largest component of the remedial action at Calvert City involving the construction of a barrier wall around the site. The accrual was updated to align with the selected bid costs in the third quarter of 2023, which resulted in a charge of million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the second quarter of 2024, we completed the design for one phase of the barrier wall, and updated the remedial action timeline. These changes resulted in charges of million in the second quarter of 2024. Construction of the initial wall section began in the third quarter of 2024 and is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2024. The remaining portions of the wall design and construction are expected to be completed in phases between 2025 and 2028. As of September 30, 2024, we had accrued million for this matter. 
 Total environmental accruals of million and million are reflected within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These undiscounted accruals represent our best estimate of probable future costs that we can reasonably estimate, based upon currently available information and how the remedy will be implemented. It is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs in excess of the amount accrued, which could be material to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income . However, such additional costs cannot be currently estimated as they are dependent upon the results of future testing and findings during the execution of remedial design and remedial action, changes in the Calvert City construction timeline, changes in regulations, technology development, new information, newly discovered conditions and other factors that are not currently known. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Avient recognized costs of million and million, respectively, primarily associated with the ongoing remedial design and remedial action at Calvert City, compared to costs of million and million recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. These costs are recognized in Cost of Sales within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income . 
 Avient is subject to a broad range of claims, administrative and legal proceedings such as lawsuits that relate to contractual allegations, tax audits, product claims, personal injuries, and employment related matters. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome or cost of these matters, the Company believes our current reserves are appropriate and these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements.

 Sales 
 Sales increased 61.5 million, or 8.2 , and 70.1 million, or 2.9 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by increased demand. Demand increases were driven by the consumer, packaging, healthcare, defense and building and construction end markets, partially offset by weakness in the transportation and telecommunications end markets. There were unfavorable foreign currency impacts of 0.4 and 0.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 13 AVIENT CORPORATION 

Gross Margin 
 Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 32.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 25.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The gross margin improvement was driven primarily by the benefit from raw material deflation, mix improvement, lower environmental remediation costs of 35.7 million and lower restructuring charges of 3.9 million. 
 Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 32.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 28.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gross margin improvement was driven primarily by the benefit from raw material deflation, mix improvement, lower environmental remediation costs of 24.3 million and lower restructuring charges of 15.5 million. 
 Selling and administrative expense 
 Selling and administrative expense increased 23.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by higher employee costs. Selling and administrative expense increased 23.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by higher employee costs, which more than offset lower restructuring charges of 7.2 million. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net decreased 3.4 million and 8.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by the refinancing of our senior secured term loans in April 2024 and August 2023, which included a partial principal prepayment of 102.3 million during the third quarter of 2023. 
 Income taxes 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s effective tax rate was 22.5 compared to a benefit of 3.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The higher effective tax rate in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by the favorable return-to-provision adjustment related to a capital loss deduction in 2023 not repeating in 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s effective tax rate was 24.3 compared to 26.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The lower effective tax rate in 2024 was primarily driven by lower foreign valuation allowances in 2024. This was partially offset by the favorable return-to-provision adjustment related to a capital loss deduction in 2023 not repeating in 2024.

 Sales increased 35.0 million, or 7.2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by increased demand in the packaging, consumer, healthcare and building and construction end markets, partially offset by weakness in the transportation end market and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 0.5 . Sales increased 30.8 million, or 2.0 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increased demand in the packaging, consumer and building and construction end markets, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 0.8 . 
 Operating income increased 11.0 million and 38.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, driven primarily by the impacts of the aforementioned sales increase and margin improvement associated with raw material deflation. 
 Specialty Engineered Materials 
 Sales increased 26.7 million, or 10.0 , and 38.7 million, or 4.4 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by increased demand in defense, building and construction, consumer and healthcare end markets. This was partially offset by demand weakness in the telecommunications and transportation end markets. There was an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 0.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Operating income increased 6.1 million and 19.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to the impacts of increased sales and mix improvement. 
 Corporate 
 Corporate costs decreased 25.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by 35.7 million of lower environmental remediation costs, partially offset by higher employee costs. Corporate costs decreased 32.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by 24.3 million of lower environmental remediation costs and 22.7 million of lower restructuring charges, partially offset by higher employee costs. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and an appropriate mix of debt and equity. By laddering the maturity structure, we avoid concentrations of debt maturities, reducing liquidity risk. We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt with cash and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. We may also seek to repurchase our outstanding common shares. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved have been and may continue to be material. 

15 AVIENT CORPORATION 

The following table summarizes our liquidity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 (In millions) As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 505.7 545.8 Revolving credit availability 233.4 199.7 Liquidity 739.1 745.5 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 82 of the Company s cash and cash equivalents resided outside the United States. 
 Expected sources of cash needed to satisfy cash requirements for the remainder of 2024 include our cash on hand, cash from operations and available liquidity under our revolving credit facility, if necessary. We believe that these sources will also provide sufficient liquidity to satisfy our expected uses of cash for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. Expected uses of cash for the remainder of 2024 include interest payments, cash taxes, dividend payments, environmental remediation costs, capital expenditures and S/4HANA development costs. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following describes the significant components of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased 87.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by higher current year earnings and lower tax payments as 2023 included tax payments of 104.1 million associated with the gain on sale of our Distribution business, partially offset by an increased investment in working capital. 
 Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 79.5 million primarily reflects the impact of capital expenditures. 
 Net cash used by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 65.4 million primarily reflects the impact of capital expenditures of 75.0 million, partially offset by proceeds received from the divestiture of the Distribution business of 7.3 million. 
 Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 93.8 million primarily reflects payment on long-term borrowings of 659.1 million, 70.5 million of dividends paid and 9.6 million of debt financing costs, partially offset by 650.0 million of proceeds from long-term borrowings. 
 Net cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 176.0 million primarily reflects payment on long-term borrowings of 103.8 million and 67.6 million of dividends paid. 
 Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, aggregate maturities of the principal amount of debt for the current year, next four years and thereafter, are as follows:

 On April 9, 2024, the Company refinanced its senior secured term loan by amending the credit agreement governing such term loan (the "Term Loan Amendment"). The amendment reduced the interest rates per annum by 50 basis points, which now are either (i) Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Term Loan Amendment) plus 2.00 , or (ii) a Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Amendment) plus 1.00 . The maturity date and other terms and conditions are substantially the same as the terms and conditions under the credit agreement immediately prior to the Term Loan Amendment.

CAUTIONARY NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, statements that are not reported financial results or other historical information are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance. They are based on management s expectations that involve a number of business risks and uncertainties, any of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "will," anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial condition, performance and/or sales. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions; prospective changes in raw material costs, product pricing or product demand; future performance; estimated capital expenditures; results of current and anticipated market conditions and market strategies; sales efforts; expenses; the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and environmental liabilities; and financial results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 
 disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit markets that could adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future; 
 the effect on foreign operations of currency fluctuations, tariffs and other political, economic and regulatory risks; 
 disruptions or inefficiencies in our supply chain, logistics, or operations; 
 changes in laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we conduct business, including with respect to plastics and climate change; 
 fluctuations in raw material prices, quality and supply, and in energy prices and supply; 
 demand for our products and services;

 unanticipated developments that could occur with respect to contingencies such as litigation and environmental matters; 
 our ability to pay regular quarterly cash dividends and the amounts and timing of any future dividends; 
 information systems failures and cyberattacks; 
 amounts for cash and non-cash charges related to restructuring plans that may differ from original estimates, including because of timing changes associated with the underlying actions; 
 our ability to achieve strategic objectives and successfully integrate acquisitions, including the implementation of a cloud-based enterprise resource planning system, S/4HANA; 
 other factors affecting our business beyond our control, including without limitation, changes in the general economy, changes in interest rates, changes in the rate of inflation, geopolitical conflicts, and any recessionary conditions; and 
 other factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports on Forms 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.
