charge was partially offset by the reversal of bonus accruals. In May 2022, the Company paid Dr. Rabbani in severance (the payment
constituted taxable income, but the Company did not withhold taxes from the payment). In July 2022, the Company paid Dr. Rabbani s

of their motion to dismiss. On November 6, 2023, plaintiff filed an opposition to defendants motion to dismiss. On November 17,
2023, defendants filed a reply brief in further support of their motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On or about July 17, 2024, the
Court granted, in part, the defendants motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On or about August 16, 2024, plaintiff noticed
an appeal from the order granting that dismissal. On or about September 18, 2024, plaintiff filed a Verified Second Amended Complaint.
On October 11, 2024, the defendants filed a joint stipulation and letter requesting the court to extend the deadline to respond to the
Second Amended complaint from October 18, 2024 to November 18, 2024. On November 15, 2024, the plaintiff discontinued the derivative case
and the related appeal (without prejudice). 

On or about September 26, 2023, James G. Wolf, individually and as
the trustee of the Wolf Family Charitable Foundation, Barbaranne R. Wolf, Stephen Paul Wolf, and Preston M. Wolf (collectively the Petitioners initiated an appraisal action against Enzo in the New York Supreme Court for Suffolk County. Petitioners seek an appraisal of the value
of their shares in the Company. The amount of damages sought by the Petitioners is unspecified. On or about August 21, 2024, the Court
dismissed the Company s Second and Third Affirmative Defenses. On or about September 19, 2024, the Court granted the Company permission
to move for leave to reargue the Court s dismissal decision. This matter has been fully briefed by the parties. We do not anticipate
a decision until sometime in the first quarter of 2025. The Company intends to vigorously litigate both (i) Petitioners alleged
entitlement to dissenting shareholder appraisal rights and (ii) the correct valuation of Petitioners shares. 

In our discontinued Clinical Labs operations, third-party payers,
including government programs, may decide to deny payment or recoup payments for testing that they contend was improperly billed or
not medically necessary, against their coverage determinations, or for which they believe they have otherwise overpaid (including as
a result of their own error), and we may be required to refund payments that we received. In April 2024, the Company engaged in
settlement negotiations for a government payer and reached a verbal settlement. The settlement was finalized in a formal written
settlement agreement on August 14, 2024. The settlement resolved allegations that Enzo Clinical Labs, Inc. overbilled the
Connecticut Medicaid program for testing services. The settlement was paid in August 2024 for to resolve the State of
Connecticut s allegations and was paid to settle the whistleblowers legal fees. On September 18, 2024, we received
the unsealed complaint filed by the same whistleblowers in the Southern District of New York SDNY alleging, among
other things, that the Company falsely billed Medicaid and Medicare for COVID-19 tests by utilizing inappropriate diagnostic codes
to trigger payments for such tests. The SDNY advised the court that the government was not intervening in the case; however, the
private plaintiffs are still pursuing the case on the governments behalf. The court has ordered that the matter be stayed until January 15, 2025, so that the
parties may explore potential settlement of the matter.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other information included elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

Our disclosure and analysis in this report, including but not limited
to the information discussed in this Item 2, contain forward-looking information (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). All
statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding the
Company s future financial condition, results of operations and products in research and development may include forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements
by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They typically use words such as anticipate ,
 estimate , expect , project , intend , plan , believe ,
 will , and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operations or financial performance.
All forward-looking statements are subject to important factors, risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including industry and economic
conditions, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 

Forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements
relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products,
sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign currency rates, intellectual property matters, the outcome of contingencies, such as
legal proceedings, and future financial results. We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we
believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate
assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results
could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. As a result, investors are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements.
We do not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement that we make, even if new information becomes available
or other events occur in the future. We are also affected by other factors that may be identified from time to time in our filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, some of which are set forth in Item 1A - Risk Factors in our Form 10-K filing for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2024. You are advised to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic reports on Forms 10-Q,
8-K and 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we have attempted to provide a list of important factors which
may affect our business, investors are cautioned that other factors may prove to be important in the future and could affect our operating
results. 

You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify
all such factors or to assess the impact of each factor or combination of factors on our business. Consequently, you should not consider
any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. 

Overview 

The Company has operated as a life sciences company for over 45 years.
The primary business of Enzo today is conducted through its Enzo Life Sciences division, which focuses on labeling and detection technologies
from DNA to whole cell analysis, including a comprehensive portfolio of thousands of high-quality products, including antibodies, genomic
probes, assays, biochemicals, and proteins. The Company s proprietary products and technologies play central roles in translational
research and drug development areas, including cell biology, genomics, assays, immunohistochemistry, and small molecule chemistry. The
Company monetizes its technology primarily via sales through our global distribution network and licensing. Enzo Life Sciences is operated
through the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. and its wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Costs
excluded from Enzo Life Sciences financial results consist of corporate general and administrative costs and minimal therapeutic research
and development expenses. These costs are reported within the consolidated financial statements as Corporate and Other (see
Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further segment information). 

Discontinued operations sale of Clinical Services business
to Labcorp 

Prior to July 24, 2023, we operated a clinical laboratory, doing business
as Enzo Clinical Labs, which provided reference, molecular and esoteric diagnostic medical testing services in the New York, New Jersey,
and Connecticut medical communities. Effective July 24, 2023, we completed the sale of certain assets used in the operation of Enzo Clinical
Labs and the assignment of certain clinical lab liabilities to Laboratory Corporation of America Labcorp for an aggregate
purchase price of 113.25 million in cash. In accordance with the sale, we ceased our clinical services operations. Excluded from the
sale of the clinical services assets were its cash and accounts receivable. As a consequence of the sale, we have classified as discontinued
operations all income and expenses attributable to the clinical services business for all periods presented. 

21 

Ransomware a ttack 

In April 2023, the Company experienced a ransomware attack that impacted
certain critical information technology systems, principally of the discontinued operation. In response, we promptly deployed containment
measures, including disconnecting our systems from the internet, launching an investigation with assistance from third-party cybersecurity
experts, and notifying law enforcement. We adhered to our disaster recovery plan, which enabled us to maintain operations throughout the
incident response process. The Company s facilities remained open, and we continued to provide services to patients and partners.
We later became aware that certain data, including names, test information, and Social Security numbers, was accessed, and in some instances,
exfiltrated from the Company s information technology systems as part of this incident. The investigation identified unauthorized
access to or acquisition of clinical test information of approximately 2.5 million individuals. The Social Security numbers of approximately
600,000 of these individuals may also have been involved. Additionally, the Company determined that some employees information
may have been involved. The Company provided notice to the individuals whose information may have been involved, as well as to regulatory
authorities, in accordance with applicable law. The Company has incurred, and may continue to incur, related expenses. The Company s
cybersecurity insurance carrier covered up to 3 million of the remediation costs related to the incident and paid service providers from
the policy proceeds. 

The Company remains subject to risks and uncertainties as a result
of the incident, including as a result of the data that was accessed or exfiltrated from the Company s network as noted above. Additionally,
security and privacy incidents have led to, and may continue to lead to, additional regulatory scrutiny and class action litigation exposure.
See Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for discussion of litigation in connection with this incident.

Consolidated Results: 

The 2024 period and the 2023 period refer
to the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Revenues were 6.2 million in the 2024 period and 7.8 million in the
2023 period, a decrease of approximately 1.6 million or 20 due to a reduction in orders from certain large customers in the clinical
market in the comparable periods and a large order from an industrial customer in the 2023 period which was not repeated in the 2024 period.
Overall, we experienced a decline in all geographic areas of our customer base due to declining market demand related to general continued
headwinds in the life sciences tools space. 

The cost of revenues was 3.7 million in the 2024 period and 4.4 million
in the 2023 period, a decrease of 0.7 million or 15 due to lower revenues. The gross profit margin was approximately 41 and 44 in
the 2024 and 2023 periods, respectively. The 2024 period was negatively impacted by inventory disposals due to a portfolio optimization
initiative. The 2023 period gross profit was positively impacted by a decrease in manufacturing headcount, other cost containment measures,
and a more profitable mix of products sold. 

22 

The cost of revenues inventory provision was 0.3 million for
raw material inventory we intended to use in manufacturing and sell to laboratory customers which we fully reserved in the 2024 period.
This expense represents 4 of the period s revenues. 

Research and development expenses were 0.5 million in the 2024 period
and 0.8 million in the 2023 period, a decrease of 0.3 million or 34 . There was an emphasis on manufacturing effort in the 2024 period.
During the 2023 period there was a greater investment in research and development resources and materials consumed. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were 4.9 million during
the 2024 period versus 7.0 million during the 2023 period, a decrease of 2.1 million or 30 . The Corporate and Other segment expense
decreased 2.2 million during the 2024 period primarily due to severance provisions and accelerated recognition of share-based compensation
incurred during the 2023 period of approximately 1.5 million related to a former senior officer. The remainder of the decrease in the
2024 period is due to lower share based compensation for directors and officers and lower bonus accruals. The Products segment expense
in the 2024 period increased 0.1 million compared to 2023 period due to investments in sales and marketing. 

Legal and related expenses were 0.5 million during the 2024 period
and 1.1 million in the 2023 period, a decrease of 0.6 million or 57 . During the 2023 period, we required significantly more legal expertise
and assistance associated with the ransomware attack and matters related to two former senior executives arbitration, one of which
was settled during the 2023 period and one of which is ongoing. 

Interest income, net was 0.6 million in the 2024 period compared to
 1.0 million in the 2023 period, a decrease of 0.4 million or 37 due to a decrease in the balance of cash held in a money market account
and a decline in the interest rate earned due to Federal Reserve actions to lower discount rates. 

We recorded a fair value adjustment charge of approximately 0.3 million
for the Debentures based on their fair value as of October 31, 2023, which were due and fully repaid in May 2024. 

Other income in both periods is primarily from the subletting of a
portion of our office space in New York, NY. 

The foreign exchange loss recognized by the Products segment during
the 2024 period was 0.2 million compared to 1.0 million in the 2023 period, a favorable variance of 0.8 million. 

The foreign exchange loss in the 2024 period was due to the revaluation
of intercompany balances denominated in European currencies into Swiss francs, which appreciated slightly, by our Swiss subsidiary. The
2023 period revaluation loss was due to significant depreciation of the Swiss franc, Euro and British pound as compared to the U.S dollar,
when intercompany balances were higher, especially those denominated in the U.S. dollar. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our aggregate cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2024 was
 47.7 million and 52.3 million as of July 31, 2024. The decrease of 4.6 million in our cash and cash equivalents balance as of October
31, 2024 was primarily due to the period net loss and by cash used to pay down accrued liabilities, particularly those of the discontinued
operations, partially offset by the release from escrow of 5.0 million, as discussed below. Based on the current available working capital,
management believes the Company has sufficient funds to meet its operating requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date
of the filing of this report. Our working capital was 36.3 million and 45.2 million as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. 

Net cash used in operating activities during the 2024 period was 9.0
million, compared to 13.4 million during the 2023 period, a favorable variance of 4.4 million, due to the smaller net loss from continuing
operations in the 2024 period. 

23 

Net cash provided by investing activities during the 2024 period was
approximately 4.6 million and represents the release of cash held in escrow from the Labcorp Asset Purchase Agreement which closed in
July 2023, partially offset by capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities during the 2023 period was approximately 0.3
million for capital expenditures. 

Net cash used in financing activities in the 2024 and 2023 periods
amounted to 0.2 million and 0.5 million primarily for taxes on bonuses paid in stock. 

Labcorp Asset Purchase Agreement and release of Cash in Escrow 

We had indemnification obligations to Labcorp under the Asset Purchase
Agreement that could have required us to make payments to Labcorp and other related persons for any damages incurred by Labcorp or such
related persons as a result of any breaches of our representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the Asset Purchase
Agreement, or arising from retained liabilities or certain third-party claims specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement. Generally, our
representations and warranties survived for a period of 15 months from the closing date, which was July 24, 2023, other than certain fundamental
representations, which survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. There is an indemnification cap with respect
to a majority of the Company s indemnification obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement with the exception of claims for actual
fraud, the breach of any fundamental representations and certain other items, which are subject to a higher indemnification cap (up to
the purchase price). 

Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we, Labcorp,
and an escrow agent entered into an Escrow Agreement at closing, pursuant to which Labcorp deposited 5 million of the aggregate purchase
price of the clinical service business into an escrow account in order to satisfy, in whole or in part, certain of our indemnity obligations,
if any, that arose under the Asset Purchase Agreement. Labcorp made no claims and required only a reimbursement of certain legal fees
it had incurred, which were immaterial. On October 30, 2024, the escrowed funds of 5.0 million were released to the Company and are included
in cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2024. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements 
as such term is described in Item 303 of Regulation S-K. 

General and estimates 

The Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition
and results of operations are based upon Enzo Biochem, Inc. s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments also affect related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. 

On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related
to contractual expense, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Contingencies 

Contingencies are evaluated and a liability is recorded when the matter
is both probable and reasonably estimable. Gain contingencies are evaluated and not recognized until the gain is realizable or realized. 

24 

Product revenues 

Products revenues consist of the sale of single-use products used in
the identification of genomic information and are recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to
the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Payment terms for shipments to end-user and distributor customers may range from 30
to 90 days. Any claims for credit or return of goods may be made generally within 30 days of receipt. Revenues are reduced to reflect
estimated credits and returns, although historically these adjustments have not been material. Taxes collected from customers relating
to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling
are included in revenue, while the related shipping and handling costs are reflected in cost of products. 

Accounts Receivable 

Accounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of expected
credit losses, which is estimated and recorded in the period of the related revenue. 

As of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, Products accounts receivable,
net were 3,842 and 3,988, respectively. As of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, these totals include foreign receivables, net, of
 847 and 1,185, respectively. 

Inventory 

The Company values inventory at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out)
or net realizable value. Work-in-process and finished goods inventories consist of material, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Write
downs of inventories to net realizable value are based on a review of inventory quantities on hand and estimated sales forecasts based
on sales history and anticipated future demand. Unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory
and require additional write downs of inventory which would impact our results of operations. 

Long-Lived Assets 

The Company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived
depreciable assets of an asset or asset group for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist. Should indicators of impairment
exist, the carrying values of the depreciable assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash
flows of an asset or asset group. The net book value of the depreciable long lived asset is adjusted to fair value if its expected future
undiscounted cash flow is less than its book value. 

During the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 there was no
impairment of depreciable long-lived assets used in continuing operations. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the
information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s
management conducted an evaluation (as required under Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act) of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined under the Exchange Act), under the supervision and with the participation of each
of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based on the evaluation of our Disclosure Controls, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of October 31, 2024, our Disclosure Controls were effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

that occurred during the period ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
