While most of the Company s investments will be in private U.S. companies (subject to compliance with BDC regulatory requirement to invest at least 70 of its assets in private U.S. companies), we also expect to invest from time to time in European and other non-U.S. companies. The investment portfolio may also include other interests such as corporate bonds, common stock, preferred stock, warrants or options, which generally would be obtained as part of providing a broader financing solution. Under normal circumstances, we will invest directly or indirectly at least 80 of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in debt instruments of varying maturities.

of its investment company taxable income as defined by the Code, for each year. The Company (among other requirements) has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from corporate-level income taxes. For income tax purposes, distributions made to stockholders are reported as ordinary income, capital gains, non-taxable return of capital, or a combination thereof. The tax character of distributions paid to stockholders through September 30, 2024 may include return of capital, however, the exact amount cannot be determined at this point. The final determination of the tax character of distributions will not be made until we file Form 1099s for the tax year ending December 31, 2024. The character of income and gains that we will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividend and distributions and other permanent book and tax difference are reclassified to paid-in capital. If we do not distribute (or are not deemed to have distributed) at least of our annual ordinary income and of our capital gain net income for the 1-year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year, we will generally be required to pay excise tax equal to of the amount by which of our annual ordinary income and of our capital gains exceed the distributions from such taxable income for the year. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income, we accrue excise taxes, if any, on estimated undistributed taxable income. If we fail to satisfy the annual distribution requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distribution would generally be taxable to our individual and other non-corporate taxable stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate applicable to qualified dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits provided certain holding period and other requirements are met. Subject to certain limitation under the Code, corporate distributions would be eligible for the dividend-received deduction. To qualify again to be taxed as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to distribute to our stockholders our accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non RIC years. In addition, if we failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, then, in order to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built-in gain (the excess of aggregate gain, including items of income, over aggregate loss that would have been realized if we had been liquidated) or, alternatively, be subject to taxation on such built-in gain recognized for a period of five years. We follow ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ). ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Penalties or interest, if applicable, that may be assessed relating to income taxes would be classified as other operating expenses in the consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2024 , there were uncertain tax positions and amounts accrued for interest or penalties. Management s determinations regar ding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Although we file both federal and state income tax returns, our major tax jurisdiction is federal.

term and thereafter will continue for successive annual periods provided that such continuance is specifically approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of the Company s outstanding voting securities and, in each case, a majority of the independent trustees. . The Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment within the meaning of the 1940 Act and related SEC guidance and interpretations. On August 8, 2024, the Advisory Agreement was renewed and continued for an additional one-year period. The Company pays the Adviser a fee for its services under the Advisory Agreement consisting of two components, a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by the shareholders. Substantial additional fees and expenses may also be charged by the Administrator to the Company, which is an affiliate of the Adviser. Base Management Fee The base management fee is payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of of the value of the Company s net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month. For purposes of the Advisory Agreement, net assets means our total assets less liabilities determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For the first calendar month in which the Company had operations, net assets was measured as the beginning net assets as of the date on which the Company broke escrow for the initial offering. Incentive Fee The incentive fee consists of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of our income and a portion is based on a percentage of our capital gains, each as described below. A. Incentive Fee based on Income The portion based on our income is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that are received from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement entered into between the Company and the Administrator, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee and any distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that has not yet been received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The impact of expense support payments and recoupments are also excluded from Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of return of per quarter annualized).

per quarter annualized); 

 of the dollar amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of annualized). This catch-up portion is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 

 of the dollar amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to the Adviser. 

 These calculations are pro-rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. B. Incentive Fee based on Cumulative Net Realized Gains The second component of the Incentive Fee, the Capital Gains Incentive Fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. The amount payable equals of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP. Each year, the fee paid for the capital gains incentive fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for all prior periods. We will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser if we were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain.

On August 8, 2024, the Administration Agreement was renewed and continued for an additional one-year period. Sub-Administration Agreement On January 6, 2022, the Administrator entered into a sub-administration agreement (the Sub-Administration Agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company. The sub-administrator will receive compensation for its sub-administrative services under the Sub-Administration Agreement. Intermediary Manager Agreement On November 10, 2021, the Company entered into an Intermediary Manager Agreement (the Intermediary Manager Agreement with Apollo Global Securities, LLC. (the Intermediary Manager ), an affiliate of the Adviser, which is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and a member of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. FINRA ).

The Intermediary Manager will be entitled to receive distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees monthly in arrears at an annual rate of of the value of the Company s net assets attributable to Class D shares as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the month. distribution and/or shareholding servicing fees will be paid with respect to Class I shares. The distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees will be payable to the Intermediary Manager, but the Intermediary Manager anticipates that all or a portion of the shareholder servicing fees will be retained by, or reallowed (paid) to, participating broker-dealers. The Company will cease paying the distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees on the Class S shares and Class D shares on the earlier to occur of the following: (i) a listing of Class I shares, (ii) a merger or consolidation with or into another entity, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s assets or (iii) the date following the completion of the primary portion of our offering on which, in the aggregate, underwriting compensation from all sources in connection with the offering, including the distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees and other underwriting compensation, is equal to of the gross proceeds from the primary offering. In addition, the Company will cease paying the distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees on any Class S shares and Class D shares in a shareholder s account at the end of the month in which the Intermediary Manager in conjunction with the transfer agent determines that total brokerage commissions and distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees paid with respect to any such share held by such shareholder within such account would exceed, in the aggregate, of the gross proceeds from the sale of such share. At the end of such month, each such Class S shares or Class D shares will convert into a number of Class I shares (including any fractional shares), with an equivalent aggregate NAV as such share. The Intermediary Manager is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC is a member of FINRA. The Intermediary Manager Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by vote of a majority of the Company s trustees who are not interested persons , as defined in the 1940 Act, of the Company and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of the Company s distribution plan or the Intermediary Manager Agreement or by vote a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, on not more than 60 days written notice to the Intermediary Manager or the Adviser.

The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees is paid monthly in arrears, calculated using the NAV of the applicable class as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the month and subject to FINRA and other limitations on underwriting compensation. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company accrued distribution and shareholder servicing fees of and , respectively, which were attributable to Class S shares. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company accrued distribution and shareholder servicing fees of and , respectively, which were attributable to Class D shares.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company accrued distribution and shareholder servicing fees of and , respectively, attributable to Class D shares. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are similar to sales commissions. The distribution and servicing expenses borne by the participating brokers may be different from and substantially less than the amount of shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees charged. The Intermediary Manager will reallow (pay) all or a portion of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to participating brokers and servicing brokers for ongoing shareholder services performed by such brokers, and will waive shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to the extent a broker is not eligible to receive it for failure to provide such services. All or a portion of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee may be used to pay for sub-transfer agency, sub-accounting and certain other administrative services that are not required to be paid pursuant to the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees under FINRA rules. The Company also may pay for these sub-transfer agency, sub- accounting and certain other administrative services outside of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees and its Distribution and Servicing Plan. Because the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to Class S shares and Class D shares are calculated based on the aggregate NAV for all of the outstanding shares of each such class, it reduces the NAV with respect to all shares of each such class, including shares issued under the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. Eligibility to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee is conditioned on a broker providing the following ongoing services with respect to the Class S shares or Class D shares: assistance with recordkeeping, answering investor inquiries regarding us, including regarding distribution payments and reinvestments, helping investors understand their investments upon their request, and assistance with share repurchase requests. If the applicable broker is not eligible to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee due to failure to provide these services, the Intermediary Manager will waive the shareholder servicing fee and/or distribution that broker would have otherwise been eligible to receive. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are ongoing fees that are not paid at the time of purchase. Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement The Company entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. The Adviser may elect to pay certain expenses (each, an Expense Payment ), provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest or distributions and/or shareholder servicing fees of the Company.

Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only in accordance with the Order from the SEC permitting us to do so. Under the terms of the Order, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent trustees must be able to reach certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our Board of Trustees approved criteria. In certain situations where co-investment with one or more funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates is not covered by the Order, the personnel of the Adviser or its affiliates will need to decide which fund will proceed with the investment. Such personnel will make these determinations based on allocation policies and procedures, which are designed to reasonably ensure that investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among affiliated funds over time and in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The Order is subject to certain terms and conditions so there can be no assurance that we will be permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates other than in the circumstances currently permitted by regulatory guidance and the Order. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s co-investment holdings were of the portfolio or , measured at fair value. On a cost basis, of the portfolio or were co-investments.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s debt and equity securities are primarily earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA comparable multiples and market discount rates. The Company typically uses EBITDA comparable multiples on its equity securities to determine the fair value of investments. The Company uses market discount rates for debt securities to determine if the effective yield on a debt security is commensurate with the market yields for that type of debt security. If a debt security s effective yield is significantly less than the market yield for a similar debt security with a similar credit profile, the resulting fair value of the debt security may be lower. For certain investments where fair value is derived based on a recovery analysis, the Company uses underlying commodity prices from third party market pricing services to determine the fair value and/or recoverable amount, which represents the proceeds expected to be collected through asset sales or liquidation. Further, for certain investments, the Company also considered the probability of future events which are not in management s control. Significant increases or decreases in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the structured products include the discount rate applied in the valuation models in addition to default and recovery rates applied to projected cash flows in the valuation models. Specifically, when a discounted cash flow model is used to determine fair value, the significant input used in the valuation model is the discount rate applied to present value the projected cash flows. Increases in the discount rate can significantly lower the fair value of an investment; conversely decreases in the discount rate can significantly increase the fair value of an investment. The discount rate is determined based on the market rates an investor would expect for a similar investment with similar risks.

Share Repurchase Program At the discretion of our Board of Trustees, the Company has commenced a share repurchase program in which it intends to repurchase the Company s common shares outstanding as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board of Trustees may amend or suspend the share repurchase program if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. Should the Board of Trustees suspend the share repurchase program, the Board of Trustees will consider whether the continued suspension of the program is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders on a quarterly basis. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. Under the share repurchase plan, to the extent the Company offers to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, it is expected to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers on or around the last business day of that quarter using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders.

It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Financial Statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events our future performance or financial condition and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and Part II, Item 1A of and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in any forward-looking statements. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents the period from January 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024. 
 These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Apollo Debt Solutions BDC (the Company , we , us , or our ), our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, outlook, potential, predicts and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 our future operating results; 

our business prospects and the prospects of the companies in which we may invest; 

the impact of the investments that we expect to make; 

our ability to raise sufficient capital to execute our investment strategy; 

general economic and political trends and other external factors; 

the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

our current and expected financing arrangements and investments; 

changes in the general interest rate environment; 

the adequacy of our cash resources, financing sources and working capital; 

the timing and amount of cash flows, distributions and dividends, if any, from our portfolio companies; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

actual and potential conflicts of interest with the Adviser or any of its affiliates 

the elevating levels of inflation, and its impact on our portfolio companies and on the industries in which we invest; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we may invest; 

our use of financial leverage; 

the ability of the Adviser to source suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 

the ability of the Adviser or its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 

our ability to qualify for and maintain our qualification as a regulated investment company and as a BDC; 

the impact on our business of U.S. and international financial reform legislation, rules and regulations; 

the effect of changes to tax legislation and our tax position; and 

the tax status of the enterprises in which we may invest. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. These forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this report. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law. Because we are an investment company, the forward-looking statements and projections contained in this report are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Act, as amended (the 1934 Act ).

Overview 
 We are a newly organized, externally managed, diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Formed as a Delaware statutory trust on December 4, 2020, we are externally managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. Our Adviser is registered as investment adviser with the SEC. We also have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code. 
 Under our Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Adviser a management fee as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Also, under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including, but not limited to, our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs. 

Most of the debt instruments we invest in are unrated or rated below investment grade, which is often an indication of size, credit worthiness and speculative nature relative to the capacity of the borrower to pay interest and principal. Generally, if our unrated investments were rated, they would be rated below investment grade. These securities, which are often referred to as junk or high yield , have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. They may also be difficult to value and are illiquid. 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on loans and securities, including syndicated loans, of private U.S. companies. Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to private companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, trading prices of loans and other securities and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies. Our senior and subordinated debt investments are expected to bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with transactions. Original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 
 Expenses 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, is provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (a) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement; (b) our allocable portion of compensation, overhead (including rent, office equipment and utilities) and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, including but not limited to: (i) our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs; (ii) investor relations, legal, operations and other non-investment professionals at the Administrator that performs duties for us; and (iii) any internal audit group personnel of AGM or any of its affiliates; and (c) all other expenses of our operations, administrations and transactions. 
 With respect to costs incurred in connection with our organization and offering and all other costs incurred prior to the time we break escrow for the offering, the Adviser has agreed to advance all such costs on our behalf. Unless the Adviser elects to cover such expenses pursuant to the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement we entered into with the Adviser, we will be obligated to reimburse the Adviser for such advanced expenses upon breaking escrow for our offering of common shares. See Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. Any reimbursements that may be made by us in the future will not exceed actual expenses incurred by the Adviser and its affiliates. 
 From time to time, the Adviser, the Administrator or their affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Adviser, the Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, the Adviser or the Administrator may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders.

Our Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 

periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company s industry; and 

review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 

As part of the monitoring process, our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows: 

Investment Rating 

Description 

1 

Investments rated 1 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable; 

2 

Investments rated 2 involve an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. The borrower is generally performing as expected and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a rating of 2; 

3 

Investments rated 3 involve a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased somewhat since origination or acquisition; 

4 

Investments rated 4 involve a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased materially since origination or acquisition. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 120 days past due); and 

5 

Investments rated 5 involve a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. 

The following table shows the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 5 rating scale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including acquisitions, the level of new investment commitments, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. Additionally, as many of the noted period over period changes resulted from our deployment of capital and increased balance of our investments, comparisons may not be meaningful.

Management fees are payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25 of the value of our net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month. No management fees have been waived for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross management fees increased to 59.6 million from 24.7 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in average net assets.

Realized losses on foreign currency forward contracts were partially offset by net realized gains of 2.5 million from full or partial sales and/ or restructuring of our debt investments, and net realized gains of 3.0 million from repayments of foreign borrowings, and conversion of foreign cash balances, primarily attributable to fluctuations in the Euro and British Pound exchange rates. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated net realized losses of 40.6 million, driven by net realized losses of 37.7 million on foreign currency forward contracts, as a result of fluctuations primarily in the Euro and British Pound exchange rates, and net realized losses of 17.7 million on foreign currency transactions, as a result of repayments of foreign borrowings, and conversion of foreign cash balances, primarily attributable to fluctuations in the Euro and British Pound exchange rates. Realized losses were partially offset by net realized gains of 14.0 million from full or partial sales and/ or restructuring of our debt investments. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated net realized gains of 6.6 million and 1.2 million, respectively, primarily from full or partial sales of our liquid debt investments.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized gross unrealized gains on investments of 131.6 million and gross unrealized losses on investments of 57.3 million, resulting in a net change in unrealized gains of 74.3 million for the third fiscal quarter of 2024. The fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of principal remained fairly consistent between June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024. However, our foreign investments saw unrealized gains due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British Pound, Swiss Franc, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Korean Won. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized gross unrealized gains on investments of 43.2 million and gross unrealized losses on investments of 34.3 million, resulting in net change in unrealized gains of 8.9 million for the third fiscal quarter of 2023. The fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of principal increased from 95.4 as of June 30, 2023 to 97.9 as of September 30, 2023, driven by strong portfolio company fundamentals and performance of the syndicated loan market and changes in the economic outlook. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized gross unrealized gains on investments of 190.2 million and gross unrealized losses on investments of 115.1 million, resulting in net change in unrealized gains of 75.1 million on investments year-to-date. The fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of principal increased from 98.0 as of December 31, 2023 to 99.9 as of September 30, 2024, driven by strong portfolio company fundamentals and increase in directly originated loans in the Company's portfolio. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized gross unrealized gains on investments of 122.2 million and gross unrealized losses on investments of 19.6 million, resulting in net change in unrealized gains of 102.6 million on investments year-to-date. The fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of principal increased from 96.3 as of December 31, 2022 to 97.9 as of September 30, 2023, driven by strong portfolio company fundamentals and performance of the syndicated loan market and changes in the economic outlook. 
 The net unrealized gains (losses) amounts include the impact of transferring unrealized appreciation (depreciation) to realized gains (losses) due to sale and paydown activity.

Interest Rate Swaps 
 The Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the Company's fixed rate liabilities, and has designated certain interest rate swaps to be in a hedge accounting relationship. See Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies and Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 5. Derivative Instruments for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for derivative instruments designated in a hedge accounting relationship, and our consolidated schedule of investments for additional disclosure regarding these derivative instruments. See Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6. Debt and Foreign Currency Transactions and Translations for additional disclosure regarding the carrying value of our debt. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company s liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through our continuous offering of common shares and debt offerings, our Senior Secured Facility (as defined in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements), investments in special purpose entities in which we may hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and repayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had three asset based leverage facilities, four private placement/unsecured notes issuances, one CLO warehouse facility and one revolving credit facility outstanding. We have and will continue to, from time to time, enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities or issue additional debt securities, including debt securitizations and unsecured debt. Any such incurrence or issuance may be from sources within the U.S. or from various foreign geographies or jurisdictions, and may be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Additionally, any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150 . 
 We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our short-term investments, our available borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations in the near term. 
 Cash Equivalents 
 The Company defines cash equivalents as securities that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only securities with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase would qualify, with limited exceptions. The Company deems that certain money market funds, U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and other high-quality, short-term debt securities would qualify as cash equivalents (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.) At the end of each fiscal quarter, we consider taking proactive steps utilizing cash equivalents with the objective of enhancing our investment flexibility during the following quarter, pursuant to Section 55 of the 1940 Act. More specifically, we may purchase U.S. Treasury bills from time-to-time on the last business day of the quarter and typically close out that position on the following business day, settling the sale transaction on a net cash basis with the purchase, subsequent to quarter end. We may also utilize repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions, including drawing down on our Senior Secured Facility, as we deem appropriate.

The Company has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which the Company will reinvest all cash dividends declared by the Board on behalf of our shareholders who do not elect to receive their dividends in cash as provided below. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and the Company declares, a cash dividend or other distribution, then shareholders who have not opted out of our distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder s account to three decimal places. 
 Sources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a U.S. GAAP basis, include required adjustments to U.S. GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions. The following table reflects the sources of cash distributions on a U.S. GAAP basis that the Company has declared on its shares of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):

Table of Contents 

To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute at least 90 of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. Although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investments. 
 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC, we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions. Also, our Senior Secured Facility and SPV Financing Facilities may limit our ability to declare distributions if we default under certain provisions or fail to satisfy certain other conditions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we may suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a RIC. In addition, in accordance with GAAP and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as contractual PIK, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may not be able to meet the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a RIC. With respect to the distributions to stockholders, income from origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to stockholders. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 At the discretion of our Board of Trustees, the Company has commenced a share repurchase program in which it has the ability to repurchase the Company s common shares outstanding as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board of Trustees may amend or suspend the share repurchase program if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. Should the Board of Trustees suspend the share repurchase program, the Board of Trustees will consider whether the continued suspension of the program is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders on a quarterly basis. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under the share repurchase plan, to the extent the Company offers to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, it is expected to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers on or around the last business day of that quarter using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV (the " Early Repurchase Deduction "). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders. 
 The following table presents information with respect to the Company s share repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):

 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Adviser to provide us with investment advisory services and the Administration Agreement with the Administrator to provide us with administrative services. We have also entered into an Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser to provide us with support with respect to certain expenses and subject to reimbursement. Payments for investment advisory services under the Advisory Agreements, reimbursements under the Administration Agreement and support and reimbursements under the Expense Support Agreement are described in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Fees, Expenses, Agreements and Related Party Transactions. 
 We intend to establish one or more credit facilities or enter into other financing arrangements to facilitate investments and the timely payment of our expenses. It is anticipated that any such credit facilities will bear interest at floating rates at to-be-determined spreads over SOFR or an alternative reference rate. We cannot assure shareholders that we will be able to enter into a credit facility on favorable terms or at all. In connection with a credit facility or other borrowings, lenders may require us to pledge assets, commitments and/or drawdowns (and the ability to enforce the payment thereof) and may ask to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Portfolio Company Commitments 
 Our investment portfolio contains and is expected to continue to contain debt investments which are in the form of lines of credit or delayed draw commitments, which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with underlying loan agreements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had unfunded commitments, including delayed draw term loans and revolvers, with an aggregate principal amount of 1,597.0 million and 789.9 million, respectively. 
 Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 From time to time, we may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business. As of September 30, 2024, management is not aware of any material pending or threatened litigation that would require accounting recognition or financial statement disclosure. 
 Related-Party Transactions 
 We entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 Advisory Agreement; 

Administration Agreement 

Intermediary Manager Agreement; and 

Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. 

In addition to the aforementioned agreements, we, our Adviser and certain of our Adviser s affiliates have been granted exemptive relief by the SEC to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. See Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Fees, Expenses, Agreements and Related Party Transactions.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting estimates should be read in connection with our risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies. of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Investments 
 
 Investment transactions are all recorded on a trade date basis. Investments are recognized when we assume an obligation to acquire a financial instrument and assume the risks for gains and losses related to that instrument. Investments are derecognized when we assume an obligation to sell a financial instrument and forego the risks for gains or losses related to that instrument. Investment transactions that have not yet settled as of the period-end date are reported as a receivable for investments sold and a payable for investments purchased, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. 
 
 Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received and the amortized cost basis of the investment. The cost of investments is relieved using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period. 
 
 Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, our Board of Trustees has designated the Adviser as its valuation designee to perform the fair value determinations for investments held by us without readily available market quotations. The Company's Board of Trustees continues to be responsible for overseeing the processes for determining fair valuation. 
 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations. In order to verify whether market quotations are deemed to represent fair value, the Adviser, looks at certain factors including the source and nature of the quotations. Market quotations may be deemed not to represent fair value in certain circumstances where the Adviser reasonably believes that facts and circumstances applicable to an issuer, a seller or purchaser or the market for a particular security causes current market quotes not to reflect the fair value of the security. Examples of these events could include cases in which material events are announced after the close of the market on which a security is primarily traded, when a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale or in the event of a fire sale by a distressed seller. 
 
 If and when market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, we typically utilize independent third party valuation firms to assist us in determining fair value. Accordingly, such investments go through our multi-step valuation process as described below. The Adviser engages multiple independent valuation firms based on a review of each firm s expertise and relevant experience in valuing certain securities. In each case, our independent valuation firms consider observable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations for such Level 3 categorized assets. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, our Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 (1) Independent valuation firms engaged conduct independent appraisals and assessments for all the investments they have been engaged to review. If an independent valuation firm is not engaged during a particular quarter, the valuation may be conducted by the Adviser; 

(2) At least each quarter, the valuation will be reassessed and updated by the Adviser or an independent valuation firm to reflect company specific events and latest market data; 

(3) Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of our Adviser; 

(4) The Adviser discusses valuations and determines in good faith the fair value of each investment in our portfolio based on the input of the applicable independent valuation firm; and 

(5) For Level 3 investments entered into within the current quarter, the cost (purchase price adjusted for accreted original issue discount/amortized premium) or any recent comparable trade activity on the security investment shall be considered to reasonably approximate the fair value of the investment, provided that no material change has since occurred in the issuer s business, significant inputs or the relevant environment.

Table of Contents 

Investments are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to the Company s valuation techniques and related inputs considered in the valuation process. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: 
 available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, 

applicable market yields and multiples, 

security covenants, 

seniority of investments in the investee company s capital structure, 

call protection provisions, 

information rights, 

the nature and realizable value of any collateral, 

the portfolio company s ability to make payments, 

earnings and discounted cash flows, 

the markets in which the portfolio company does business, 

comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, 

M A comparables, 

our principal market (as the reporting entity) and 

enterprise values, among other factors. 

Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, substantially all of our portfolio investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our investment adviser, as the valuation designee, as described herein. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had an active market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. 
 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. 
 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
 The Company follows guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ), where fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are determined within a framework that establishes a three-tier hierarchy which maximizes the use of observable market data and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs to establish a classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk, such as the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value using a pricing model and/or the risk inherent in the inputs for the valuation technique. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the information available. The inputs or methodology used for valuing assets or liabilities may not be an indication of the risks associated with investing in those assets or liabilities. 
 
 137 

Table of Contents 

ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy: 
 
 Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date. 
 
 Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices. 
 
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
 
 In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment. The level assigned to the investment valuations may not be indicative of the risk or liquidity associated with investing in such investments. Because of the inherent uncertainties of valuation, the values reflected in the consolidated financial statements may differ materially from the values that would be received upon an actual disposition of such investments. 
 
 See Notes 2 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio. For additional information concerning potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Part II - Other Information, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Investment Valuation Risk 
 Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, we value most of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Trustees based on, among other things, the input of our management and audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our Board of Trustees to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation (with certain de minimis exceptions). Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates as well as Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for more information relating to our investment valuation. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 97 of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at variable rates, which generally are SOFR based (or based on an equivalent applicable currency rate) and typically have durations of one to six months after which they reset to current market interest rates, and many of which are subject to certain floors. Our Senior Secured Facility and SPV Financing Facilities bear interest at SOFR rates with no interest rate floor. Our Unsecured Notes, which bear interest at fixed rates, are hedged by entering into fixed to floating interest rate swaps, in order to align the interest rates of our liabilities in our investment portfolio. 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates.

The following table shows the estimated annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate flows for variable rate instruments) to our loan portfolio and outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024, assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from time-to-time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 Management has not identified any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may become involved in various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While we do not expect that the resolution of these matters if they arise would materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, resolution will be subject to various uncertainties and could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. 
 On March 14, 2023, certain First Lien and Second Lien holders of debt issued by Mitel filed a complaint in New York State Court captioned Ocean Trails CLO VII et al v. MLN TopCo Ltd., et al, Index No. 651327/2023, against certain other First Lien and Second Lien debt holders, including Apollo Debt Solutions BDC, alleging, among other things, that the defendant lenders breached the terms of their lending agreements and the New York Uniform Voidable Transfer Act in connection with certain amendments to the relevant documents governing the debt. Plaintiffs seek to have the amendments in question declared void. On December 5, 2023, the trial court granted defendants motions to dismiss in part and denied them in part. The trial matter is currently in discovery. The plaintiffs and defendants have also taken interlocutory appeals of the courts motion to dismiss ruling to the intermediate New York State appellate court, which are pending. No reasonable estimate of possible loss, if any, can be made at this time. 
 Other than the matter disclosed above, we are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge are any material legal proceedings threatened against us.

 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 Refer to our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with SEC on July 22, 2024, August 21, 2024 and September 20, 2024 for information about unregistered sales of our equity securities during the quarter. 
 Shares Repurchases 
 
We have commenced a share repurchase program in which we intend to offer to repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of our Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. Our Board of Trustees may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under our share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we expect to repurchase shares pursuant to quarterly tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV.

 During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 , ne of our directors or executive officers adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement . 
 Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Facility 
 On October 17, 2024, the Company amended and extended the Senior Secured Facility (the Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Facility ). Lender commitments under the Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Facility increased from 2.185 billion to 2.740 billion and the Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Facility's accordion feature that allows the Company to increase the size of the Facility increased from 3.2775 billion to 4.110 billion. 
 The final maturity date under the Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Facility was extended by over one year from October 12, 2028 to October 17, 2029. The covenants and representations and warranties the Company is required to comply with were also modified (including, among other things, that the minimum shareholders equity test was reset), but the remaining terms and conditions of the Senior Secured Facility remain substantially the same. The Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Facility continues to include usual and customary events of default for senior secured revolving credit facilities of this type. 
 Borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Facility (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) continue to be subject to compliance with a Borrowing Base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in the Company s portfolio. The advance rate applicable to any specific type of asset in the Company s portfolio depends on the relevant asset coverage ratio as of the date of determination. Borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Facility continue to be subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the 1940 Act. 
 Amended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 On November 7, 2024, the Board adopted the amended and restated distribution reinvestment plan of the Company (the Amended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan ). The Amended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan amends the Company's previously effective distribution reinvestment plan to update the list of states that do not permit automatic enrollment in the distribution reinvestment plan.

AMENDED AND RESTATED DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT PLAN 
 Effective November 7, 2024 
 This Amended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan (the Plan is adopted by Apollo Debt Solutions BDC (the Fund and amends and restates in its entirety the Distribution Reinvestment Plan adopted by the Fund effective as of January 7, 2022. 
 1. Distribution Reinvestment. As agent for the shareholders (the Shareholders of the Fund who (i) purchase Class S shares, Class D shares or Class I shares of the Fund s common shares of beneficial interest (collectively the Shares pursuant to the Fund s continuous public offering (the Offering ), or (ii) purchase Shares pursuant to any future offering of the Fund, and who do not opt out of participating in the Plan (or, in the case of investors in certain states that do not permit automatic enrollment in the Plan, as described in the Prospectus (as defined below) (the Opt-In States ), and clients of participating broker-dealers that do not permit automatic enrollment in the Plan, who opt to participate in the Plan) (the Participants ), the Fund will apply all dividends and other distributions declared and paid in respect of the Shares held by each Participant and attributable to the class of Shares purchased by such Participant (the Distributions ), including Distributions paid with respect to any full or fractional Shares acquired under the Plan, to the purchase of additional Shares of the same class for such Participant. 

2. Effective Date. The effective date of this Plan shall be November 7, 2024. 

3. Procedure for Participation. Any Shareholder (unless such Shareholder is a resident of an Opt-In State or is a client of a participating broker-dealer that does not permit automatic enrollment in the Plan) who has received the Fund s prospectus (as amended and/or supplemented from time to time, the Prospectus ), as contained in the Fund s registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), will automatically become a Participant unless they elect not to become a Participant by noting such election on their subscription agreement. Any Shareholder who is a resident of an Opt-In State or is a client of a participating broker-dealer that does not permit automatic enrollment in the Plan who has received the Prospectus will become a Participant if they elect to become a Participant by noting such election on their subscription agreement. If any Shareholder initially elects not to be a Participant, they may later become a Participant by subsequently completing and executing an enrollment form or any appropriate authorization form as may be available from the Fund or SS C GIDS, Inc. (formerly, DST Systems, Inc.) (the Plan Administrator ). Participation in the Plan will begin with the next Distribution payable after acceptance of a Participant s subscription, enrollment or authorization. Shares will be purchased under the Plan as of the first calendar day of the month (the Purchase Date following the record date of the Distribution. 

4. Suitability. Each Participant is requested to promptly notify the Fund in writing if the Participant experiences a material change in his or her financial condition, including the failure to meet the income, net worth and investment concentration standards imposed by such Participant s state of residence and set forth in the Prospectus. For the avoidance of doubt, this request in no way shifts to the Participant the responsibility of the Fund s sponsor, or any other person selling Shares on behalf of the Fund to the Participant to make every reasonable effort to determine that the purchase of Shares is a suitable and appropriate investment based on information provided by such Participant. 

5. Purchase of Shares. 

a. The Fund shall use newly-issued Shares to implement the Plan. The number of newly-issued Shares to be issued to a Shareholder shall be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to such Shareholder by a price equal to the net asset value as of the Purchase Date. Shares issued pursuant to the Plan will have the same voting rights as Shares issued pursuant to the Offering. The Fund shall pay the Plan Administrator s fees under the Plan. 

b. No upfront selling commissions will be payable with respect to Shares purchased pursuant to the Plan, but such Shares will be subject to ongoing distributor and/or shareholder servicing fees. Participants in the Plan may purchase fractional Shares so that 100 of the Distributions will be used to acquire Shares. 

6. Notice. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be given by any provision of this Plan shall be in writing and addressed to Apollo Debt Solutions BDC, c/o SS C GIDS, Inc. if to the Plan Administrator, or such other addresses as may be specified by written notice to all Participants. Notices to a Participant may be given by letter addressed to the Participant at the Participant s last address of record with the Fund. Each Participant shall notify the Fund promptly in writing of any change of address. 

7. Taxes. THE REINVESTMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS DOES NOT RELIEVE A PARTICIPANT OF ANY INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT MAY BE PAYABLE ON THE DISTRIBUTIONS. INFORMATION REGARDING POTENTIAL TAX INCOME LIABILITY OF PARTICIPANTS MAY BE FOUND IN THE PUBLIC FILINGS MADE BY THE FUND WITH THE SEC. 

8. Share Certificates. The ownership of the Shares purchased through the Plan will be in book-entry form unless and until the Fund issues certificates for its outstanding Shares. 

9. Termination by Participant. A Participant may terminate participation in the Plan at any time, without penalty, by delivering notice to the Plan Administrator. Such notice must be received by the Plan Administrator five business days in advance of the first calendar day of the next month in order for a Participant s termination to be effective for such month. 

Any transfer of Shares by a Participant to a non-Participant will terminate participation in the Plan with respect to the transferred Shares. If a Participant elects to tender its Shares in full, any Shares issued to the Participant under the Plan subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer will be considered part of the Participant s prior tender, and Participant s participation in the Plan will be terminated as of the valuation date of the applicable tender offer. Any distributions to be paid to such Shareholder on or after such date will be paid in cash on the scheduled distribution payment date. If a Participant terminates Plan participation, the Fund may, at its option, ensure that the terminating Participant s account will reflect the whole number of Shares in such Participant s account and provide a check for the cash value of any fractional Share in such account. Upon termination of Plan participation for any reason, future Distributions will be distributed to the Shareholder in cash. 
 
 10. Amendment, Suspension or Termination by the Fund. The Board of Trustees may by majority vote amend any aspect of the Plan; provided that the Plan cannot be amended to eliminate a Participant s right to terminate participation in the Plan and that notice of any material amendment must be provided to Participants at least 10 business days prior to the effective date of that amendment. The Board of Trustees may by majority vote suspend or terminate the Plan for any reason upon 10 business days written notice to the Participants. 

11. Liability of the Fund. The Fund shall not be liable for any act done in good faith, or for any good faith omission to act, including, without limitation, any claims or liability (i) arising out of failure to terminate a Participant s account upon such Participant s death prior to timely receipt of notice in writing of such death or (ii) with respect to the time and the prices at which Shares are purchased or sold for a Participant s account. To the extent that indemnification may apply to liabilities arising under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of a particular state, the Fund has been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC and certain state securities commissioners, such indemnification is contrary to public policy and, therefore, unenforceable. 

12. Applicable Law. These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.
