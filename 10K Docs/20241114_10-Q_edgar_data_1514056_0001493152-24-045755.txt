CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Except
for any historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q contain certain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. This includes statements regarding our future financial position,
economic performance, results of operations, business strategy, budgets, projected costs, plans and objectives of management for future
operations, and the information referred to under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations. 

These
forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as may, will, 
 expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, believe, continue 
or similar terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These forward-looking statements are not historical
facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management s beliefs and certain assumptions
made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, you are cautioned that
any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions
that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable
as of the date made, expectations may prove to have been materially different from the results expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ from projections include, for example: 

our
 prospects, including our future business, revenues, expenses, net income, earnings per share, gross margins, profitability, cash
 flows, cash position, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, our targeted growth rate, our goals for future revenues
 and earnings, and our expectations about realizing the revenues in our backlog and in our sales pipeline;

 ability to successfully pursue strategic acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses;

disruption
 and costs resulting from extreme weather and destructive climate events;

and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). We cannot assure you that the forward-looking
statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to be

substantially the same rights and preferences as the TraQiQ Series B Rights to Acquire Common Stock. 

As
a result of the redomicile, all of TraQiQ s outstanding warrants were assumed by Titan and now represent warrants to acquire shares
of Titan s common stock. The redomicile increased the Company s authorized capital stock to total shares, consisting
of shares of common stock, par value per share, and shares of blank check preferred stock,
par value per share, of which shares were designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock . In connection

Going
Concern 

The
Company s consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are prepared using accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.
This contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of . The working capital of the Company was a deficit
of as of September 30, 2024. As a result of these factors, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements
are issued. The Company s consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty. 

The
Company s continuation as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to obtain additional financing and to generate
revenue and cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis. The Company will continue to seek to raise additional funding
through debt or equity financing during the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.
Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to
continue as a going concern. There is no guarantee the Company will be successful in achieving these objectives. 

. The Company monitors the cash balances held in its bank accounts, and as of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, did not have any concerns regarding cash balances which exceeded the insured amounts.

The
Company s Digester Segment also recognizes operating revenues from
its product sales, such as sales of digester equipment and parts. Performance obligations from product sales were satisfied at the point
in time when products were shipped to the customer, which is when the customer had title and control. Therefore, the Company s product
sale contracts had a single performance obligation (shipment of product). The Company primarily receives fixed consideration for sales
of products. When revenue was earned on digester equipment related services, such as management advisory fees and digester maintenance
and repair services, fees were recognized as the services were performed based on service milestones. The Company offered customers subscriptions
to software which aided in the use of its Digester products; software revenue was recognized over time for the course of the subscription.
For product sales, the Company invoiced its customers with standard 30-day payment terms without any significant financing terms.

acquisition date ). Pursuant to the terms of the Titan Merger Agreement, Merger Sub was merged with and into Titan Trucking on
the Titan acquisition date with Titan Trucking surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Titan Merger ).

reverse acquisition and given that Titan Trucking was a private company at the time of the Titan Merger and therefore its value was not
readily determinable, the fair value of the merger consideration was deemed to be equal to quoted market capitalization of the Company
at the acquisition date. The purchase consideration was as follows:

In

in the period following the Standard Acquisition. Dominic Campo and Sharon Campo each signed a consulting agreement (the Standard
Consulting Agreements with the Company. For the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred and , respectively,

Agreements. 

Contingencies 

From
time to time, the Company is involved in routine litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business. Currently, there is no litigation
pending against the Company that could materially affect the Company other than as follows: 

In
July 2022, a complaint was filed against Titan Trucking in the Circuit Court for Macomb County, Michigan for breach of contract. In
the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that Titan Trucking has breached a contractual agreement between Titan Trucking and the
plaintiff pertaining to the transport of certain non-hazardous solid waste or recyclables from plaintiff s transfer station to
the locations identified in the contract. The complaint sought unspecified damages, attorney and expert fees and other unspecified
litigation costs. Titan Trucking denied the claims of the plaintiff, and in May 2023, Titan Trucking filed amended counterclaims
against the plaintiff alleging that plaintiff breached the contractual agreement by preventing Titan Trucking s performance of
its obligations under the agreement by failing to, among things, provide the necessary volumes of materials for shipment and the
personnel sufficient to permit Titan Trucking to provide its services and by failing to pay certain invoices and to reimburse Titan
Trucking for equipment damaged by plaintiff s employees and for overweight trailer tickets. As of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, no accruals for loss contingencies had been recorded as the outcome of this litigation was neither probable nor
reasonably estimable. Subsequent to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, on October 25, 2024, Titan Trucking entered into a
mutual release with the plaintiff which discharges Titan Trucking and any and all of its executive officers, employees, experts, and
attorneys from the claims in this litigation and all other claims, demands, liabilities, causes of action, and damages, including
attorneys fees, sanctions, interest, costs, and expenses, whether known or unknown, through and including October 25,
2024. 

In
July 2023, a complaint was filed against us and Ajay Sikka, a director of our company and our former chief executive officer, in the
Circuit Court of the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Lake County, Illinois titled Alta Waterford, LLC v. TraQiQ, Inc. and Ajay Sikka (Case
No. 23LA00000476) for breach of contract. In the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that we breached contracts for the payment of compensation
for investor relations and web development and copyright services allegedly provided by the plaintiff, which payment obligation was personally
guaranteed by Mr. Sikka. 

The
complaint seeks damages in the amount of , attorney fees and other unspecified litigation costs. The Company answered the complaint,
denying all of the basic allegations, and the plaintiff then moved to strike the Company s answer. In December 2023, the parties
entered an agreement pursuant to which the plaintiff agreed to produce all of the documents supporting its claim that it performed services
under the contracts, and the Company agreed to serve and file an amended answer within 21 days after receipt of their documents. Since
that time, the plaintiff produced its documents and the Company filed its amended answer. 

In
May 2024, the Court signed a new order with an updated schedule. Consistent with that new order, the Company still anticipates conducting
deposition discovery in the weeks and months ahead, but the matter is now scheduled for a bench trial in Illinois (no jury) in May 2025.
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no accruals for loss contingencies have been recorded as the outcome of this litigation
is neither probable nor reasonably estimable. 

On May 31, 2024 (the Standard acquisition
date ), the Company completed a transaction to acquire Standard. Titan agreed to issue 
 shares of Series A as consideration and an additional 
 shares of Series A because Closing did not occur prior to February 2, 2024, for a total of 
 shares of Series A Preferred. The other 
 shares have not been issued to the Sellers yet because they are being held back to satisfy any indemnification claims made by
Titan, which is in accordance with the terms of the agreement. These will be released on the 12th month anniversary of the Closing, provided
there are no valid claims. 

The
Company believes that this structure reflects its current operational and financial management, and that it provides the best structure
for the Company to focus on growth opportunities while maintaining financial discipline. The factors used to identify the Trucking and
Digester operating segments were the difference in revenue streams and customer base for each segment, the reporting structure for operational
and performance information within the Company, and management s decision to organize the Company around the different revenue
generating activities of the segments. Total revenues for each reportable segment are as follows:

ITEM
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which
we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and judgments, including those described
in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

As
used in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, except where the
context otherwise requires, the term we, us, our, or the Company, refers to the
business of Titan Environmental Solutions Inc. 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine and three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, including the notes to those statements, appearing elsewhere in this report, as well as management s
discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023. This section and other parts of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Statements. 

Overview
of Our Company 

During
the periods covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we operated two distinct lines of business. The first is our Trucking
Segment, composed of Titan Trucking, LLC Titan Trucking ), and Standard Waste Services, LLC Standard ).
Titan Trucking and Standard are non-hazardous solid waste management companies providing waste and recycling collection and
transportation services for industrial generators, commercial contractors and transfer station operators in Michigan. Titan Trucking
and Standard maintain a fleet of roll off and tractor trailer trucks to perform their services. The Trucking Segment operates in a
highly recession resistant industry given the ongoing generation of waste and recyclable materials. The Trucking Segment s
goal is to provide our customers with safe and efficient options for the disposal and recycling of their waste streams. Titan
Trucking has begun to create the infrastructure needed to expand its operations organically and through strategic acquisitions and
market development opportunities across the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast regions of the United States. The second line of
business was our former Digester Segment, made up of Recoup Technologies, Inc., which, as discussed below, was sold on October 31, 2024 and provided technology enabled solutions for food
waste processing including onsite Digestors for food waste along with cloud-based software tracking and analytics
solutions. 

Sale
and of Subsidiary Recoup Technologies, Inc. Recoup 

On
October 31, 2024, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of October 31, 2024 (the Purchase Agreement among our company and our wholly-owned subsidiary Recoup, and Recoup Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
 Purchaser ), and consummated the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, including the sale of Recoup to
the Purchaser. Recoup is in the business of marketing an aerobic digestion technology solution for the disposal of food waste at the
point of generation. 

Pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser purchased from us all of the capital stock of Recoup for a purchase price equal to
 1,000,000, which consisted of a promissory note receivable to be paid by the Purchaser to us in the principal amount of 250,000
and the cancellation and release by certain affiliates of the Purchaser of our indebtedness obligations in the
aggregate amount of 750,000. We also agreed that, for a period of five years from the closing date, we will not
engage in a business that competes with the business of Recoup. 

Standard
Waste Services, LLC Business Combination 

On
May 31, 2024 (the Standard acquisition date ), we completed a transaction to acquire Standard. The total purchase
consideration in connection with the acquisition was approximately 16.1 million. The purchase price consisted of 4,652,500 of cash
(inclusive of a 652,500 cash deposit paid on January 8, 2024), the issuance of two note payables with an aggregate principal value of
 2,859,898, and the issuance of 612,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock valued at 8,568,000. 

Standard
is a provider of contracted commercial roll-off and front-load waste services, including dumpster compactor rentals, to customers principally
in Southeast Michigan. Standard provides services to both commercial and industrial customers. 

The
transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the results of Standard s operations
are included within the Trucking Segment for 2024. 

The
purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair
values at the date of acquisition on a provisional basis. The purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net identifiable
tangible and intangible assets acquired and, as such, the excess was allocated to goodwill.

Certain
estimated fair values for the acquisition, including goodwill, anticipated intangible assets, and property, and equipment, are not yet
finalized. The purchase price was preliminarily allocated based on information available at the acquisition date and is subject to change
as we complete our analysis of the fair values at the date of the acquisition during the measurement period not to exceed one year, as
permitted under ASC 805 . 

As
a result of the acquisition, we recognized a total of 13.9 million of goodwill within the Trucking Segment. Goodwill represents
the value expected to be created through new customer relationships for our company, access to new market opportunities, and expected
growth opportunities. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition is susceptible to future impairment charges. 

Reverse
Acquisition with Titan Trucking, LLC 

On
May 19, 2023, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Titan Merger Sub Corp. Merger Sub ), entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (the Merger Agreement ), with Titan Trucking, Titan 5, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company Titan
5 ), Titan National Holdings 2, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company Holdings ), Jeffrey Rizzo, an individual JR ), William McCauley, an individual WM , and, together with Holdings, Titan 5 and JR, the Sellers ),
and JR, as the Seller Representative, pursuant to which, Merger Sub was merged with and into Titan Trucking, with Titan Trucking
continuing as the surviving entity and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company (the Titan Merger ). 

For
U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Titan Merger qualified as a tax-free reorganization . Under the terms of the
Titan Merger Agreement, upon the closing of the Titan Merger, we issued to the Titan Trucking owners 630,900 shares of our now
designated Series A Preferred Stock. Concurrent to the Titan Merger, our then- chief executive officer and one of our directors
resigned from their respective positions and our current chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial
officer were appointed. Additionally, the new chief executive officer and chief operating officer were both appointed as directors
of our company. 

In
accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations , the Titan Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with Titan
Trucking being deemed the accounting acquirer of our company. Titan Trucking, as the accounting acquirer, recorded the assets and liabilities
of our company at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The historical consolidated financial statements of Titan Trucking have
replaced our historical consolidated financial statements with respect to periods prior to the completion of the Titan Merger with retroactive
adjustments to Titan Trucking s legal capital to reflect the legal capital of our company. We remain the continuing registrant
and reporting company. 

Titan
Trucking was deemed to be the accounting acquirer based on the following facts and circumstances: (1) the Titan Trucking owners owned
approximately 65 of the voting interests of the combined company immediately following the transaction; (2) the Titan Merger resulted
in significant changes to the combined company s board of directors; (3) the Titan Merger resulted in significant changes to the
management of the combined company. 

45 

We
accounted for the Titan Merger as a reverse acquisition using acquisition accounting. Because the Titan Merger qualifies as a reverse
acquisition and given that Titan Trucking was a private company at the time of the Titan Merger and therefore its value was not readily
determinable, the fair value of the merger consideration was deemed to be equal to the quoted market capitalization of our company at
the acquisition date. The purchase consideration was as follows: 

TraQiQ, Inc. market capitalization at closing 
 27,162,222 
 
 Total purchase consideration 
 27,162,222 

We
recorded all tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The following represents

Disposal
of TraQiQ Private Solutions, Inc Ci2i 

On
July 28, 2023, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, TraQiQ Solutions, Inc Ci2i ), and Ajay Sikka Sikka ),
a director and our former chief executive officer, entered into an Assignment of Stock Agreement (the Assignment Agreement ).
Under the terms of the Assignment Agreement, we assigned and transferred to Sikka all of our rights, title and interests in the issued
and outstanding equity interests of Ci2i in exchange for consideration of 1. We additionally assumed from Ci2i loans and short-term
debts valued at 209,587 plus fees and interest. Other than the liabilities assumed from Ci2i, the balance sheet amounts and operations
of Ci2i as of the date of sale were insignificant. 

Redomicile
as Titan Environmental Solutions Inc. 

Effective
January 10, 2024, we redomiciled from a California corporation into a Nevada corporation (the redomicile ). As
a result of the redomicile, our corporate name was changed from TraQiQ, Inc. to Titan Environmental Solutions Inc. The
individuals serving as our executive officers and directors as of the effective time of the redomicile continued to serve in such respective
capacities with Titan following the effective time of the redomicile. 

46 

Change
in Equity Instruments and Share Authorizations 

As
a result of the redomicile, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the redomicile was exchanged for
one share of Titan s common stock. Additionally, each share of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the redomicile was exchanged for one share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of Titan
(the Series A Preferred Stock ), which has substantially the same rights and preferences as the Series C Preferred Stock.
Each of our Series A Rights to Receive Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the redomicile was exchanged for one
Series A Right to Receive Common Stock of Titan, which has substantially the same rights and preferences as our original Series A Rights
to Acquire Common Stock. Each of our Series B Rights to Receive Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the redomicile
was exchanged for one Series B Right to Receive Common Stock of Titan, which has substantially the same rights and preferences as our
original Series B Rights to Acquire Common Stock. 

As
a result of the redomicile, all of our outstanding warrants were assumed by Titan and now represent warrants to acquire shares of Titan s
common stock. The redomicile increased our authorized capital stock to 425,000,000 total shares, consisting of 400,000,000 shares of
common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, and 25,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, par value 0.0001 per
share, of which 630,900 shares were designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock . In connection with the redomicile,
we also adopted the Titan Environmental Solutions Inc. 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. 

Change
in Trading Symbol of Common Stock 

Following
the redomicile and effective on January 16, 2024, the trading symbol of our common stock changed from TRIQ to
 TESI . 

Authorization of Reverse Stock Split 

On September 10, 2024, our board of directors was authorized to effect
a reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split on the basis of one share of our common stock for up to 100 shares of our
common stock, at an exact ratio at the discretion of the board of directors, at any time prior to September 10, 2025. In connection with
the Reverse Stock Split, if one is approved by our board of directors, our board of directors may also amend our articles of incorporation
to reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock to a number of shares, as determined by the board of directors, that is not
less than 110 of the number of outstanding shares of common stock on a fully-diluted basis after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split. 

Going
Concern 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 18,167,196. Our working capital was a deficit
of 16,344,202 as of September 30, 2024 (deficit of 10,935,108 as of December 31, 2023). As a result of these factors, management
has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year
after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. Our consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The Company s continuation as a going concern is contingent upon
its ability to obtain additional financing and to generate revenue and cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis. The Company
will continue to seek to raise additional funding through debt or equity financing during the next twelve months from the date of issuance
of these consolidated financial statements. Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide
the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. There is no guarantee the Company will be successful in achieving these
objectives.

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, our revenues increased by 2,731,814, or 49 , from
 5,568,224 to 8,300,038. The increase was primarily as a result of the acquisition of Standard on May 31, 2024, and the resulting
revenue generated by the combined operations of our company and Standard. The acquisition of Standard resulted in the expansion of
our Trucking Segment and our revenue from waste collection and sales. We also expanded the operations of the Trucking Segment with
the acquisition of new containers and other fixed assets which, as a result, increased the revenue generated during the period.
Additionally, expanded the sales operations of our Digester Segment which increased the revenue from product sales and related
product services. 

Cost
of Revenue 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, our cost of revenue increased by 2,469,245, or 52 , from
 4,703,784 to 7,173,029. The increase was primarily as a result of the acquisition of Standard on May 31, 2024, and the resulting
increased revenue caused by the combined operations of our company and Standard. We also have continued to expand the Trucking
Segment operations through acquisition of new containers and other fixed assets which also resulted in increased cost of
revenues. 

Operating
Expenses 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, our salary and salary-related costs increased by 375,360
or 32 , from 1,177,855 to 1,553,215. The increase was primarily due to the increased personnel costs associated with the
acquisition of Standard and increases to the operational activity of Recoup and Titan Trucking. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, our professional fees increased by 518,938, or 24 , from 2,131,902
to 2,650,840. The increase was attributed primarily to consulting, accounting and legal fees incurred due to our acquisition activities. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, our depreciation and amortization expense decreased by
 94,350, or 14 , from 674,879 to 580,529. Subsequent to September 30, 2023, we recognized the Titan Merger intangible assets at a
lower final value than compared to the Titan Merger preliminary values as a measurement period adjustment. As a result, the depreciation and amortization expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is lower than the depreciation and amortization expense from the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, our general and administrative expenses increased by 407,163,
or 60 , from 682,583 to 1,089,746. The increase was primarily due to our increased operational and sales activities, the addition of
leases, and the acquisition of Standard. 

Impairment of Intangible Assets 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and as a result of the
financial performance of the Digester Segment, the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible
assets were less than their carrying amount. Therefore, the Company performed an impairment assessment of the intangible assets. The quantitative
impairment test indicated the fair value of the intangible assets were lower than their carrying value, and as a result, the intangibles
were impaired with an impairment expense of 5,508,595 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Impairment
of Goodwill 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and as a result of the
financial performance of the Digester Segment, the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting
unit was less than it s carrying amount. Therefore, the Company performed an impairment assessment of the goodwill. The quantitative
impairment test indicated a fair value of the reporting unit that was lower than its carrying value, and as a result, the goodwill was
impaired with an impairment expense of 4,853,142 the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Due
to the reverse acquisition with Titan Trucking, we recognized goodwill of 26,880,916 for the Digester reporting unit on our consolidated
balance sheet. As a result of the historical net losses of the Digester Segment, we concluded it was more likely than not that the fair
value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount as of September 30, 2023. We performed an impairment assessment of the
goodwill. Our quantitative impairment test indicated a fair value of the reporting unit that was lower than its carrying value, and as
a result, the goodwill was impaired with an impairment expense of 15,669,287 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

On
the Titan Merger acquisition date, we awarded 70,100 shares of Series C Preferred Stock that vested immediately to our chief
executive officer, and as a result recorded 5,590,485 of stock-based compensation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
we and our chief executive officer signed a cancellation agreement and the shares of Series C Preferred Stock were rescinded.
There was no stock-based compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Interest
Expense, net of Interest Income 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, our interest expense, net of interest income increased by 2,088,018,
or 309 , from 676,726 to 2,764,744. The increase was due mainly to a large increase in debt instruments accruing interest on our consolidated
balance sheet as a result of the Titan Merger and the acquisition of Standard. Interest expense also increased due to our issuance and
sale of new debt instruments following the Titan Merger, as well as increased interest rates due to loans entering default. 

Sale of Customer Contracts 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 we recognized a gain on sale of customer contacts of 370,000. We sold two customer contracts in exchange for
total proceeds of 370,000, inclusive of debt cancellation of 220,000 and 50,000 of expenses paid on behalf of our company. 

Net
Loss 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, our net loss decreased by 123,988,674, or 87 from 142,155,870
to 18,167,196 due mainly to the decrease in loss on extinguishment of share rights, decreased stock based compensation, and decrease
in goodwill impairment expense. The decrease was offset by increased salaries and salary related costs, increased professional fees,
and increased general and administrative expenses.

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, our revenues increased by 1,276,452, or 49 , from
 2,606,653 to 3,883,105. The increase was primarily as a result of the acquisition of Standard on May 31, 2024, and the resulting
revenue generated by the combined operations of our Company and Standard. The acquisition of Standard resulted in the growth of our
Trucking segment and increased sales from waste collection and sales. We also expanded the operations of the Trucking Segment with
the acquisition of new containers and other fixed assets which, as a result, increased the revenue generated from waste collection
and sales. 

Cost
of Revenue 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, our cost of revenue increased by 1,484,175, or 76 , from

19 , from 559,208 to 453,174. The decrease was due to cost synergies that resulted from the acquisition of Standard as the Company was able to consolidate and reduce operational positions. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, our professional fees decreased by 586,947, or 49 , from 1,207,231
to 620,284. The decrease was attributed primarily to decreased consulting, accounting and legal fees incurred due to our acquisition
activities. 

For

 232,513, or 55 , from 426,337 to 193,824. Subsequent to September 30, 2023, we recognized the Titan Merger intangible assets at a
lower final value than compared to the Titan Merger preliminary values as a measurement period adjustment. As a result, the depreciation and amortization expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is lower than the depreciation and amortization expense from the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, our general and administrative expenses increased by 49,936,
or 19 , from 268,534 to 318,470. The increase was primarily due to our increased operational and sales activities, the addition of
leases, and the acquisition of Standard. 

Impairment of Intangible Assets 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, and as a result of the
financial performance of the Digester Segment, the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible
assets were less than their carrying amount. Therefore, the Company performed an impairment assessment of the intangible assets. The quantitative
impairment test indicated the fair value of the intangible assets were lower than their carrying value, and as a result, the intangibles
were impaired with an impairment expense of 5,508,595 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Impairment
of Goodwill 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, and as a result of the
financial performance of the Digester Segment, the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting
unit was less than it s carrying amount. Therefore, the Company performed an impairment assessment of the goodwill. The quantitative
impairment test indicated a fair value of the reporting unit that was lower than its carrying value, and as a result, the goodwill was
impaired with an impairment expense of 4,853,142 the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Company. 

Net
Loss 

For

to 13,554,283 mainly due to the decrease in loss on extinguishment and on issuance of share rights, decrease in stock based compensation
and decrease in professional fees. The decrease was offset by increased interest expense and the goodwill impairment. 

SEGMENT REPORTING 

Operating
segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by management,
namely the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM of an organization, in order to determine operating and resource allocation
decisions. By this definition, the Company has identified its COO as the CODM. Prior to October 31, 2024, we operated and reported
in two segments: Trucking and Digester. 

Trucking
Segment: The Trucking Segment generates service revenues and incurs expenses by transporting environmental and other waste for customers. 

Digester
Segment: The former Digester Segment, which we sold on October 31, 2024, primarily generated revenues and incurred
expenses through the production and sale of digester equipment to customers. The segment also generated revenue through
related services such as digester maintenance and software services. 

We
believe that this structure reflects its current operational and financial management, and that it provides the best structure for
us to focus on growth opportunities while maintaining financial discipline. The factors used to identify the Trucking and
Digester operating segments were the difference in revenue streams and customer base for each segment, the reporting structure for
operational and performance information within our company, and management s decision to organize our company around the
different revenue generating activities of the segments. Total revenues for each reportable segment are as follows:

Adjusted
EBITDA (Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measure) 

We
have included in this report Adjusted EBITDA, a measure of financial performance that is not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe that this
measure provides useful information to investors and include this measure in other communications to investors. 

For
this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-U.S. GAAP measure and
the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management and board of directors believe the non-U.S. GAAP
measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management and board of directors use the
non-U.S. GAAP measures. This non-U.S. GAAP measure should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable U.S. GAAP measures. 

We
define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest expense (net of interest income), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and
certain non-recurring and non-cash transactions such as goodwill impairments, stock-based compensation, and the change in fair value
of derivative liabilities. Our management believes that this presentation provides useful information to management and investors regarding
our core trends by providing a more direct view of the underlying costs and performance. In addition, management uses this measure for
reviewing our financial and operational results. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures reported by other companies. 

52 

We
do not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The
principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes certain expenses and income that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded
in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to inherent limitations as this metric reflects the
exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining Adjusted EBITDA. In order
to compensate for these limitations, management presents Adjusted EBITDA in connection with U.S. GAAP results. A reconciliation of net
loss to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

 of convertible notes and 75,263 of accrued interest were cancelled in exchange for 38,800,764 Series A Rights. On July 17, 2023, we
 also entered into Exchange Agreements with two accredited investors, including a director of our company, pursuant to which such
 investors exchanged 220,135 shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock into an aggregate of 22,013,500 Series A Rights.
 Additionally, 5,000,000 shares of our common stock and a payment of receivable owed by our company for unreimbursed advances in the
 amount of 100,000 were exchanged for an aggregate of 7,000,000 additional Series A Rights. On July 20, 2023, we entered
 into an Exchange Agreement with a shareholder pursuant to which the shareholder exchanged 14,118,233 shares of Common Stock and
 1,250,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for 108,729,363 Series A Rights and 30,388,873 Series B Rights. As a result of these
 exchanges, we recognized a loss of 116,591,322 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity
is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of September 30, 2024,
we had 75,573 in cash compared to 103,578 at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 28,005, resulting primarily from increased operating
activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,823,403 in accounts receivable compared to 970,629 at December 31, 2023, an increase
of approximately 852,774 primarily caused by the acquisition of Standard. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had total current assets of approximately 2.4 million and total current liabilities of approximately 18.7
million, or negative working capital of approximately 16.3 million, compared to total current assets of approximately 1.5 million and
total current liabilities of approximately 12.4 million, or negative working capital of 10.9 million at December 31, 2023. This is
a decrease in working capital of approximately 5.4 million over the working capital balance at the end of 2023 driven primarily by an
increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, an increase in convertible notes payable, an increase in related party notes payable,
and an increase in note payables. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had undiscounted obligations in the amount of approximately 10.6 million relating to the payment of indebtedness
due within one year. We anticipate meeting our cash obligations on our current indebtedness as of September 30, 2024, primarily through
the issuance of debt and equity securities, as well as through earnings from operations. 

Our
future capital requirements for our operations will depend on many factors, including the profitability of our businesses, the number
and cash requirements of other acquisition candidates that we pursue, and the costs of our operations. We plan to generate positive cash
flow from our Trucking Segment to address some of our liquidity needs. However, to execute our business plan, service our existing indebtedness,
finance our proposed acquisitions and implement our business strategy, we anticipate that we may need to obtain additional financing
from time to time and may choose to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings, a bank line of credit,
borrowings from affiliates or other arrangements. We cannot be sure that any additional funding, if needed, will be available on terms
favorable to us or at all. Furthermore, any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-linked securities may dilute
our current stockholders ownership in us and could also result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. The terms
of those securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors and may include the issuance of
warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect. Furthermore, any debt financing, if available, may
subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional
capital, when needed, to continue operations in their current form. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our capital expenditures were 1.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively. 

We
expect our capital expenditures for next 12 months will grow as we continue to expand the Trucking Segment s operational activity.
These capital expenditures will be primarily utilized for equipment needed to generate revenue and for office equipment. We expect to
fund such capital expenditures out of our working capital.

fund a net loss of approximately 18.2 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of approximately 13.4
million. Non-cash expenses were primarily made up of goodwill impairment of 4,853,142, intangibles impairment of 5,508,595,
amortization of debt discounts of 1,224,855, and depreciation and amortization of 1,212,177. Approximately 4.2 million of cash was generated from net changes in the levels of operating assets and
liabilities, primarily related to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, an increase in the right-of-use asset, a
decrease in accounts receivable, and a decrease in prepaid expenses. The cash generated was offset primarily by a decrease in the
operating lease liability and an increase in inventory. 

The
net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily used to fund a net loss of approximately
 142 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of approximately 139 million. Non-cash expenses were primarily

in the levels of operating assets and liabilities, primarily related to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, an increase
in accrued payroll and payroll taxes and an increase in the right of use asset. The cash generated was offset by an increase in accounts
receivable, a decrease in the operating lease liability, and an increase in prepaid expenses. 

Investing
Activities . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash used in investing activities was composed of approximately
 1,061,000 used for the acquisition of property and equipment and 4,652,500 of cash used to acquire Standard. The cash
used was offset by cash inflows of approximately 94,000 from the disposal of property and equipment. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our cash used in investing activities was compose primarily of approximately 174,000 used to
acquire property and equipment, offset by the net cash received as a result of the Titan Merger and the proceeds from the disposal of
property and equipment. 

Financing
Activities . There was approximately 6.2 million in cash generated from financing activities during the nine months ended September
30, 2024. This was primarily due to proceeds from notes payable of approximately 1,907,000, proceeds from the issuance of warrants of
 650,001, proceeds from related party note payables of 775,000, proceeds from convertible notes payable of 712,500, net proceeds from
the offering of Series B preferred stock of 4,222,000, and proceeds from related party convertible note payables of 63,000. Cash provided
from financing activities was offset by approximately 1,706,000 of repayments of notes payable, 290,000 of offering costs, and 140,000
of repayments of related party notes payable. 

There
was 2.7 million in cash generated from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due
to proceeds from convertible notes of 2.6 million, proceeds from notes payable related parties of 841,000 and proceeds from
convertible notes related parties of 500,000. Cash provided from financing activities was offset by approximately 1.2 million
of repayments of notes payable and 208,000 of repayments of notes payable related parties. 

55 

Non-Cash
Investing and Financing Activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we note that there was approximately 6.0
million of non-cash activity. The non-cash activity included investors exercising share rights into common stock for 1,266, and the
remeasurement of Series B Preferred Stock its redemption value of approximately 1,520,940. Additionally, Series A Preferred Stock was
issued to in relation to a guarantee agreement for 3,010,000 and a lease was terminated during the period resulting in a non-cash transaction
of approximately 1,129,000. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we note that there was approximately 27 million of non-cash activity related to the recapitalization
of equity due to the our reverse merger transaction. Additionally, we settled a note payable as a contribution to equity for 170,000. 

Cash
Payments for Interest and Income Taxes. We had approximately 797,000 and 276,000 of cash payments for interest expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were no cash payments for income taxes for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Those material accounting
estimates that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed
immediately below and are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the
application of significant judgment by our management to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain
estimates. 

Management
exercises judgment in making important decisions pertaining to choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies in many areas.
Not only are these decisions necessary to comply with GAAP, but they also reflect management s view of the most appropriate manner
in which to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in
Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 should be reviewed
for a greater understanding of how our financial performance is recorded and reported. 

During
the second quarter of 2024, there was a new class of Redeemable Preferred Series B Stock that was designated and treated as
mezzanine equity. Preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption, if any, is classified as a liability and is measured at fair
value. We classify conditionally redeemable preferred stock, which includes preferred stock that features redemption rights that are
either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our
control, as mezzanine equity. We subsequently measure mezzanine equity based on whether the instrument is currently
redeemable or whether or not it is probable the instrument will become redeemable. Given the assessed probability that the
instrument will become redeemable, we have elected to adjust the value of the Series B Preferred shares to its maximum
redemption amount at each reporting date, including amounts representing dividends not currently declared or paid, but which will be
payable under the redemption feature. There were no additional significant changes in
the manner in which our significant accounting policies were applied or in which related assumptions and estimates were
developed.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based
on an evaluation as of the date of the end of the period covered by this report, our chief executive officer and our chief financial
officer (collectively, our Certifying Officers conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based on that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, because of the disclosed material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this
report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our Certifying Officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon the evaluation of the disclosure
controls and procedures at the end of the period covered by this report, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as a result of continuing weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting principally due
to the following: 

- 
 We have not established
 adequate financial reporting processes or monitoring activities to ensure adequate financial reporting and to mitigate the risk of
 management override, specifically because there are few employees and only two officers with management functions and therefore there
 is lack of segregation of duties. 

- 
 An outside consultant assists
 in the preparation of the annual and quarterly financial statements and partners with us to ensure compliance with U.S. GAAP and
 SEC disclosure requirements. 

- 
 We did not maintain a sufficient
 complement of qualified accounting personnel and controls associated with segregation of duties over complex transactions. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended September 30, 2024 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

The
term internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the registrant s
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the registrant s
board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes
those policies and procedures that: 

(a) 
 Pertain to the maintenance
 of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the registrant; 

(b) 
 Provide reasonable assurance
 that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
 principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the registrant are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
 and directors of the registrant; and 

(c) 
 Provide reasonable assurance
 regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the registrant s assets that could
 have a material effect on the financial statements.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

There
have been no material developments in any of the legal proceedings discussed in Item 3 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023, except as follows: 

In July 2022, a complaint was filed against Titan Trucking in the Circuit
Court for Macomb County, Michigan for breach of contract. In the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that Titan Trucking has breached a contractual
agreement between Titan Trucking and the plaintiff pertaining to the transport of certain non-hazardous solid waste or recyclables from
plaintiff s transfer station to the locations identified in the contract. The complaint sought unspecified damages, attorney and
expert fees and other unspecified litigation costs. Titan Trucking denied the claims of the plaintiff, and in May 2023, Titan Trucking
filed amended counterclaims against the plaintiff alleging that plaintiff breached the contractual agreement by preventing Titan Trucking s
performance of its obligations under the agreement by failing to, among things, provide the necessary volumes of materials for shipment
and the personnel sufficient to permit Titan Trucking to provide its services and by failing to pay certain invoices and to reimburse
Titan Trucking for equipment damaged by plaintiff s employees and for overweight trailer tickets. As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, no accruals for loss contingencies had been recorded as the outcome of this litigation was neither probable nor reasonably estimable.
On October 25, 2024, Titan Trucking entered into a mutual release with the plaintiff which discharges Titan Trucking and any and all of
its executive officers, employees, experts, and attorneys from the claims in this litigation and all other claims, demands, liabilities,
causes of action, and damages, including attorneys fees, sanctions, interest, costs, and expenses, whether known or unknown, through
and including October 25, 2024. 

As
of September 30, 2024, no accruals for loss contingencies have been recorded as the outcomes of such litigations is neither probable
nor reasonably estimable.
