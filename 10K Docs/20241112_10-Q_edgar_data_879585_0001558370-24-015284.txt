 Contract Assets and Liabilities The Company recognizes contract assets and liabilities on its balance sheet. Contract assets represent unbilled amounts typically resulting from consumer Mobility contracts with both a multiyear service period and a promotional discount. In these contracts, the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. The current portion of the contract asset is recorded in prepayments and other current assets and the noncurrent portion is included in other assets on the Company s balance sheets. Contract liabilities consist of advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Mobility and Fixed revenue for postpaid customers is generally billed in advance and recognized over the period that the corresponding service is rendered to customers. To the extent the service is not provided by the reporting date the amount is recognized as a contract liability. Prepaid service, including Mobility services, sold to customers is recorded as deferred revenue prior to the commencement of services. Contract liabilities also include certain long term fixed business and carrier service customer contracts. The current portion of contract liabilities are recorded in advanced payments and deposits and the noncurrent portion is included in deferred revenue, long-term on the Company s balance sheets. In July 2019, the Company entered into a Network Build and Maintenance Agreement with AT T Mobility, LLC AT T that was subsequently amended through December 31, 2023 (the FirstNet Agreement ). In connection with the FirstNet Agreement, the Company is building a portion of AT T s network for the First Responder Network Authority in or near the Company s current operating areas in the western United States (the FirstNet Transaction ). The FirstNet Transaction includes construction and service performance obligations. The current portion of receivables under this agreement is recorded in customer receivable and the long-term portion is recorded in customer receivable long-term on the Company s balance sheet. In May 2023, the Company amended its current roaming agreement and entered into a carrier management services agreement with Verizon Wireless (the Verizon CMS Agreement ). The transaction includes service performance obligations under which revenue is recognized over time. The Company allocates the transaction price of these agreements to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is the estimated price the Company would charge for the good or service in a separate transaction with similar customers in similar circumstances. Contract asset noncurrent ) ) Contract liability current ) ) ) Contract liability noncurrent ) ) ) Net contract liability ) ) ) The decrease in the Company s net contract liability was due to the timing of customer prepayments, contract billings, and recognition of deferred revenue. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of million related to its December 31, 2023 contract liability and amortized million of the December 31, 2023 contract asset to revenue.

The Company expects to satisfy approximately of the remaining performance obligations and recognize the transaction price within and a p p r o x i m a t e l y million annually from 2026 through 2031. The Company has elected the practical expedient to exclude revenue related to contracts of less than one year, generally month-to-month contracts, and contracts with a fixed per-unit price and variable quantity, from the remaining performance obligation estimate. Disaggregation The Company's revenue is presented on a disaggregated basis in Note 13 based on an evaluation of disclosures outside the financial statements, information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision makers for evaluating the financial performance of operating segments and other information that is used for performance evaluation and resource allocations. This includes revenue from Communication Services, Construction, and Other revenue. Communication Services revenue is further disaggregated into business and consumer Mobility, business and consumer Fixed, Carrier Services, and Other services. Other revenue is further disaggregated into Managed Services revenue. Receivables The Company records an estimate of future credit losses in conjunction with revenue transactions based on the information available including historical experience and management s expectations of future conditions. Those estimates are updated as additional information becomes available. The Company s allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is based on management s assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk characteristics. The Company had gross accounts receivable of million and an allowance for credit losses of million as of September 30, 2024. In addition, the Company had receivables under the FirstNet Agreement totaling million, of which million was long-term.

 remains pending for determination by the High Court. In February 2020, the Company s Alaska Communications subsidiary received a draft audit report from USAC in connection with USAC s inquiry into Alaska Communications funding requests under the Rural Health Care Support Program for certain customers for the time period of July 2012 through June 2017. Alaska Communications also received a Letter of Inquiry on March 18, 2018, and subsequent follow up information requests, from the FCC Enforcement Bureau requesting historical information regarding Alaska Communications participation in the FCC s Rural Health Care Support Program. On May 8, 2024, the Company entered into a Consent Decree with the FCC Enforcement Bureau, regarding both the USAC and FCC Enforcement Bureau s investigation and agreed to (i) pay a settlement amount of approximately million, and (ii) enter into a compliance agreement in connection with Alaska Communication s continued participation in the RHC Program. At this time, the Company believes that it can comply with all of the terms of the compliance agreement. The settlement amount of million consists of a million cash payment and the million forgiveness of certain receivables, both of which have been accrued on the Company s balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. As such, this settlement will not impact the statement of operations in future periods. With respect to all of the foregoing unresolved matters, the Company believes that some adverse outcome is probable and has accordingly accrued million as of September 30, 2024 for these and other potential liabilities arising in various claims, legal actions and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company also faces contingencies that are reasonably possible to occur that cannot currently be estimated. It is the Company s policy to expense costs associated with loss contingencies, including any related legal fees, as they are incurred.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a leading provider of digital infrastructure and communications services with a focus on rural and remote markets in the United States, and internationally, including Bermuda and the Caribbean region. We have developed significant operational expertise and resources that we use to augment our capabilities in our local markets. With this support, our operating subsidiaries are able to improve their quality of service with greater economies of scale and expertise than would typically be available in the size markets we operate in. We provide management, technical, financial, regulatory, and marketing services to our operating subsidiaries and typically receive a management fee calculated as a percentage of their revenues, which is eliminated in consolidation. We also actively evaluate investment opportunities and other strategic transactions, both domestic and international, and generally look for those that we believe fit our profile of telecommunications businesses and have the potential to complement our First-to-Fiber and Glass Steel approach in markets while keeping a focus on generating excess operating cash flows over extended periods of time. We use the cash generated from our operations to maintain an appropriate ratio of debt and cash on hand to fund growth, capital expenditures, return cash to our stockholders through dividends or stock repurchases, and make strategic investments or acquisitions. For further information about our financial segments and geographical information about our operating revenues and assets, see Notes 1 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. As of September 30, 2024, we offered the following types of services to our customers: Mobile Telecommunications Services . We offer mobile communications services over our wireless networks and related equipment, such as handsets, to both business and consumer customers. Fixed Telecommunications Services . We provide fixed data and voice telecommunications services and related equipment, such as modems, to business and consumer customers. These services include consumer broadband and high-speed data solutions for businesses. For some markets, fixed services also include video services and revenue derived from support under certain government programs. Carrier Telecommunication Services . We deliver services to other telecommunications providers including the leasing of critical network infrastructure such as tower and transport facilities, wholesale roaming and long distance voice services, site maintenance and international long-distance services. Managed Services . We provide information technology services such as network, application, infrastructure and hosting services to both our business and consumer customers to complement our fixed services in our existing markets . Through September 30, 2024, we identified two operating segments to manage and review our operations and to facilitate investor presentations of our results. These operating segments are as follows: International Telecom . In our international markets, we offer fixed services, mobility services, carrier services and managed services to customers in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guyana and the US Virgin Islands. US Telecom . In the United States, we offer fixed services, carrier services, and managed services to

 business customers and consumers in Alaska and the western United States. As of September 30, 2024, we provided mobility services to retail customers in the western United States. The following chart summarizes the operating activities of our principal subsidiaries, the segments in which we reported our revenue and the markets we served as of September 30, 2024: 

International Telecom US Telecom Services Markets Tradenames Services Markets Tradenames Mobility Services Bermuda, Guyana, US Virgin Islands One, GTT, Viya, Brava Mobility Services United States (rural markets) Choice, Choice NTUA Wireless Fixed Services Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Guyana, US Virgin Islands One, Logic, GTT, Viya, Brava Fixed Services United States Alaska Communications, Commnet, Choice, Choice NTUA Wireless, Sacred Wind Communications, Ethos, Deploycom Carrier Services Bermuda, Guyana, US Virgin Islands One, Essextel, GTT, Viya Carrier Services United States Alaska Communications, Commnet, Sacred Wind Communications Managed Services Bermuda, Cayman Islands, US Virgin Islands, Guyana Fireminds, One, Logic, GTT, Viya, Brava Managed Services United States Alaska Communications, Choice Carrier Managed Services In July 2019, we entered into a Network Build and Maintenance Agreement with AT T Mobility, LLC AT T that we subsequently amended through December 31, 2023 (the FirstNet Agreement ). In connection with the FirstNet Agreement, we are building a portion of AT T s network for the First Responder Network Authority FirstNet in or near our current operating areas in the western United States. Pursuant to the FirstNet Agreement and subject to certain limitations contained therein, all cell sites must be completed and accepted within a specified period of time. Since the inception of the project through September 30, 2024, we have recorded 75.8 million in construction revenue and expect to record approximately 7.5 million in additional construction revenue and related costs as sites are completed. We expect to substantially complete the build by the end of 2025 with the remainder to be completed in 2026. Revenues from construction are expected to have minimal impact on operating income. Following acceptance of a cell site, AT T will own the cell site and we will assign to AT T any third-party tower lease applicable to such cell site. If the cell site is located on a communications tower we own, AT T will pay us pursuant to a separate lease agreement for an initial term of eight years. In addition to building the network, we will provide ongoing equipment and site maintenance and high-capacity transport to and from these cell sites for an initial term ending in 2031. On May 10, 2023, we entered into a Carrier Managed Services Master Agreement (the Agreement with Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless Verizon ), pursuant to which we will provide a variety of network, infrastructure and technical services that will help deliver next generation wireless services to Verizon s subscribers in our current operating area in the southwestern United States. Pursuant to the Agreement and subject to certain limitations contained therein, we will upgrade our wireless service in specific areas and provide services to Verizon for an initial term ending in 2030.

 Following acceptance of a cell site, we will continue to own the cell site. In addition to building the network, we will provide ongoing equipment and site maintenance and high-capacity transport to and from these cell sites for an initial term ending in 2030. With respect to each of our FirstNet and Verizon agreements, our carrier partners will continue to use our wholesale domestic mobility network for roaming services at a fixed rate per site during the construction period until such time as the cell site is completed. Thereafter, revenue from the maintenance, leasing and transport services provided is expected to generally offset revenue from wholesale mobility roaming services. Universal Service Fund and Other Domestic Funding Programs We recognize revenue from several government funded programs including the USF, a subsidy program managed by the Federal Communications Commission FCC ), and the Alaska Universal Service Fund AUSF ), a similar program managed by the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (the RCA ). USF funds are disbursed to telecommunication providers through four programs: the High Cost Program; the Low Income Program Lifeline Program the Schools and Libraries Program E-Rate Program and the Rural Health Care Support Program. Our International Telecom segment receives 5.5 million of legacy frozen high cost support funding in the US Virgin Islands. This funding expires on December 31, 2025. Additionally, we recognize revenue from the FCC s Affordable Connectivity Program ACP and the Emergency Connectivity Fund ECF ). The ACP provides eligible low-income consumers with a monthly subsidy for broadband connectivity and the ECF provides schools and libraries with subsidies for broadband connectivity. Funding under the ACP and ECF programs expired in the second quarter of 2024. We also recognize High Cost support revenue from the Connect America Fund Phase II program CAF II and the Enhanced Alternative Connect America Cost Model program E-ACAM ). These programs offer subsidies to carriers to expand broadband coverage in designated areas. Under CAF II, we expect to receive an aggregate of 27.7 million annually through December 2025 and an aggregate of 8.0 million annually from January 2026 through July 2028. Under E-ACAM, we expect to receive a total of 118.2 million over a 15 year period beginning in 2024. The annual E-ACAM funding is approximately 9 million from 2024 through 2030 and ultimately decreasing to over time 6 million in 2038. We were awarded approximately 22.7 million over 10 years to provide broadband and voice coverage to over 10,000 households in the United States (not including Alaska) under the 2020 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase I Auction RDOF ). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into agreements to transfer 13.0 million of RDOF obligations. The transfer applications are pending regulatory approval. All of the programs are subject to certain operational and reporting compliance requirements. We believe we are in compliance with these requirements as of September 30, 2024. Construction Grants We have also been awarded construction grants to build network connectivity for eligible communities. The funding of these grants, used to reimburse us for our construction costs, is generally distributed after we incur reimbursable costs. Completion deadlines begin in 2024 and once these projects are constructed, we are obligated to provide service to the participants. We expect to meet all requirements associated with these grants. As of September 30, 2024, we were awarded 100.1 million of construction grants. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we disbursed capital expenditures of 4.7 million under these programs and received reimbursement of 4.1 million. These cash flows are classified as investing activities in our statement of cash flows. In addition, we partner with tribal governments to obtain grants under various government grant programs including, but not limited to, the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program TBCP and the Rural Development Broadband ReConnect Program ReConnect ). These programs are administered by United States government agencies

 to deploy broadband connectivity in certain underserved areas. We were identified as a sub recipient of grants under these programs totaling 192.6 million as of September 30, 2024. Through September 30, 2024, we have received 15.9 million of funding under these programs and spent 16.1 million on construction obligations. These amounts are recorded as operating cash flows in the company s statement of cash flows. Replace and Remove Program On July 15, 2022, we were notified that we were an approved participant in the Federal Communication Commission s Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program (the Replace and Remove Program ), designed to reimburse providers of communications services for reasonable costs incurred in the required removal, replacement, and disposal of covered communications equipment or services, that have been deemed to pose a national security risk, from their networks. Pursuant to the Replace and Remove Program, we were allocated up to approximately 207 million in reimbursement amounts to cover documented and approved costs to remove and securely destroy all prohibited communications equipment and services in our U.S. networks and replace such equipment. The Replace and Remove Program requires that we complete the project no later than one year from submitting our initial reimbursement request, or by July 2024. In April 2024, the FCC granted our request to extend the program s completion deadline to the first quarter of 2025. At this time, we anticipate that we will be able to meet the deadlines and requirements of the program. We have incurred total expenditures of 139.9 million related to this project, of which 75.6 million were incurred in 2024. Of these total expenditures, 115.8 million were classified as capital. At September 30, 2024, 31.1 million of capital expenditures were accrued and unpaid. We expect to be reimbursed, within the next twelve months, for all amounts spent to date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we have received 87.2 million of reimbursement under the program, of which 18.7 million was classified as operating cash inflows and 68.5 million was classified as investing cash inflows in our statement of cash flows.

A comparison of our segment results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: International Telecom. Revenues within our International Telecom segment increased 0.4 million, or 0.4 , to 94.3 million from 93.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of an increase in Fixed revenues of 1.8 million, or 3.0 , to 61.8 million from 60.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase in Fixed revenues was primarily the result of network upgrades and expansions which led to an increase in the number of homes passed by high-speed data solutions which allowed us to migrate legacy copper customers to more durable and higher revenue generating fiber services. Partially offsetting the increase in Fixed revenues were decreases in both Mobility revenues, as a result of a decrease in subscribers, and Carrier Services revenues, primarily related to the amendment to certain carrier contracts. Operating expenses within our International Telecom segment increased by 0.3 million to 81.4 million from 81.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net increase was the result of an increase in marketing costs incurred in connection with the rebranding of our operations in a certain market partially offset by certain cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the current and previous periods. As a result, our International Telecom segment s operating income increased 0.1 million, to 12.9 million, from 12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. US Telecom . Revenue within our US Telecom segment decreased by 13.0 million, or 13.4 , to 84.2 million from 97.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of the conclusion of the Emergency Connectivity Fund during the second quarter of 2024.

 Operating expenses within our US Telecom segment increased 34.4 million, or 36.6 , to 128.5 million from 94.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of the 35.3 million goodwill impairment charge, 3.8 million of transaction-related expenses that were recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a 1.5 million loss on the transfer of certain assets. Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of certain cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the current and previous periods. As a result of the above, our US Telecom segment s operating income (loss) decreased by 47.3 million to a loss of 44.3 million from income of 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following represents a year over year discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

 Communications Services Revenue Mobility Revenue. Our Mobility revenue consists of retail revenue generated within both our International Telecom and US Telecom segments by providing retail mobile voice and data services over our wireless networks as well as through the sale and repair services of related equipment, such as handsets and other accessories, to our retail subscribers. Mobility revenue decreased by 1.2 million, or 4.2 , to 27.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 28.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Mobility revenue from consumer customers decreased by 2.4 million partially offset by an increase in Mobility revenue from business customers of 1.2 million. The net decrease in Mobility revenue, within our segments, consisted of the following: International Telecom . Within our International Telecom segment, Mobility revenue decreased by 1.0 million, or 3.6 , to 26.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 27.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the demand for prepaid voice services partially offset by an increase in the demand for data services. Mobility revenue from consumer customers decreased 2.2 million partially offset by an increase in Mobility revenue from business customers of 1.2 million. US Telecom. Mobility revenue within our US Telecom segment decreased by 0.2 million, or 22.2 , to 0.7 million from 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Substantially all of the decrease related to a decrease in revenue from consumers within our retail operations due to a reduction in subscribers as we continue to put more emphasis on other revenue sources within this segment. Mobility revenue within our International Telecom may decrease as a result of increased competition and regulatory changes partially offset by our continued network upgrades, marketing efforts and conversion of our current subscriber base to higher margin prepaid and postpaid plans. We expect that Mobility revenue within our US Telecom segment will decrease over time as we put more emphasis on other revenue sources within that segment. Fixed Revenue. Fixed revenue is primarily generated by broadband, voice, and video service revenues provided to retail and business customers over our wireline networks. Fixed revenue within our US Telecom segment also includes awards from the Connect America Fund Phase II program, the Enhanced Alternative Connect America Cost Model program, and the Alaska Universal Service Fund. In addition, and through early April 2024, Fixed revenue within the US Telecom segment also included revenue from the Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF) and Affordable Care Program (ACP). Within our International Telecom segment, Fixed revenue includes funding under the FCC s High Cost Program in the US Virgin Islands. Fixed revenue decreased by 5.5 million, or 4.6 , to 112.8 million from 118.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this decrease, revenue from business and consumer customers decreased by 5.4 million and 0.1 million, respectively. The net decrease in Fixed revenue, within our segments, consisted of the following: International Telecom . Within our International Telecom segment, Fixed revenue increased by 1.8 million, or 3.0 , to 61.8 million from 60.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this increase, 1.1 million and 0.7 million relate to increases in revenue from business and consumer customers, respectively. This increase was a result of network upgrades and expansions which led to an increase in the number of homes passed by high-speed data solutions which allowed us to migrate legacy copper customers to more durable and higher revenue generating fiber services.

 US Telecom . Fixed revenue within our US Telecom segment decreased by 7.3 million, or 12.5 , to 51.0 million from 58.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue from business and consumer customers decreased by 6.1 million and 1.2 million, respectively, primarily as a result of the conclusion of the Emergency Connectivity Fund and Affordable Care Program, both of which provided revenue through April 2024. Fixed revenue within our International Telecom segment may continue to increase as we continue to add subscribers to our fiber and fiber-fed data solutions deployed to expand and enhance our network reach. We expect the popularity of video and audio streaming, the demand for cloud services and smart home, business and city solutions to increase the demand for broadband and other data services from consumers, businesses and governments. However, such increases may be offset by a decrease in demand for our services due to subscribers using alternative methods to receive video and audio content. Within our US Telecom segment, we expect Fixed revenue to decrease in the short term as a result of the impact of the expiration of the Emergency Connectivity Fund and Affordable Care Program. Over time, we expect these decreases to be partially offset by increases in other business revenue in Alaska and our western United States operations as we further deploy fiber and fiber-fed broadband access to both consumers and businesses. Carrier Services Revenue. Carrier Services revenue is generated by both our International Telecom and US Telecom segments . Within our International Telecom segment, Carrier Services revenue includes international long-distance services, roaming revenues generated by other carriers customers roaming into our retail markets, transport services and access services provided to other telecommunications carriers. Within our US Telecom segment, Carrier Services revenue includes services provided under the FirstNet Agreement and Verizon Carrier Managed Services Agreement, wholesale roaming revenues, the provision of network switching services, tower lease revenue and other services provided to other carriers. Carrier Services revenue decreased by 3.1 million, or 8.7 , to 32.7 million from 35.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease, within our segments, consisted of the following: International Telecom. Within our International Telecom segment, Carrier Services revenue decreased by 0.1 million, or 2.9 , to 3.3 million, from 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of a decrease in roaming revenues in some of our international markets. US Telecom . Carrier Services revenue within our US Telecom segment decreased by 2.9 million, or 9.0 , to 29.4 million from 32.3 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of the transition of legacy roaming arrangements to carrier service management contracts. Within our International Telecom segment, Carrier Services revenue may increase if international travel increases. Such increases, however, may be partially offset by a decrease within our international long-distance business in Guyana as consumers seek to use alternative technology services to place long-distance calls. Within our US Telecom segment, Carrier Services revenue may increase as a result of recent carrier service management contracts. Other Communications Services Revenue. Other Communications Services revenue includes miscellaneous services that the operations within our International Telecom segment provide to retail subscribers and project-related revenue generated within both our International and US Telecom segments. Other Communications Services revenue decreased by 0.4 million, or 22.2 , to 1.4 million from 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024

Table of Contents 
 and 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of non-recurring project-related revenue being recognized within both our International Telecom and US Telecom segments, during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We expect that other communications services revenue will decline to previously reported levels as the project-related fiber deployment engineering services revenue, reported during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, is not expected to continue subsequent to the completion of that project. Construction Revenue Construction revenue represents revenue generated within our US Telecom segment for the construction of network cell sites related to the FirstNet Agreement. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Construction revenue decreased to 0.2 million from 2.0 million, respectively, as a result of a decrease in the number of sites completed during 2024 as compared to 2023. We expect to substantially complete the build by the end of 2025 with the remainder to be completed in 2026. Other Revenue Managed Services Revenue. Managed Services revenue is generated within both our International and US Telecom segments and includes network, application, infrastructure, and hosting services. Managed Services revenue decreased 0.6 million, or 13.6 , to 3.8 million from 4.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net decrease in Managed Services revenue, within our segments, consisted of the following: Within our International Telecom segment, Managed Services revenue decreased 0.2 million, or 14.3 , to 1.2 million from 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Within our US Telecom segment, Managed Services revenue decreased 0.4 million, or 13.3 , to 2.6 million from 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Managed Services revenue may increase in both our US and International Telecom segments as a result of our continued effort to sell certain Managed Services solutions to both our consumer and business customers in all of our markets . Operating Expenses Cost of communication services and other. Cost of communication services and other are charges that we incur for voice and data transport circuits (in particular, the circuits between our Mobility sites and our switches), internet capacity, video programming costs, access fees we pay to terminate our calls, telecommunication spectrum fees and direct costs associated within our managed services businesses. These costs also include expenses associated with developing, operating, upgrading and supporting our telecommunications networks, including the salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the development and operation of those businesses, as well as credit loss allowances and the cost of handsets and customer resale equipment incurred by our retail businesses. Cost of communication services and other decreased by 1.4 million, or 1.7 , to 79.0 million from 80.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net decrease in cost of communication services and other, within our segments, consisted of the following : International Telecom. Within our International Telecom segment, cost of communication services and other decreased 3.0 million, or 8.0 , to 34.4 million from 37.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This segment incurred a decrease in its cost of communication services and other expenses as a result of the impact of certain cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the current and previous periods and lower transport and termination costs.

 US Telecom . Cost of communication services and other within our US Telecom segment increased by 1.2 million, or 2.8 , to 44.5 million from 43.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Such increase was a result of an increase in transport and cell site costs partially offset by the beneficial impact of certain cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the current and previous periods as well as a reduction in the costs associated with the Emergency Connectivity Fund program which was terminated during the second quarter of 2024. Cost of communication services in both our International and US Telecom segments may decrease as a result of the ongoing cost reduction initiatives that commenced in previous periods but may be partially offset by future inflationary pressure. Cost of construction revenue. Cost of construction revenue includes the expenses incurred in connection with the construction of and the delivery to AT T of cell sites in accordance with our FirstNet Agreement. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of construction revenue decreased to 0.2 million from 2.0 million as a result of a decrease in the number of sites completed during 2024 as compared to 2023. We expect to substantially complete the build by the end of 2025 with the remainder to be completed in 2026. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits we pay to sales personnel, customer service expenses and the costs associated with the development and implementation of our promotional and marketing campaigns. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include salaries, benefits and related costs for general corporate functions including executive management, finance and administration, legal and regulatory, facilities, information technology and human resources as well as internal costs associated with our performance of due-diligence and integration related costs associated with acquisition activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 7.2 million, or 11.8 , to 53.6 million from 60.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The changes in selling, general and administrative expenses, within our segments, consisted of the following: International Telecom . Within our International Telecom segment, our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 1.4 million, or 4.8 , to 27.6 million from 29.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease was the result of the beneficial impact of certain cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the current and previous periods within most of our international markets partially offset by an increase in marketing costs incurred in connection with the rebranding of our operations in a certain market. US Telecom . Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased within our US Telecom segment by 3.3 million, or 13.2 , to 21.7 million from 25.0 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease, which was incurred in all of our US markets, was primarily related to certain cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the current and previous periods, including lower compensation costs and professional fees. Corporate Overhead. Selling, general and administrative expenses within our corporate overhead decreased by 2.6 million, or 37.7 , to 4.3 million from 6.9 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to certain cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the current and previous periods and a decrease in professional fees. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses in both our International and US Telecom segments, as well as our Corporate Overhead, may continue to decrease as a result of the ongoing cost reduction initiatives that commenced in previous periods but may be partially offset by future inflationary pressure. Stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation represents a non-cash expense related to the amortization of grants of equity awards to employees and directors. 

 52 

Table of Contents 
 Stock-based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1.8 million and 2.0 million, respectively. Transaction-related charges. Transaction-related charges include the external costs, such as legal, tax, accounting and consulting fees directly associated with acquisition and disposition-related activities and certain financing activities, and are expensed as incurred. Transaction-related charges do not include employee salary and travel-related expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or dispositions or any integration-related costs. We incurred 3.8 million of transaction-related charges in connection with the refinancing of our Alaska subsidiary debt during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a nominal amount during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Restructuring and reorganization expenses. In our efforts to advance our cost management actions to drive higher operating margins, we incurred certain reductions in force and contract termination costs totaling 2.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Of this amount, 0.3 million, 1.2 million and 0.8 million was incurred in the International Telecom segment, US Telecom segment and Corporate and Other segment, respectively. In connection with our repositioning of our legacy wholesale roaming operations in our US Telecom segment, we recorded a 4.6 million restructuring charge during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to the decommissioning of certain cell sites. Depreciation and amortization expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses represent the depreciation and amortization charges we record on our property and equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 2.9 million, or 8.4 , to 37.3 million from 34.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, within our segments, consisted primarily of the following: International Telecom . Depreciation and amortization expenses increased within our International Telecom segment by 4.0 million, or 27.8 , to 18.4 million from 14.4 million, for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Increases were incurred in certain of our international markets as a result of recent capital expenditures used to expand and upgrade our network operations. US Telecom . Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased within our US Telecom segment by 0.7 million, or 3.6 , to 18.7 million from 19.4 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated in recent periods. Corporate Overhead . Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased within our corporate overhead by 0.4 million, or 66.7 , to 0.2 million from 0.6 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated in recent periods. We expect depreciation and amortization expenses to increase in our International Telecom segment as a result of recent capital expenditures and decrease within our US Telecom segments as some of our tangible and intangible assets we acquired are now fully depreciated. Amortization of intangibles from acquisitions. Amortization of intangibles from acquisitions include the amortization of customer relationships and trade names related to our completed acquisitions. Amortization of intangibles from acquisitions decreased by 1.1 million to 2.0 million from 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in recent periods. 

 53 

Table of Contents 
 We expect that amortization of intangibles from acquisitions will decrease in future periods as such costs continue to amortize. Gain (loss) on disposition of assets and transfers . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a loss on the disposition and transfer of assets of 1.5 million primarily relating to the disposal of certain assets within our US Telecom segment. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a loss on the disposition of long-lived assets of 0.2 million within our US Telecom segment. Goodwill impairment. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we completed our impairment assessment for our US Telecom segment after identifying events that indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. These events included, the Company s continued shift away from wholesale roaming and retail operations towards carrier managed services and fixed broadband services, delays in completing significant network upgrade projects, the conclusion of certain government subsidy programs leading to slower consumer growth, and delays in enterprise sales and delivery. The combination of these events led to the reporting unit being unable to meet key financial and operational forecasted targets. As a result of that analysis, we recorded an impairment of 35.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 . Interest income. Interest income represents interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment balances. Interest income was 0.2 million and a nominal amount for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Such increase was the result of increased cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances. Interest expense. We incur interest expense on the 2023 CoBank Credit Facility, the 2022 and 2024 Alaska Credit Facilities, the FirstNet Receivables Credit Facility, the GTT Credit Facilities, the Sacred Wind Term Debt and the Viya Debt. In addition, interest expense includes commitment fees, letter of credit fees and the amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest expense increased to 12.7 million from 11.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as additional interest expense was incurred as a result of an increase in borrowings under our credit facilities. Interest expense may increase in future periods as a result of additional borrowings or an increase in interest rates. Other income (expense). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income (expense) was 0.6 million of expense primarily related to a loss on the extinguishment of the 2022 Alaska Credit Facility, as discussed below. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, other income (expense) was 0.2 million of income primarily related to gains from our noncontrolling investments. Income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 23.4 and 12.7 respectively. We recorded an income tax benefit of 12.0 million in relation to a pretax loss of 51.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily impacted by the following items (i) the mix of income generated among the jurisdictions in which we operate, (ii) net expense related to valuation allowances placed on certain deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realizable based 

 54 

Table of Contents 
 on the weight of positive and negative evidence and (iii) discrete items including a 0.8 million expense associated with sale of a partnership interest , and a 0.8 million expense for interest on unrecognized tax positions. We recorded an income tax benefit of 0.5 million in relation to a pretax loss of 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily impacted by the following items (i) the mix of income generated among the jurisdictions in which we operate, (ii) net expense related to valuation allowances placed on certain deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realizable based on the weight of positive and negative evidence and (iii) discrete item including a 0.7 million expense for interest on unrecognized tax positions. Our effective tax rate is based upon estimated income before provision for income taxes for the year, composition of the income in different countries, and adjustments, if any, in the applicable quarterly periods for potential tax consequences, benefits and/or resolutions of tax contingencies. Our consolidated tax rate will continue to be impacted by any transactional or one-time items in the future and the mix of income in any given year generated among the jurisdictions in which we operate. While we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could materially differ from our accrued positions as a result of uncertain and complex applications of tax law and regulations. Additionally, the recognition and measurement of certain tax benefits include estimates and judgments by management. Accordingly, we could record additional provisions or benefits for US federal, state, and foreign tax matters in future periods as new information becomes available. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax reflected an allocation of 6.8 million and 0.1 million of losses generated by our less than wholly owned subsidiaries for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax, within our segments, consisted of the following: International Telecom . Within our International Telecom segment, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax increased by 0.1 million, or 5.6 , to an allocation of 1.9 million of our less than wholly owned subsidiaries income from an allocation of 1.8 million of income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. US Telecom . Within our US Telecom segment, n et income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax decreased by 6.8 million to an allocation of losses of 8.7 million from an allocation of losses of 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of in creased losses, including the impact of the impairment of goodwill, at our less than wholly owned subsidiaries within this segment. Net loss attributable to ATN International, Inc. stockholders. Net loss attributable to ATN International, Inc. stockholders was 32.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. On a per diluted share basis, net loss per share was 2.26 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.31 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Such per share amounts were negatively impacted by accrued preferred dividends of 1.4 million and 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

A comparison of our segment results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 is as follows: International Telecom. Revenues within our International Telecom segment increased 6.4 million, or 2.3 , to 282.7 million from 276.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of an increase in Fixed Revenues which increased 6.8 million, or 3.8 , to 185.3 million from 178.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase in Fixed Revenues was primarily the result of network upgrades and expansions as well as improved customer care and marketing strategies which led to an increase in the number of homes passed by high-speed data solutions which allowed us to migrate legacy copper customers to more durable fiber services. Operating expenses within our International Telecom segment decreased by 9.3 million, or 4.0 , to 225.8 million from 235.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net decrease was the result of a 15.7 million gain on the disposition of long-lived assets, primarily real estate, and certain cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the current and previous periods partially offset by a 1.5 million charge for restructuring and reorganization costs as well as an increase in other operating expenses. As a result, our International Telecom segment s operating income increased 15.7 million, or 38.1 , to 56.9 million from 41.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. US Telecom . Revenue within our US Telecom segment decreased by 21.2 million, or 7.4 , to 265.8 million from 287.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of the 

 57 

Table of Contents 
 conclusion of the Emergency Connectivity Fund and Affordable Care Program, both of which provided revenue through April 2024. Operating expenses within our US Telecom segment increased 18.0 million, or 6.2 , to 308.7 million from 290.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of the 35.3 million goodwill impairment charge that was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as well as a 3.8 million increase in transaction-related expenses. Partially offsetting these increases was a 3.5 million decrease in the restructuring and reorganization expenses and the impact of certain cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the current and previous periods. As a result of the above, our US Telecom segment s operating loss increased by 38.6 million to 42.9 million from 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 respectively, as a result of the transition of legacy roaming arrangements to carrier service management contracts. Other Communications Services Revenue. Other Communications Services revenue increased by 2.3 million to 4.4 million from 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of non-recurring project-related revenue being recognized within our International Telecom and US Telecom segments, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Construction Revenue During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Construction revenue decreased to 2.6 million from 3.6 million, respectively, as a result of a decrease in the number of sites completed during 2024 as compared to 2023 . Other Revenue Managed Services Revenue. Managed Services revenue increased 0.8 million, or 6.6 , to 12.9 million from 12.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

US Telecom . Cost of communication services and other within our US Telecom segment increased by 1.6 million, or 1.2 , to 133.3 million from 131.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Such increase was primarily related to increases in transport costs as well as costs associated with the increase in project-related revenues. These increases, however, were partially offset by the beneficial impact of certain cost savings initiatives that commenced during previous periods as well as a reduction in the costs associated with the Emergency Connectivity Fund program, which was terminated during the second quarter of 2024. Cost of construction revenue. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of construction revenue decreased to 2.6 million from 3.6 million as a result of a decrease in the number of sites completed during 2024 as compared to 2023.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 11.5 million, or 6.2 , to 172.6 million from 184.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The changes in selling, general and administrative expenses, within our segments, consisted of the following: International Telecom . Within our International Telecom segment, our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 0.4 million, or 0.5 , to 85.5 million from 85.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease was the result of the beneficial impact of certain cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the current and previous periods within most of our international markets partially offset by an increase in marketing costs incurred in connection with the rebranding of our operations in a certain market. US Telecom . Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased within our US Telecom segment by 9.5 million, or 12.0 , to 69.7 million from 79.2 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease was primarily related to certain cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the current and previous periods. 
 Corporate Overhead. Selling, general and administrative expenses within our corporate overhead decreased by 2.3 million, or 11.7 , to 17.4 million from 19.7 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to certain cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the current and previous periods . 
 Stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 6.5 million. Transaction-related charges. We incurred 3.8 million of transaction-related charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Restructuring and reorganization expenses. In our efforts to advance our cost management actions to drive higher operating margins, we incurred contract terminations and reductions in force costs totaling 3.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Of this amount, 1.5 million, 1.1 million and 0.9 million was incurred in the International Telecom segment, US Telecom segment and Corporate and Other segment, respectively. In connection with our repositioning of our legacy wholesale roaming operations in our US Telecom segment, we recorded a 4.6 million restructuring charge during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to the decommissioning of certain cell sites. Depreciation and amortization expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 0.2 million, or 0.2 , to 107.2 million from 107.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, within our segments, consisted primarily of the following: International Telecom . Depreciation and amortization expenses increased within our International Telecom segment by 8.2 million, or 19.2 , to 50.8 million from 42.6 million, for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Increases were incurred in certain of our international markets as a result of recent capital expenditures used to expand and upgrade our network operations. US Telecom . Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased within our US Telecom segment by 6.2 million, or 10.0 , to 56.1 million from 62.3 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated in recent periods.

 Corporate Overhead . Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased within our corporate overhead by 1.7 million to 0.3 million from 2.0 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated in recent periods. Amortization of intangibles from acquisitions. Amortization of intangibles from acquisitions decreased by 3.6 million to 5.9 million from 9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in recent periods. Gain on disposition and transfer of assets . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a gain on the disposition of assets of 14.9 million. This gain is comprised primarily of a 15.5 million gain, mostly related to the sale of real estate within our International Telecom segment and a 0.5 million gain pertaining to the previously completed disposition of our renewable energy assets partially offset by a 1.5 million loss on the transfer of certain assets within our US Telecom segment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a loss on the disposition of long-lived assets of 0.4 million within our US Telecom segment. Goodwill impairment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed our impairment assessment for our US Telecom segment after identifying events that indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. These events included, the Company s continued shift away from wholesale roaming and retail operations towards carrier managed services and fixed broadband services, delays in completing significant network upgrade projects, the conclusion of certain government subsidy programs leading to slower consumer growth, and delays in enterprise sales and delivery. The combination of these events led to the reporting unit being unable to meet key financial and operational forecasted targets. As a result of that analysis, we recorded an impairment of 35.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest income. Interest income was 0.8 million and a nominal amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Such increase was the result of increased cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances. Interest expense. Interest expense increased to 36.6 million from 30.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as additional interest expense was incurred as a result of an increase in borrowings under our credit facilities. Other income (expense). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income (expense) was 1.1 million of expense primarily related to a loss on the extinguishment of the 2022 Alaska Credit Facility, as discussed below, losses on foreign currency transactions and expenses incurred for certain employee benefit plans. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, other income (expenses) was 2.6 million of income primarily related to gains from our noncontrolling investments. Income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 22.1 and 35.8 , respectively. We recorded an income tax benefit of 10.2 million in relation to a pretax loss of 46.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily impacted by the following items (i) the mix of income generated among the jurisdictions in which we operate, (ii) net expense related to valuation allowances placed on certain deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realizable based on the weight of positive and negative evidence and (iii) discrete items including a 2.4 million expense to associated with the gain on sale of land in a foreign jurisdiction, a 3.7 million benefit from the reversal of an unrecognized tax

 position due to a statute of limitations expiration, a 1.5 million expense to record an unrecognized tax position for the current year, 2.2 million expense for interest on unrecognized tax positions, and a 0.8 million expense associated with the sale of a partnership interest. We recorded an income tax benefit of 6.4 million in relation to a pretax loss of 17.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily impacted by the following items (i) the mix of income generated among the jurisdictions in which we operate, (ii) net expense related to valuation allowances placed on certain deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realizable based on the weight of positive and negative evidence and (iii) discrete items including a 4.0 million benefit from the reversal of an unrecognized tax position due to a statute of limitations expiration, and a 2.0 million expense for interest on unrecognized tax positions. Our effective tax rate is based upon estimated income before provision for income taxes for the year, composition of the income in different countries, and adjustments, if any, in the applicable quarterly periods for potential tax consequences, benefits and/or resolutions of tax contingencies. Our consolidated tax rate will continue to be impacted by any transactional or one-time items in the future and the mix of income in any given year generated among the jurisdictions in which we operate. While we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could materially differ from our accrued positions as a result of uncertain and complex applications of tax law and regulations. Additionally, the recognition and measurement of certain tax benefits include estimates and judgments by management. Accordingly, we could record additional provisions or benefits for US federal, state, and foreign tax matters in future periods as new information becomes available. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax reflected an allocation of 6.1 million of income and 2.7 million of losses generated by our less than wholly owned subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax, within our segments, consisted of the following: International Telecom . Within our International Telecom segment, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax increased by 2.8 million, or 49.1 , to an allocation of 8.5 million of income from an allocation of 5.7 million of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, largely as a result of the 15.5 million gain we recorded on the disposition of assets, primarily real estate, and increased profitability at certain less than wholly owned subsidiaries. US Telecom . Within our US Telecom segment, n et income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax decreased by 6.1 million to an allocation of losses of 14.5 million from an allocation of losses of 8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of in creased losses, including the impact of the an impairment of goodwill, at our less than wholly owned subsidiaries within this segment . Net loss attributable to ATN International, Inc. stockholders. Net loss attributable to ATN International, Inc. stockholders was 30.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. On a per diluted share basis, net loss was 2.24 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a loss of 0.80 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Such per share amounts were negatively impacted by accrued preferred dividends of 4.2 million and 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively .

 Regulatory and Tax Issues We are involved in a number of regulatory and tax proceedings. A material and adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and future operations. For discussion of ongoing proceedings, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report . Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, we have met our operational liquidity needs and have funded our capital expenditures and acquisitions through a combination of cash-on-hand, internally generated funds, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from dispositions, and seller financings. We believe our current cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and availability under our current credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months for working capital and capital expenditure requirements. Total liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 116.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Of this amount, 45.8 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries and is indefinitely invested outside the United States. In addition, we had approximately 568.9 million of debt, net of unamortized deferred financing costs, as of September 30, 2024. How and when we deploy our balance sheet capacity, including the availability under our various credit facilities (as further described below), will figure prominently in our longer-term growth prospects and stockholder returns. Uses of Cash Acquisitions and investments. We have historically funded our acquisitions with a combination of cash-on-hand, borrowings under our credit facilities as well as equity investor and seller financings. We continue to explore opportunities to expand our telecommunications business or acquire new businesses in the United States, the Caribbean and elsewhere. Such acquisitions may require external financing. While there can be no assurance as to whether, when or on what terms we will be able to acquire any such businesses or make such investments, such acquisitions may be completed through the issuance of shares of our capital stock, payment of cash or incurrence of additional debt. From time to time, we may raise capital ahead of any definitive use of proceeds to allow us to move more quickly and opportunistically if an attractive investment materializes. Cash used in investing activities. Cash used in investing activities decreased by 58.2 million to 66.4 million from 124.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This year-over-year decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of a 56.5 million increase in cash inflows related to the reimbursements of capital expenditures under certain government programs and the 2024 sale of certain assets, primarily within our International Telecom segment, which generated 18.7 million in cash proceeds. These amounts were partially offset by the increase in cash outflows for capital expenditures, including reimbursable amounts, of 16.6 million. Working Capital. Historically, we have internally funded our working capital needs. Pursuant to the FirstNet Agreement, AT T has the option to repay construction costs, with interest, over an eight-year period. To fund the working capital needs created by AT T s option to extend its payment terms, we completed the Receivables Credit Facility, as discussed below, on March 26, 2020.

 Capital expenditures. Historically, a significant use of our cash has been for capital expenditures to expand and upgrade our telecommunications networks and business support systems. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we spent approximately 85.7 million for capital expenditures, net of 71.8 million of capital expenditures that are reimbursable under certain government programs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we spent approximately 126.6 million for capital expenditures, net of 14.3 million of capital expenditures that are reimbursable under certain government programs. The following notes our capital expenditures, by operating segment, for these periods (in thousands): 

Capital Expenditures International US Corporate and Nine months ended September 30, Telecom Telecom Other (1) Consolidated 2024 39,440 116,220 1,861 157,521 2023 57,610 83,291 140,901 
 (1) Corporate and other items refer to corporate overhead costs and consolidating adjustments. 
 We are continuing to invest in our telecommunication networks along with our operating and business support systems in many of our markets. For the year ended December 31, 2024, such investments are expected to total approximately 100 million to 110 million, net of reimbursable amounts, and will primarily relate to network expansion and upgrades which are expected to further drive subscriber and revenue growth in future periods. Income taxes. We have historically used cash-on-hand to make payments for income taxes. Our policy is to allocate capital where we believe we will get the best returns and to date has been to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. As we continue to reinvest our remaining foreign earnings, no additional provision for income taxes has been made on the accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Dividends. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Board of Directors declared 11.0 million of dividends to our stockholders which includes a 0.24 per share dividend declared on September 19, 2024 and paid on October 4, 2024. We have declared quarterly dividends since the fourth quarter of 1998. Stock Repurchase Plan. On December 14, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 25.0 million of our common stock, from time to time, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions (the 2023 Repurchase Plan ). As of September 30, 2024, we had 15.0 million available to repurchase shares of our common stock under the 2023 Repurchase Plan. We did not repurchase any of our common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and repurchased 4.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. We repurchased 10.0 million and 11.7 million of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Sources of Cash Cash provided by operations. Cash provided by operating activities was 97.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 89.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to an increase in net income which, excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge and transaction-related charges that were recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 14.4 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was 23.5 million and 48.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities of 25.0 million was primarily the result of an increase in cash used for debt repayments, net of borrowings, of 21.7 million, an increase in cash used to pay debt issuance costs of 2.8 million and an increase in cash used for the payment of dividends to our common stockholders of 1.1 million. These increases in cash used for

 financing activities was partially offset by a decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock (including shares repurchased from employees and directors to satisfy certain tax withholding obligations) of 1.2 million . 2023 CoBank Credit Facility On July 13, 2023, we, along with certain of our subsidiaries as guarantors, entered into a new Credit Agreement with CoBank, ACB and a syndicate of other lenders (as may be amended from time to time, the 2023 CoBank Credit Facility ). On July 10, 2024, we amended our credit facility to add certain subsidiaries as guarantors and to provide further flexibility to take on certain grant and government program obligations. The 2023 CoBank Credit Facility provides for a five-year 170 million revolving credit facility (the 2023 CoBank Revolving Loan and a six-year 130 million term loan facility (the 2023 CoBank Term Loan ). We may use (i) up to 25 million under the 2023 CoBank Credit Facility for letters of credit, and (ii) up to 20 million under a swingline sub-facility. Upon the closing of the 2023 CoBank Credit Facility, we drew all of the 2023 CoBank Term Loan and approximately 13.6 million of the 2023 CoBank Revolving Loan. These borrowings were used to repay 139.5 million of debt outstanding under the 2019 CoBank Credit Facility at close. The 2023 CoBank Term Loan must be repaid in quarterly principal payments in the amounts set forth below, with the outstanding principal balance maturing on July 13, 2029. The 2023 CoBank Revolving Loan may be repaid at any time on or prior to its maturity on July 13, 2028. All amounts outstanding under the 2023 CoBank Credit Facility will be due and payable upon the earlier of the maturity date or the acceleration of the loans and commitments upon an event of default.

The base rate is equal to the higher of (i) 1.00 plus the one-month SOFR rate (ii) the federal funds effective rate (as defined in the 2023 CoBank Credit Agreement) plus 0.50 per annum; and (iii) the prime rate (as defined in the 2023 CoBank Credit Agreement). The applicable margin is determined based on the ratio (as further defined in the 2023 CoBank Credit Agreement) of our maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio. Under the terms of the 2023 CoBank Credit Agreement, we must also pay a fee ranging from 0.25 to 0.50 on the average daily unused portion of the 2023 CoBank Credit Facility over each calendar quarter. The 2023 CoBank Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant (as further defined in the 2023 CoBank Credit Agreement) that imposes a maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio, as well as customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting additional indebtedness, liens, guaranties, mergers and consolidations, substantial asset sales, investments and loans, sale and leasebacks, transactions with affiliates and fundamental changes. The maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio is measured each fiscal quarter and is required to be less than or equal to 3.25 to 1.0. The 2023 CoBank Credit Agreement provides for events of default customary for credit facilities of this type, including but not limited to non-payment, defaults on other debt, misrepresentation, breach of covenants, representations and warranties, insolvency and bankruptcy. We capitalized 4.5 million of fees associated with the 2023 CoBank Credit Facility which are being amortized over the life of the debt and 3.5 million were unamortized as of September 30, 2024.

Additionally, the 2024 Alaska Credit Agreement includes certain customary conditions that must be met for the Borrower to borrow under the 2024 Alaska Credit Agreement from time to time. 2022 Alaska Credit Facility On December 23, 2022, Alaska Communications entered into a Credit Agreement (the 2022 Alaska Credit Facility with Fifth Third Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, and a syndicate of lenders to provide a Revolving Credit Commitment of 75.0 million (the 2022 Alaska Revolving Facility and Term Loan Commitment of 230.0 million (the 2022 Alaska Term Loan ).

 of principal commenced on March 31, 2023. The Alaska Term Facility was repaid in full during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Alaska Interest Rate Swap Agreements In November 2023, Alaska Communications entered into two forward starting 1-month floating to fixed SOFR interest rate swap agreements.

The swap agreements had an aggregate fair value of (1.3) and (1.2) million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. FirstNet Receivables Credit Facility On March 26, 2020, Commnet Finance, a wholly owned subsidiary of Commnet Wireless, entered into a receivables credit facility with us, Commnet Wireless, and CoBank, ACB (the Receivables Credit Facility ). The Receivables Credit Facility provides for a senior secured delayed draw term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to 75.0 million and the proceeds may be used to acquire certain receivables from Commnet Wireless. The receivables to be financed and sold under the Receivables Credit Facility, which provide the loan security, relate to the obligations of AT T under the FirstNet Agreement.

 Sacred Wind Term Debt In connection with the Sacred Wind acquisition completed on November 7, 2022, we assumed 31.6 million of term debt (the Sacred Wind Term Debt with the United States of America acting through the Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service RUS ). The loan agreements are dated as of October 23, 2006 and March 17, 2016. RUS provides financial assistance in the form of loans under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to furnish or improve telecommunications and/or broadband services in rural areas. The Sacred Wind Term Debt is secured by substantially all assets of Sacred Wind and an underlying mortgage to the United States of America. These mortgage notes are to be repaid in equal monthly installments covering principal and interest beginning after date of issue and expiring by 2035. The Sacred Wind Term Debt contains certain restrictions on the declaration or payment of dividends, redemption of capital stock or investment in affiliated companies without the consent by the RUS noteholders. The agreements also contain a financial covenant which Sacred Wind was not in compliance with as of December 31, 2021. Sacred Wind submitted a corrective action plan to comply with the financial covenant as of December 31, 2025. On May 5, 2022, Sacred Wind s corrective action plan was accepted by the RUS. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with that corrective action plan. As of September 30, 2024, 25.8 million was outstanding under the Sacred Wind Term Debt. Of that amount, 3.4 million was current and 22.4 million was long term. The mortgage notes carry fixed interest rates ranging from 0.88 to 5.0 . Viya Debt We, and certain of our subsidiaries, have entered into a 60.0 million loan agreement (the Viya Debt with Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative RTFC ). The Viya Debt agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sale of assets and liens) and a financial covenant that limits the maximum ratio of indebtedness to annual operating cash flow to 3.5 to 1.0 (the Net Leverage Ratio ). This covenant is tested on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year. Interest is paid quarterly at a fixed rate of 4.0 per annum and principal repayment is not required until maturity on July 1, 2026. Prepayment of the Viya Debt may be subject to a fee under certain circumstances. The debt is secured by certain assets of the Viya subsidiaries and is guaranteed by us. We paid a fee of 0.9 million in 2016 to lock the interest rate at 4 per annum over the term of the Viya Debt. The fee was recorded as a reduction to the Viya Debt carrying amount and is being amortized over the life of the loan. As of September 30, 2024, 60.0 million of the Viya Debt remained outstanding and 0.2 million of the rate lock fee was unamortized. On May 5, 2022, RTFC agreed to amend the Net Leverage Ratio to 7.0 to 1.0 through the maturity date of July 1, 2026. The Ratio is tested annually, and we were in compliance with the Net Leverage Ratio as of December 31, 2023.

The key factors affecting our internally generated funds are demand for our services, competition, regulatory developments, economic conditions in the markets where we operate our businesses and industry trends within the telecommunications industry. Restrictions under Credit Facility. Our 2023 CoBank Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting additional indebtedness, liens, guaranties, mergers and consolidations, substantial asset sales, investments and loans, sale and leasebacks, transactions with affiliates and fundamental changes. In addition, the 2023 CoBank Credit Facility contains a financial covenant that imposes a maximum ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the 2023 CoBank Credit Facility. Capital markets. Our ability to raise funds in the capital markets depends on, among other things, general economic conditions, the conditions of the telecommunications industry, our financial performance, the state of the capital markets and our compliance with SEC requirements for the offering of securities. In August 2022, we filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the SEC, to register potential future offerings of up to 300 million of our securities. Foreign Currency We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional currencies, primarily the Guyana Dollar, to US Dollars at the appropriate rates as of the balance sheet date. Changes in the carrying value of these assets and liabilities attributable to fluctuations in rates are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet. Income statement accounts are translated using the monthly average exchange rates during the year. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from a reporting entity s functional currency must first be remeasured from the applicable currency to the legal entity s functional currency. The effect of this remeasurement process is reported in other income within our income statement. During each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded 0.1 million and 0.3 million, respectively, in losses on foreign currency transactions. During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded 0.6 million and 0.9 million, respectively, in losses on foreign currency transactions. We will continue to assess the impact of our exposure to the Guyana Dollar.

 Inflation Several of our markets have experienced an increase in operating costs, some of which we believe, is attributable to inflation. If inflation continues or worsens, it could negatively impact our Company by increasing our operating expenses. Inflation may lead to cost increases in multiple areas across our business, for example, rises in the prices of raw materials and manufactured goods, increased energy rates, as well as increased wage pressures and other expenses related to our employees. In particular, where we have agreed to undertake infrastructure build-outs on a fixed budget for our carrier customers or by accepting government grants, inflation may result in build costs that exceed our original budget given the long delays experienced in procuring equipment and materials due to global supply chain delays. To the extent that we are unable to pass on these costs through increased prices, revised budget estimates, or offset them in other ways, they may impact our financial condition and cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncement s Refer to Note 2. Critical Accounting Estimates There were no changes to critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Translation and Remeasurement. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional currencies, primarily the Guyana Dollar, to US Dollars at the appropriate rates as of the balance sheet date. Changes in the carrying value of these assets and liabilities attributable to fluctuations in rates are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet. Income statement accounts are translated using the monthly average exchange rates during the year. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from a reporting entity s functional currency must first be remeasured from the applicable currency to the legal entity s functional currency. The effect of this remeasurement process is reported in other income on our consolidated statements of operations. Employee Benefit Plans. We sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans for employees of certain subsidiaries. Net periodic pension expense is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. We recognize a pension or other postretirement plan s funded status as either an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheets. Actuarial gains and losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive income and amortized through other income in subsequent periods. Interest Rate Sensitivity. As of September 30, 2024, we had 245.9 million of variable rate debt outstanding, which is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Our interest expense may be affected by changes in interest rates. We believe that a 100-basis-point change in the interest rates on our variable rate debt would result in a 2.5 million change in our annual interest expense. We may have additional exposure to fluctuations in interest rates if we again borrow amounts under our revolver loans within our credit facilities.

 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), mean controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings See Note 14 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described herein and in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results . Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer On December 14, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 25.0 million of our common stock, from time to time, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions (the 2023 Repurchase Plan ). We did not repurchase any of our common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and have 15.0 million available to be repurchased under the 2023 Repurchase Plan as of September 30, 2024.
