ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 National Beverage Corp. innovatively refreshes America with a distinctive portfolio of sparkling waters, juices, energy drinks (Power+ Brands) and, to a lesser extent, carbonated soft drinks. We believe our creative product designs, innovative packaging and imaginative flavors, along with our corporate culture and philosophy, make National Beverage unique as a stand-alone entity in the beverage industry. 
 
 The majority of our brands are geared to the active and health-conscious consumer including sparkling waters, energy drinks and juices. Our portfolio of Power+ Brands includes LaCroix , LaCroix C rate , and LaCroix NiCola sparkling water beverages; Clear Fruit non-carbonated water beverages enhanced with fruit flavor; Rip It energy drinks and shots; and Everfresh , Everfresh Premier Varietals and Mr. Pure 100 juice and juice-based beverages. Additionally, we produce and distribute carbonated soft drinks including Shasta and Faygo , iconic brands whose consumer loyalty spans more than 135 years. 
 
 Our strategy seeks the profitable growth of our products by (i) developing healthier beverages in response to the global shift in consumer buying habits and tailoring our beverage portfolio to the preferences of a diverse mix of crossover consumers a growing group desiring a healthier alternative to artificially sweetened and high-caloric beverages; (ii) emphasizing unique flavor development and variety throughout our brands that appeal to multiple demographic groups; (iii) maintaining points of difference through innovative marketing, packaging and consumer engagement and (iv) responding faster and more creatively to changing consumer trends than larger competitors who are burdened by legacy production and distribution complexity and costs. 
 
 Presently, our primary market focus is the United States and Canada. Certain of our beverages are also distributed on a limited basis in other countries and options to expand distribution to other regions are being pursued. To service a diverse customer base that includes numerous national retailers, as well as thousands of smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts, we utilize a hybrid distribution system consisting of warehouse and direct-store delivery. The warehouse delivery system allows our retail partners to further maximize their assets by utilizing their ability to pick up beverages at our warehouses, further lowering their/our costs. 
 
 Our operating results are affected by numerous factors, including fluctuations in the costs of raw materials, supply chain disruptions, holiday and seasonal programming, and weather conditions. Beverage sales are seasonal with higher sales volume realized during the summer months when outdoor activities are more prevalent. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Three Months Ended October 26, 2024 (second quarter of fiscal 2025) compared to 
 Three Months Ended October 28, 2023 (second quarter of fiscal 2024) 
 
 Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased 3.0 to 291.2 million compared to 300.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in sales resulted primarily from a 4.6 decrease in case volume, partially offset by a 2.2 increase in average selling price per case. The decrease in case volume impacted both Power + Brands and carbonated soft drink brands.

Table of Contents 

Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased to 109.4 million compared to 107.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to a decline in certain packaging costs and an increase in average selling price per case, partially offset by the decrease in case volume. The average cost of sales per case decreased 0.3 and gross margin increased to 37.6 compared to 35.9 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased 2.1 million to 51.5 million from 53.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in marketing and shipping and handling costs. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 17.7 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 17.8 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 

Other income, net includes interest income of 1.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in interest income is due primarily to lower average invested balances. 
 
 The Company s effective income tax rate, based upon estimated annual income tax rates, was 23.4 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 23.2 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The difference between the effective rate and the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the effects of state income taxes. 
 
 Six Months Ended October 26, 2024 (first six months of fiscal 2025) compared to 
 Six Months Ended October 28, 2023 (first six months of fiscal 2024) 
 
 Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2025 decreased 0.6 to 620.7 million from 624.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024. The decrease in sales resulted primarily from a 1.8 decrease in case volume, partially offset by a 1.4 increase in average selling price per case. The decrease in case volume impacted both Power+ Brands and carbonated soft drink brands. 
 
 Gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased to 231.8 million from 222.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to a decline in certain packaging costs and an increase in average selling price per case, partially offset by the decrease in case volume. The average cost of sales per case decreased 1.2 and gross margin increased to 37.3 compared to 35.6 for the first six months of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first six months of fiscal 2025 decreased 0.5 million to 104.4 million from 104.9 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in marketing and shipping and handling costs. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses remained at 16.8 for both of the first six months of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. 
 
 Other income, net includes interest income of 6.0 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 4.0 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024. The increase in interest income is due to increased average invested balances and higher yields.

Table of Contents 

The Company s effective income tax rate, based upon estimated annual income tax rates, was 23.3 for the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 23.5 for the first six months of fiscal 2024. The difference between the effective rate and the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the effects of state income taxes. 

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash-equivalents, cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity. At October 28, 2024, we maintained unsecured credit facilities totaling 150 million, under which no borrowings were outstanding and 2.2 million was reserved for standby letters of credit. We believe existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the next twelve months. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The Company s cash position decreased 214.2 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to an increase of 89.6 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024 primarily due to the special cash dividend of 304.1 million paid on July 24, 2024. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was 100.1 million compared to 102.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024. For the first six months of fiscal 2025, cash flow provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to increases in working capital excluding cash, partially offset by an increase in net income. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the first six months of fiscal 2025 reflects capital expenditures of 10.6 million, compared to capital expenditures of 12.8 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024. Certain production capacity and efficiency improvement projects are in progress and we anticipate fiscal 2025 capital expenditures will be in the range of 25 to 30 million. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the first six months of fiscal 2025 reflects the payment of a special dividend of 304.1 million. 
 
 Financial Position 
 At October 26, 2024, working capital decreased to 196.8 million from 398.9 million at April 27, 2024. The current ratio was 2.5 to 1 at October 26, 2024 compared to 3.9 to 1 at April 27, 2024. The decrease in working capital and current ratio was due primarily to the payment of the 304.1 million cash dividend. Trade receivables decreased 3.2 million and days sales outstanding decreased to 31.1 from 31.5 days. Inventories increased 6.4 million and inventory turns declined to 8.2 times from 8.6 times. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 There have been no material changes in market risks from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024.

Table of Contents 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(e) the Borrower, the Parent, any Subsidiary, or any ERISA Affiliate shall incur or be likely to incur a liability to or on account of a Pension Plan under Sections 4062, 4063, 4064, or 4201 of ERISA or comparable provision of applicable foreign law, and there shall result from one or more of the events set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) through (v) either a liability or a material risk of incurring a liability to the PBGC, any foreign governmental entity, or a Pension Plan, which could have a material and adverse effect on the business, earnings, prospects, properties, or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower or the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 

8.12 Corporate Existence . Any act or omission (formal or informal) of the Borrower, the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary or its officers, directors, or shareholders leading to, or resulting in, the termination, invalidation (partial or total), revocation, suspension, interruption, or unenforceability of (i) its corporate existence, rights, and privileges, or (ii) its licenses, franchises, or permits where the failure to maintain, either individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to materially adversely affect the business, earnings, prospects, properties, or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 

SECTION 9. REMEDIES OF THE BANK. 

If any one or more of the Events of Default described in Section 8 shall occur, the Bank may, at its option at any time thereafter, take one or more of the following actions: (i) declare all amounts due and payable hereunder by the Borrower to the Bank and all other obligations and indebtedness owed by the Borrower to the Bank to be forthwith due and payable (with the exception of an Event of Default described in Sections 8.7 or 8.8, in which case the amounts due and payable hereunder by the Borrower to the Bank and all other obligations and indebtedness owed by the Borrower to the Bank shall automatically become due and payable), whereupon the indebtedness owed to the Bank by the Borrower hereunder and all other obligations owed by the Borrower to the Bank with accrued interest thereon, whether contingent or direct, shall forthwith become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest, or other notice of any kind from the Bank, all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything contained in the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, and all commitments to make Advances shall terminate; (ii) require the Borrower to grant a lien or a security interest in all assets of the Borrower to the Bank, subject to the provisions of Section 3.1 (b) hereof, and (iii) immediately proceed to do all other things provided for by law or the Loan Documents to enforce its rights hereunder and to collect all amounts owing to the Bank by the Borrower. No right, power, or remedy conferred upon the Bank by the Loan Documents shall be exclusive of any other right, power, or remedy referred to therein or now or hereafter available at law or in equity. 

40

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Borrower shall immediately upon demand by Bank deposit with Bank cash collateral in the amount equal to the maximum amount available to be drawn at any time under any Letter of Credit then outstanding. 

SECTION 10. CHANGES IN LAW OR CIRCUMSTANCES; INCREASED COSTS; PRICING GRID. 

10.1 Reimbursement of Prepayment Costs . If Borrower makes any payment of principal with respect to any SOFR-based Advance (or converts or refunds, or attempts to convert or refund any such Advance) on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (whether voluntarily, by acceleration, or otherwise), or if Borrower fails to borrow, refund or convert any SOFR-based Advance after notice has been given by Borrower to Bank in accordance with the terms hereof requesting such Advance, or if Borrower fails to make any payment of principal or interest in respect of a SOFR-based Advance when due, Borrower shall reimburse Bank on demand for any resulting loss, cost or expense incurred by Bank as a result thereof, including, without limitation, any such loss, cost or expense incurred in obtaining, liquidating, employing or redeploying deposits from third parties, whether or not Bank shall have funded or committed to fund such Advance. Such amount payable by Borrower to Bank may include, without limitation, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, refunded or converted, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, refund or convert, through the last day of the relevant Interest Period, at the applicable rate of interest for said Advance(s) provided under this Agreement, over (b) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by Bank) which would have accrued to Bank on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank market. Calculation of any amounts payable to Bank under this paragraph shall be made as though such Bank shall have actually funded or committed to fund the relevant Advance through the purchase of an underlying deposit in an amount equal to the amount of such Advance and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period; provided , however , that Bank may fund any SOFR-based Advance in any manner it deems fit and the foregoing assumptions shall be utilized only for the purpose of the calculation of amounts payable under this paragraph. Upon the written request of Borrower, Bank shall deliver to Borrower a certificate setting forth the basis for determining such losses, costs and expenses, which certificate shall be conclusively presumed correct, absent manifest error. 

10.2 Unavailability of Applicable Interest Rate Generally . If, at any time, Bank s obligation to maintain any of the Indebtedness hereunder at an Applicable Interest Rate based on the SOFR-based Rate is suspended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, then (a) the Prime Rate at such time will replace such interest rate for all purposes hereunder, (b) the Applicable Interest Rate hereunder in respect of such Indebtedness will be the Applicable Interest Rate based upon the Prime Referenced Rate, and (c) Bank shall have the right to make Rate Conforming Changes as provided in Section 2.8 , in each case, without any further action or consent of Borrower. 

41

10.3 Bank Unable to Determine the Applicable Interest Rate . If, at any time, Bank determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes) that (a) Bank is unable to determine or ascertain the SOFR-based Rate, or (b) the SOFR-based Rate will not adequately and fairly cover or reflect the cost to Bank of maintaining any of the Indebtedness (including, without limitation, as a result of the alteration of the methods of calculation or availability of the SOFR based Rate), Bank shall promptly give notice thereof to Borrower. Thereafter, until Bank notifies Borrower that the foregoing conditions or circumstances no longer exist, the right of Borrower to request an Advance hereunder and any obligation of Bank to maintain any of the Indebtedness hereunder at an Applicable Interest Rate based on such interest rate shall be suspended, and the Prime Referenced Rate will replace such interest rate in accordance with Section 10.2. 

10.4 Laws Affecting SOFR-based Advance Availability . If any Change in Law shall make it unlawful or impossible for Bank to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any Advance with interest at the SOFR-based Rate, Bank shall so notify Borrower and the right of Borrower to convert an Advance or refund an Advance as a SOFR-based Advance, shall be suspended and thereafter Borrower may select as Applicable Interest Rates only those which remain available and which are permitted to be selected hereunder, and if Bank may not lawfully continue to maintain an Advance to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto as a SOFR-based Advance, Borrower shall immediately prepay such Advance, together with interest to the date of payment, and any amounts payable under Section 10.1 with respect to such prepayment and the applicable Advance shall immediately be converted to a Prime-based Advance and the Prime-based Rate shall be applicable thereto. 

10.5 Increased Cost of Advances . If any Change in Law: 

(a) shall subject Bank to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to any Advance or any Revolving Credit Note or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to Bank of the principal of or interest on any Advance or the Revolving Credit Note or any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect thereof (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income or revenues of Bank imposed by the United States of America or the jurisdiction in which such Bank s principal executive office is located); or 

(b) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by Bank or shall impose on Bank or the interbank markets any other condition affecting any Advance or the Revolving Credit Note; 

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the costs to Bank of making, funding or maintaining any part of the Indebtedness hereunder as SOFR-based Advance or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the Bank under this Agreement or under the Revolving Credit Note in respect of a SOFR-based Advance then Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower in writing of such fact and demand compensation therefor and, within fifteen (15) days after such notice, Borrower agrees to pay to Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Bank for such increased cost or reduction. A certificate of Bank setting forth the basis for determining such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate Bank shall be conclusively presumed to be correct save for manifest error. 

42

10.6 Other Increased Costs . In the event that any Change in Law affects or would affect the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by Bank (or any corporation controlling Bank) and Bank determines that the amount of such capital or liquidity is increased by or based upon the existence of Bank s obligations or Advances hereunder and such increase has the effect of reducing the rate of return on Bank s (or such controlling corporation s) capital as a consequence of such obligations or Advances hereunder to a level below that which Bank (or such controlling corporation) could have achieved but for such circumstances (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity) by an amount deemed by Bank to be material, then the Borrower shall pay to Bank, from time to time, upon request by such Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank (or such controlling corporation) for any increase in the amount of capital and/or liquidity and reduced rate of return which Bank reasonably determines to be allocable to the existence of Bank s obligations or Advances hereunder. A statement as to the amount of such compensation, prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail by Bank, shall be submitted by Bank to the Borrower, reasonably promptly after becoming aware of any event described in this Section 10.6 and shall be conclusive, absent manifest error in computation. 

10.7 Margin Adjustment . Adjustments to the Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage and the Applicable Letter of Credit Percentage, based on Schedule 10.7, shall be implemented on a quarterly basis as follows: 

(a) Such adjustments shall be given prospective effect only, effective as to all Advances outstanding hereunder, the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage and the Applicable Letter of Credit Percentage, upon the date of delivery of the financial statements under Sections 6.1(a) and 6.1(b) hereunder and the Certificate of Compliance under Section 6.1(e) hereof, in each case establishing applicability of the appropriate adjustment and in each case with no retroactivity or claw-back. If Borrower shall fail timely to deliver such financial statements or the Certificate of Compliance and such failure continues for three (3) days, then (but without affecting the Event of Default resulting therefrom) from the date delivery of such financial statements and report was required until such financial statements and report are delivered, the Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage and Applicable Letter of Credit Percentage shall be at the highest level on the pricing grid attached to this Agreement as Schedule 10.7. 

(b) From the date hereof until the required date of delivery (or, if earlier, delivery) of the financial statements under Section 6.1(a) or 6.1(b) hereof, as applicable, and the Certificate of Compliance under Section 6.1(e) hereof, for the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2024, the Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage and Applicable Fee Percentage shall be those set forth under the Level I column of the pricing matrix attached to this Agreement as Schedule 10.7. Thereafter, the Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage and Applicable Fee Percentage shall be based upon the quarterly financial statements and Certificate of Compliance, subject to recalculation as provided in Section 10.7(a) above. 

43

In the case of any such waiver, the Borrower and the Bank shall be restored to their former positions prior to such Event of Default or default and shall have the same rights as they had thereto, and any Event of Default or default so waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Event of Default or default, or impair any right consequent thereto.

11.5 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies . No omission or failure of the Bank to exercise and no delay in exercising by the Bank of any right, power, or privilege hereunder, shall impair such right, power, or privilege, shall operate as a waiver thereof or be construed to be a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. The rights and remedies provided in the Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law, and the warranties, representations, covenants, and agreements made therein shall be cumulative, except in the case of irreconcilable inconsistency, in which case the provisions of this Agreement shall control.

The Bank shall be deemed to have exercised such right of set-off and to have made a charge against such items immediately upon the occurrence of such Event of Default although made or entered on its books subsequent thereof. 

11.8 Severability and Enforceability of Provisions .

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties hereby waive any provision of law that renders any provision hereof invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect.

This Agreement shall become effective upon the receipt by the Bank of signed counterparts of this Agreement from each of the parties hereto or telecopy confirmation of the signing of counterparts of this Agreement by each of the parties hereto. 

11.13 Participations .

The Bank will use its best efforts to advise the Borrower of the names of any participants and the extent of their interest herein. 

11.14 Law of Florida . This Agreement and the Revolving Credit Note have been delivered at Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, except to the extent that the Uniform Commercial Code, other personal property law or real property law of a jurisdiction where collateral that secures the loan or loans described herein is located is applicable and except as and to the extent expressed to the contrary in any of the Loan Documents.

11.15 Consent to Jurisdiction .

11.18 Legal or Governmental Limitations . Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Bank shall not be obligated to extend credit or make loans to the Borrower in an amount in violation of any limitations or prohibitions provided by any applicable statute or regulation. 

11.19 Interest . If the obligation of Borrower to pay interest on the principal balance of the Revolving Credit Notes is or becomes in excess of the maximum interest rate which Borrower is permitted by law to contract or agree to pay, giving due consideration to the execution date of this Agreement, then, in that event, the rate of interest applicable with respect to such Bank s Applicable Facility Fee Percentage shall be deemed to be immediately reduced to such maximum rate and all previous payments in excess of the maximum rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and not of interest. 

11.20 Independence of Covenants . Each covenant hereunder shall be given independent effect (subject to any exceptions stated in such covenant) so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any such covenant (taking into account any such stated exception), the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default.
