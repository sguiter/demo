 consolidated real estate properties, located in states. The properties in which the Company has an interest are primarily net leased to tenants in various industries. 
 The Company believes it has qualified as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). Accordingly, the Company will not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its shareholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income as defined under the Code. The Company is permitted to participate in certain activities from which it was previously precluded in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries TRS under the Code. As such, the TRS are subject to federal income taxes on the income from these activities. 
 The Company conducts its operations indirectly through (1) property owner subsidiaries, which are single purpose entities, (2) a wholly-owned TRS, Lexington Realty Advisors, Inc., and (3) joint ventures. Property owner subsidiaries are landlords under leases for properties in which the Company has an interest and/or borrowers under loan agreements secured by properties in which the Company has an interest and lender subsidiaries are lenders under loan agreements where the Company made an investment in a loan asset, but in all cases are separate and distinct legal entities. Each property owner subsidiary is a separate legal entity that maintains separate books and records. The assets and credit of each property owner subsidiary with a property subject to a mortgage loan are not available to creditors to satisfy the debt and other obligations of any other person, including any other property owner subsidiary or any other affiliate. Consolidated entities that are not property owner subsidiaries do not directly own any of the assets of a property owner subsidiary (or the general partner, member or managing member of such property owner subsidiary), but merely hold partnership, membership or beneficial interests therein, which interests are subordinate to the claims of such property owner subsidiary's (or its general partner's, member's or managing member's) creditors.

Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.

As significant inputs to the models are unobservable, the Company determined that the value determined for these properties falls within Level 3 of the fair value reporting hierarchy. 
 
 The majority of the inputs used to value the Company's interest rate swaps fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, such as observable market interest rate curves; however, the credit valuation associated with the interest rate swaps utilizes Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company determined that the credit valuation adjustment relative to the overall interest rate swaps was not significant. As a result, all interest rate swaps have been classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

 Sales-Type Leases. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had lease that qualified as a sales-type lease. 
 The Company has ground lease for an industrial development land parcel located in the Phoenix, Arizona market that is classified as a sales-type lease. At the commencement date of the lease, the Company evaluated the lease classification and classified the lease as a sales-type lease. The lease contains a purchase option in the amount of per land square foot starting on the second anniversary date of the lease (November 2024) and ending on the third anniversary date (November 2025). The Company determined that the purchase option was not reasonably certain of being exercised. The lease met the sales-type lease criteria because the present value of the lease payments was equal to substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset on the lease commencement date.

 The minimum lease payments above do not include reimbursements to be received from tenants for certain operating expenses and real estate taxes and do not include early termination payments provided for in certain leases, unless such payments are reasonably certain to be received. 
 Certain leases allow for the tenant to terminate the lease if the property is deemed obsolete, as defined, and upon payment of a termination fee to the landlord, as stipulated in the lease. In addition, certain leases provide the tenant with the right to purchase the leased property at fair market value or a stipulated price.

 years. Renewal periods are included in the lease term only when renewal is deemed to be reasonably certain. The lease term also includes periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option. The Company measures its lease payments by including fixed rental payments and variable rental payments that tie to an index or a rate, such as CPI. The Company recognizes lease expense for its operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease expense not included in the lease payment measurement as incurred. 
 The accounting guidance under ASC 842 requires the Company to make certain assumptions and judgments in applying the guidance, including determining whether an arrangement includes a lease, determining the term of a lease when the contract has renewal or termination provisions and determining the discount rate. 
 The Company determines whether an arrangement is or includes a lease at contract inception by evaluating whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from and can direct the use of, the identified asset for a period of time, the Company accounts for the contract as a lease. 
 The Company uses the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the discount rate for any new leases. The Company used a portfolio approach to determine its incremental borrowing rate. Lease contracts were grouped based on similar lease terms and economic environments in a manner in which the Company reasonably expects that the outcome from applying a portfolio approach does not differ materially from an individual lease approach. The Company estimated a collateralized discount rate for each portfolio of leases.

Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had equity ownership interests in approximately 118 consolidated properties, located in 17 states and containing an aggregate of approximately 58.2 million square feet of space, approximately 93.2 of which was leased. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we disposed of our remaining office properties and our portfolio is 100 industrial. 
 Our portfolio is primarily Class A real estate investments focused in our target markets within the Sunbelt and Midwest. We expect to grow in these markets by executing on our development pipeline and opportunistically acquiring facilities in these markets. However, increased financing costs continue to negatively impact transaction activity and development starts in our target markets and the markets where we own properties. Due to this, the current key drivers to growth in our revenue are leasing our vacant development properties and mark-to-market of our lease rollover. 
 Third Quarter 2024 Transaction Summary . 
 The following summarizes our transactions during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Leasing Activity: 
 Entered into a second generation new lease and lease extensions encompassing 0.5 million square feet. The average fixed rent on the second generation new lease and extended leases was 7.31 per square foot compared to the average fixed rent on these leases before extension of 5.29 per square foot. The weighted-average cost of tenant improvements and lease commissions was 3.25 per square foot for the second generation new lease and extended leases. 
 Investments: 
 Leased and placed into service a 250,020 square foot speculative development facility located in Columbus, Ohio. 
 Placed into service the remaining portion of a vacant facility containing approximately 81,000 square feet one year after the completion of base building construction. 
 Invested an aggregate of 27.5 million in development activities and 7.6 million in a value-add opportunity at the Orlando, Florida asset. 
 Debt: 
 Entered into forward interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the interest rate related to an aggregate of 250.0 million of the term loan at an average interest rate of 4.31 from January 31, 2025 to January 31, 2027. 
 Entered into forward interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the interest rate related to an aggregate of 82.5 million of the Trust Preferred Securities at an average interest rate of 5.20 from October 30, 2024 to October 30, 2027.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our critical accounting estimates are included in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to these estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flows . We believe that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with applicable REIT requirements in both the short-term and long-term. However, our cash flow from operations may be negatively affected in the near term if we experience tenant defaults. In addition, we anticipate that cash on hand, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, capital recycling proceeds, issuances of equity, mortgage proceeds and other debt, as well as other available alternatives, will provide the necessary capital required by our business. 
 At September 30, 2024, our secured debt was 56.9 million compared to 60.9 million at December 31, 2023. Our property owner subsidiaries do not have mortgage maturities with balloon payments due until 2031. With respect to mortgages encumbering properties where the expected lease rental revenues are sufficient to provide an estimated property value in excess of the mortgage balance, we believe our property owner subsidiaries have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet these obligations through future cash flows from operations, the credit markets and, if determined appropriate by us, a capital contribution from us from either cash on hand 55.0 million at September 30, 2024), property sale proceeds and borrowing capacity on our unsecured credit facility 600.0 million at September 30, 2024, subject to covenant compliance). 
 Cash flows from operations were 142.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 153.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily related to an increase in interest expense, a decrease in distributions from non-consolidated entities and the payment of a lease concession to a tenant. The underlying drivers that impact our working capital, and therefore cash flows from operations, are the timing of collection of rents, including reimbursements from tenants, payment of interest on debt and payment of operating and general and administrative costs. We believe the net-lease structure of the leases encumbering a majority of the properties in which we have an interest mitigates the risks of the timing of cash flows from operations since the payment and timing of operating costs related to the properties are generally borne directly by the tenant. The collection and timing of tenant rents are closely monitored by management as part of our cash management program. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) in investing activities totaled 64.4 million and (46.5) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities in 2024 related primarily to redeeming investments in held-to-maturity securities, proceeds from property sales and distributions received from non-consolidated entities, changes in real estate deposits, net, offset by acquisitions of real estate, investments in real estate under construction, capital expenditures, lease costs, and investments in non-consolidated entities. Cash used in investing activities in 2023 primarily related to investments in real estate under construction and capital expenditures, offset by net proceeds received from the disposition of real estate and distributions from non-consolidated entities.

Table of Contents 

Net cash used in financing activities totaled 350.6 million and 125.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash used in financing activities in 2024 was primarily related to the repayment of the 4.40 Senior Notes due 2024, dividends, debt service payments and the purchase of noncontrolling interests, offset by contributions from noncontrolling interests. 
 At-The-Market Offering Program . We maintain an At-The-Market offering program ("ATM program") under which we can issue common shares, including through forward sales contracts. 
 
 We may sell up to 350.0 million common shares over the term of the program. We did not sell shares under the ATM program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Volatility in the capital markets, including as a result of general economic conditions, may negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets through our ATM program and other offerings. 
 Share Repurchase Program. In August 2022, our Board of Trustees authorized the repurchase of an additional 10.0 million common shares under our share repurchase program with no expiration date. We did not repurchase any common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. At September 30, 2024, 6.9 million common shares remained available for repurchase under this authorization. 
 
 Dividends. Dividends paid to our common and preferred shareholders were 118.6 million and 114.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We declared a quarterly dividend of 0.13 per common share during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is an increase of 0.005 per common share from the 0.125 per common share quarterly dividend declared during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financings. The following senior notes were outstanding as of September 30, 2024: 
 Issue Date Face Amount (millions) Interest Rate Maturity Date Issue Price November 2023 300.0 6.750 November 2028 99.423 August 2020 400.0 2.700 September 2030 99.233 August 2021 400.0 2.375 October 2031 99.758 Senior notes payable 1,100.0 
 The senior notes are unsecured and requires interest payments semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the senior notes at our option at any time prior to maturity in whole or in part by paying the principal amount of the senior notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium. 
 A summary of the maturity dates and interest rates of our unsecured credit agreement, as of September 30, 2024, are as follows: 
 Maturity Date Current Interest Rate 600.0 Million Revolving Credit Facility (1) 
 July 2026 SOFR + 0.85 300.0 Million Term Loan (2) 
 January 2027 Term SOFR + 1.00 
 (1) Maturity date of the revolving credit facility can be extended to July 2027 at our option, subject to certain conditions. The interest rate includes a 0.10 adjustment. The interest rate spread ranges from SOFR plus 0.725 to 1.400 , and the revolving credit facility allows for further reductions upon the achievement of to-be-determined sustainability metrics. At September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding and availability of 600,000, subject to covenant compliance. 
 (2) The Term SOFR portion of the interest rate was swapped to obtain a current fixed-rate of 2.722 per annum, until January 31, 2025 and an aggregate amount of 250.0 million of the term loan is swapped to obtain an effective interest rate of 4.31 from January 31, 2025 to January 31, 2027. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were compliant with all applicable financial covenants contained in our corporate-level debt agreements.

Table of Contents 

During 2007, we issued 200.0 million in Trust Preferred Securities, which bore interest at a fixed-rate of 6.804 through April 2017 and, thereafter, bears interest at a variable rate of three-month SOFR plus a 26 basis point adjustment plus 170 basis points. The interest rate on an aggregate amount of 82.5 million of the Trust Preferred Securities is swapped to obtain an effective interest rate of 5.20 from October 30, 2024 to October 30, 2027. These securities are (1) classified as liabilities, (2) due in 2037 and (3) currently redeemable by us. As of September 30, 2024, and 2023, there were 129.1 million of these securities outstanding. 

Development Costs 
 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate estimated total costs of our consolidated development projects included in investment in real estate under construction are 67.0 million. We expect to incur approximately 47.5 million of additional costs, excluding noncontrolling interests' share and potential developer incentive fees or partner buyouts, to fund all of the remaining costs for our consolidated development project commitments. However, the risks associated with development, including supply chain issues, could adversely impact our estimates. As of September 30, 2024, we had three consolidated and two non-consolidated subsidiaries that owned land parcels held for industrial development. We are unable to estimate the timing of any required fundings for potential development projects on these parcels. 

Results of Operations 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with three months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in net income attributable to common shareholders of 6.4 million was primarily due to the items discussed below. 
 The increase in rental revenue of 0.7 million was primarily due to an aggregate increase in rental revenue of 5.5 million primarily due to properties placed in service and leasing, partially offset by a decrease in rental revenue of 4.8 million due to property sales. 
 The decrease in other revenue of 0.6 million was primarily due to consent income recognized in 2023 and a decrease in parking income due to the sale of the Philadelphia, PA office property in 2023. 
 The increase in depreciation and amortization expense of 2.8 million was primarily due to properties completed and placed in service in 2023 and 2024. 
 The increase in general and administrative expense of 2.4 million was primarily due to severance expense incurred after the completion of our portfolio transformation during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The increase in interest and amortization expense of 5.1 million was primarily due to a 5.3 million increase related to the 2028 Senior Notes that were issued in November 2023. Capitalized interest decreased 2.4 million primarily due to less development activity in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. These amounts were partially offset by a 2.2 million decrease in interest expense related to the 2024 Senior Notes that were paid off in June 2024 at maturity. 
 The increase in gains on sales of properties of 3.9 million was related to the timing of property dispositions. 
 The decrease in equity in earnings (losses) of non-consolidated entities of 1.2 million was primarily related to recognizing our share of gains on sale of one property from the NNN JV in 2023 in the amount of 1.0 million. 
 The increase in net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of 1.0 million is primarily related to the recognition of the noncontrolling interests' share of operating losses related to development projects placed into service vacant during 2023 and 2024. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in net income attributable to common shareholders of 4.3 million was primarily due to the items discussed below. 
 The increase in rental revenue of 2.2 million was primarily due to an aggregate increase of 18.1 million in rental revenue primarily due to properties placed in service and leasing, partially offset by a decrease of 16.0 million in rental revenue due to property sales. 
 The decrease in other revenue of 2.1 million was primarily due to a decrease in parking income due to the sale of the Philadelphia, PA office property in 2023.

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense of 6.9 million was primarily due to properties completed and placed in service in 2023 and 2024. 
 The increase in general and administrative expense of 2.9 million was primarily due to severance expense incurred after the completion of our portfolio transformation during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The increase in non-operating income of 6.4 million was primarily due to an increase in interest income earned from investing in short-term investments. 
 The increase in interest and amortization expense of 18.1 million was primarily due to a 15.9 million increase related to the 2028 Senior Notes that were issued in November 2023. Additionally, capitalized interest decreased 5.2 million primarily due to less development activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These amounts were offset by a 2.6 million decrease in interest expense related to the 2024 Senior Notes that were paid off in June 2024 at maturity. 
 The decrease in impairment charges of 16.5 million was primarily related to impairment charges recognized on office properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There were no impairment charges recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The increase in gains on sales of properties of 4.4 million was related to the timing of property dispositions. 
 The decrease in equity in earnings (losses) of non-consolidated entities of 6.0 million was primarily due to recognizing our share of a gain on sale of property related to BSH Lessee L.P. in 2023 that resulted in an increase in equity in earnings of 4.8 million. 
 The increase in net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of 2.3 million is primarily related to the recognition of the noncontrolling interests' share of operating losses related to development projects placed into service vacant during 2023 and 2024. 
 
 Same-Store Results 
 Same-store net operating income, or NOI, which is a non-GAAP measure, represents the NOI for consolidated properties that were owned, stabilized and included in our portfolio for the entirety of the two comparable reporting periods. We define NOI as operating revenues (rental income (less GAAP rent adjustments, non-cash income related to sales-type leases and lease termination income, net), and other property income) less property operating expenses. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating same-store NOI, and accordingly same-store NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. Management believes that same-store NOI is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because same-store NOI excludes the change in NOI from acquired, expanded and disposed of properties and it highlights operating trends such as occupancy levels, rental rates and operating costs on properties. However, same-store NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it does not reflect the operations of our entire portfolio, nor does it reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, acquisition-related expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, other nonproperty income and losses, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, or trends in development and construction activities which are significant economic costs and activities that could materially impact our results from operations. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to same-store NOI. 
 The following presents our consolidated same-store NOI, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 000's): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total cash base rent 64,744 61,429 190,138 181,154 Tenant reimbursements 13,224 13,019 39,839 39,101 Property operating expenses (13,550) (13,355) (41,400) (40,627) Same-store NOI 64,418 61,093 188,577 179,628

Table of Contents 

Our same-store NOI increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 by 5.4 and 5.0 , respectively, primarily due to an increase in cash base rents. As of each September 30, 2024 and 2023, our historical same-store square footage leased was 99.2 .

Funds From Operations 
 We believe that Funds from Operations, or FFO, which is a non-GAAP measure, is a widely recognized and appropriate measure of the performance of an equity REIT. We believe FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. As a result, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities, interest costs and other matters without the inclusion of depreciation and amortization, providing a perspective that may not necessarily be apparent from net income. 
 The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sales of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. The reconciling items include amounts to adjust earnings from consolidated partially-owned entities and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates to FFO. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. 
 
 We present FFO available to common shareholders and unitholders - basic and also present FFO available to all equityholders and unitholders - diluted on a company-wide basis as if all securities that are convertible, at the holder's option, into our common shares, are converted at the beginning of the period. We also present Adjusted Company FFO available to all equityholders and unitholders - diluted, which adjusts FFO available to all equityholders and unitholders - diluted for certain items which we believe are not indicative of the operating results of our real estate portfolio and not comparable from period to period. We believe this is an appropriate presentation as it is frequently requested by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties. Since others do not calculate these measures in a similar fashion, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by others. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. 
 
 Adjusted Company FFO, NOI and the other non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss as determined in accordance with GAAP. FFO, Adjusted Company FFO and NOI, and GAAP net income (loss) differ because FFO, Adjusted Company FFO and NOI exclude many items that are factored into GAAP net income or loss. 
 
 Because of the differences between FFO, Adjusted Company FFO, NOI and GAAP net income or loss, FFO, Adjusted Company FFO and NOI may not be accurate indicators of our operating performance, especially during periods in which we are acquiring and selling properties. In addition, FFO, Adjusted Company FFO and NOI are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and investors should not consider FFO, Adjusted Company FFO or NOI as alternatives to cash flows from operations, as an indication of our liquidity or as indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. 
 
 Neither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO, Adjusted Company FFO and NOI. Also, because not all companies calculate FFO, Adjusted Company FFO and NOI the same way, comparisons with other companies measures with similar titles may not be meaningful.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had investments in various real estate entities with varying structures. The real estate investments owned by our institutional joint ventures are generally financed with non-recourse debt. Non-recourse debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders' sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the assets collateralized by the debt. The lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the members or partners of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents. These exceptions generally relate to bad boy acts, including fraud, prohibited transfers and breaches of material representations, and environmental matters. We have guaranteed such obligations for certain of our non-consolidated entities with respect to 450.5 million of such non-recourse debt. We believe the likelihood of making any payments under such guaranties is remote and we generally have an agreement from each partner to reimburse us for its proportionate share of any liability related to a guarantee trigger unless such trigger is caused solely by us.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE 
 DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our exposure to market risk relates primarily to our variable-rate indebtedness not subject to interest rate swaps and our fixed-rate debt. Our consolidated aggregate principal variable-rate indebtedness not subject to interest rate swaps was 129.1 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, which represented 8.1 and 8.7 , respectively, of our aggregate principal consolidated indebtedness. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our variable-rate indebtedness had a weighted-average interest rate of 7.2 and 7.0 , respectively, and had the weighted-average interest rate been 100 basis points higher, our interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 would have increased by 0.3 million and 0.4 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our variable-rate indebtedness had a weighted-average interest rate of 7.3 and 6.7 , respectively. Had the weighted-average interest rate been 100 basis points higher, our interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 would have increased 1.0 million and 1.4 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our aggregate principal consolidated fixed-rate debt was 1.5 billion and 1.4 billion, respectively, which represented 91.9 and 91.3 , respectively, of our aggregate principal indebtedness. 
 
 For certain of our financial instruments, fair values are not readily available since there are no active trading markets as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties. Accordingly, we derive or estimate fair values using various valuation techniques, such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. However, the determination of estimated cash flows may be subjective and imprecise. Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values, especially given the volatility of the current economic environment. The following fair value was determined using the interest rates that we believe our outstanding fixed-rate indebtedness would warrant as of September 30, 2024. We believe the fair value is indicative of the interest rate environment as of September 30, 2024, but this amount does not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate fluctuations. Accordingly, we estimate that the fair value of our fixed-rate indebtedness was 1.4 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates through the use of fixed-rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements. We may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or caps to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable-rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had interest rate swap agreements (see Note 8 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report). 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report to determine if such controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, including each of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this Quarterly Report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls . Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
