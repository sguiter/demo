The million increase in contract assets during the first six months of fiscal 2025 primarily resulted from increases in contract assets for revenue recognized over time and in capitalized costs related to the Company s fulfillment of its performance obligations. Contract liabilities, included within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, consist of payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations under customer contracts, including contracts for data center cooling products and customer-owned tooling.

 percent and percent, respectively. The Company s effective tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was percent and percent, respectively. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2025 are higher than the prior year, primarily due to changes in the mix and amount of foreign and U.S. earnings. In addition, the effective tax rates for the prior-year periods were favorably impacted by the release of a million unrecognized tax benefit during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, due to a lapse in statute of limitations. The Company records valuation allowances against its net deferred tax assets to the extent it determines it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in the future. Each quarter, the Company evaluates the probability that its deferred tax assets will be realized and determines whether valuation allowances or adjustments thereto are needed. This determination involves judgement and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including expectations of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. In addition, the Company considers the duration of statutory carryforward periods and historical financial results. At September 30, 2024, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the U.S. and in certain foreign jurisdictions totaled million and million, respectively. The Company will maintain the valuation allowances in each applicable tax jurisdiction until it determines it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized, thereby eliminating the need for a valuation allowance. Future events or circumstances, such as lower taxable income or unfavorable changes in the financial outlook of the Company s operations in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, could necessitate the establishment of further valuation allowances. Accounting policies for interim reporting require the Company to adjust its effective tax rate each quarter to be consistent with its estimated annual effective tax rate. Under this methodology, the Company applies its estimated annual income tax rate to its year-to-date ordinary earnings to derive its income tax provision each quarter. The Company records the tax impacts of certain significant, unusual or infrequently occurring items in the period in which they occur. In addition, the Company excludes the impact of operations anticipated to generate net operating losses for the full fiscal year from the overall effective tax rate calculation and instead records them discretely based upon year-to-date results. The Company does not anticipate a significant change in unrecognized tax benefits during the remainder of fiscal 2025.

As additional information becomes available regarding environmental matters, the Company will re-assess the liabilities and revise the estimated accruals, if necessary. While it is possible that the ultimate environmental remediation costs may be in excess of amounts accrued, the Company believes, based upon currently available information, that the ultimate outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable outcomes could occur, including significant monetary damages. Other litigation In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are named as defendants in various lawsuits and enforcement proceedings by private parties, governmental agencies and/or others in which claims are asserted against Modine. The Company believes that any additional loss in excess of amounts already accrued would not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated balance sheet, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, management expects that the liabilities which may ultimately result from such lawsuits or proceedings, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position.

We have reported the financial results of these businesses within the Climate Solutions segment since the acquisition dates. In October 2023, we sold three automotive businesses based in Germany. The sale of these businesses, which produce air- and liquid-cooled products for internal combustion, diesel and gasoline engines for the European automotive market, supports our strategic prioritization of resources towards higher-margin technologies. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Second quarter highlights Net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 37.5 million, or 6 percent, from the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher sales in our Climate Solutions segment, partially offset by lower sales in our Performance Technologies segment. The higher Climate Solutions segment sales included 53.4 million of incremental sales from the acquired Scott Springfield Manufacturing business. The lower Performance Technologies segment sales included a 21.9 million impact of the disposition of three automotive businesses in Germany during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Cost of sales increased 7.0 million, or 1 percent. Gross profit increased 30.5 million and gross margin improved 340 basis points to 25.2 percent. Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses increased 16.9 million and included higher compensation-related expenses and incremental expenses from Scott Springfield Manufacturing, including amortization expense for acquired intangible assets. Operating income of 75.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 9.6 million from the prior year, primarily due to higher earnings in our operating segments, partially offset by higher SG A and restructuring expenses. Year-to-date highlights Net sales in the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased 76.6 million, or 6 percent, from the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales in our Climate Solutions segment, partially offset by lower sales in our Performance Technologies segment. The higher Climate Solutions segment sales included 94.5 million of incremental sales from the acquired Scott Springfield Manufacturing and Napps businesses. The lower Performance Technologies segment sales were largely driven by the 46.2 million impact of the disposition of three automotive businesses in Germany during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Cost of sales increased 11.4 million, or 1 percent, from the same period last year. Gross profit increased 65.2 million and gross margin improved 370 basis points to 24.9 percent. SG A expenses increased 38.3 million and included higher compensation-related expenses and incremental expenses from Scott Springfield Manufacturing, including amortization expense for acquired intangible assets. Operating income of 149.7 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased 17.5 million from the prior year, primarily due to higher earnings in our operating segments, partially offset by higher SG A and restructuring expenses.

 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents our consolidated financial results on a comparative basis for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Three months ended September 30, Six months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in millions) s of sales s of sales s of sales s of sales Net sales 658.0 100.0 620.5 100.0 1,319.5 100.0 1,242.9 100.0 Cost of sales 492.4 74.8 485.4 78.2 991.3 75.1 979.9 78.8 Gross profit 165.6 25.2 135.1 21.8 328.2 24.9 263.0 21.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 85.8 13.0 68.9 11.1 168.6 12.8 130.3 10.5 Restructuring expenses 4.5 0.7 0.5 0.1 9.9 0.8 0.5 Operating income 75.3 11.4 65.7 10.6 149.7 11.3 132.2 10.6 Interest expense (7.4) (1.1) (6.1) (1.0) (14.9) (1.1) (12.0) (1.0) Other (expense) income net (1.5) (0.2) 0.1 (1.8) (0.1) (0.5) Earnings before income taxes 66.4 10.1 59.7 9.6 133.0 10.1 119.7 9.6 Provision for income taxes (20.0) (3.0) (12.8) (2.1) (38.8) (2.9) (27.5) (2.2) Net earnings 46.4 7.1 46.9 7.6 94.2 7.1 92.2 7.4 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Second quarter net sales of 658.0 million were 37.5 million, or 6 percent, higher than the second quarter of the prior year, primarily due to 77.2 million of higher sales in our Climate Solutions segment, driven by 53.4 million of incremental sales from the acquired Scott Springfield Manufacturing business and organic sales growth to hyperscale and colocation data center customers. The higher sales in Climate Solutions were partially offset by lower sales in our Performance Technologies segment, which decreased 39.8 million, including a 21.9 million impact from the disposition of three automotive businesses in Germany during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Second quarter cost of sales increased 7.0 million, or 1 percent, primarily due to higher labor and inflationary costs, higher sales volume, and higher raw material costs, which increased approximately 3.0 million, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased 340 basis points to 74.8 percent, primarily due to favorable sales mix, higher average selling prices, and the favorable impact of commercial pricing settlements and the recognition of sales tax credits in Brazil within the Climate Solutions and Performance Technologies segments, respectively. As a result of higher sales and lower cost of sales as a percentage of sales, second quarter gross profit increased 30.5 million and gross margin improved 340 basis points to 25.2 percent. Second quarter SG A expenses increased 16.9 million, or 25 percent. As a percentage of sales, SG A expenses increased by 190 basis points. The increase in SG A expenses includes higher compensation-related expenses, which increased approximately 13.0 million and included incremental expenses from the acquired Scott Springfield Manufacturing business and increased incentive compensation resulting from improved financial results. In addition, SG A expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 included 4.7 million of incremental amortization expense for acquired intangible assets. These increases were partially offset by lower environmental charges related to previously-owned facilities in the U.S., which decreased 1.0 million. Restructuring expenses increased 4.0 million compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher severance expenses and product line transfer costs in the Performance Technologies and Climate Solutions segments, respectively. Operating income of 75.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 9.6 million compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher SG A and restructuring expenses.

 Interest expense during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 1.3 million compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher borrowings on our revolving credit facility, which we used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Scott Springfield Manufacturing. The provision for income taxes was 20.0 million and 12.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The 7.2 million increase was primarily due to higher earnings and changes in the mix and amount of foreign and U.S. earnings in the current year, as compared with the same period in the prior year. In addition, the provision for income taxes in the prior year was favorably impacted by the release of a 1.8 million unrecognized tax benefit during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Comparison of six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Fiscal 2025 year-to-date net sales of 1,319.5 million were 76.6 million, or 6 percent, higher than the same period last year, primarily due to 147.8 million of higher sales in our Climate Solutions segment, including 94.5 million of incremental sales from the acquired Scott Springfield Manufacturing and Napps businesses, partially offset by 73.9 million of lower sales in our Performance Technologies segment, including a 46.2 million impact from the disposition of three automotive businesses in Germany during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

 SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective April 1, 2024, we moved our Coatings business, which was previously managed by and reported within the Performance Technologies segment, under the leadership of the Climate Solutions segment. Under this refined organizational structure, the Coatings business is better aligned with the Climate Solution s Heat Transfer Products business, which serves similar heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and refrigeration HVAC R markets and customers. We believe that unifying these complementary businesses is allowing us to better focus resources on targeted growth opportunities and more efficiently apply 80/20 principles to optimize profit margins and cash flow. Segment financial information for fiscal 2024 has been recast to conform to the current presentation. The following is a discussion of our segment results of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Climate Solutions Three months ended September 30, Six months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in millions) s of sales s of sales s of sales s of sales Net sales 366.4 100.0 289.2 100.0 723.7 100.0 575.9 100.0 Cost of sales 260.1 71.0 212.3 73.4 516.6 71.4 423.2 73.5 Gross profit 106.3 29.0 76.9 26.6 207.1 28.6 152.7 26.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 40.1 11.0 29.5 10.2 80.9 11.2 56.7 9.8 Restructuring expenses 1.5 0.4 0.3 0.1 1.7 0.2 0.3 0.1 Operating income 64.7 17.6 47.1 16.3 124.5 17.2 95.7 16.6 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Climate Solutions net sales increased 77.2 million, or 27 percent, from the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to the second quarter of fiscal 2025, primarily due to higher sales volume, and, to a lesser extent, higher average selling prices. The higher sales volume includes 53.4 million of incremental sales from the acquired Scott Springfield Manufacturing business. Compared with the second quarter of the prior year, sales of data center cooling and HVAC R products increased 80.1 million and 12.9 million, respectively. The increase in sales of data center products includes sales from the acquired Scott Springfield Manufacturing business and organic sales growth to hyperscale and colocation customers. Sales of heat transfer products decreased 15.8 million. The decrease in heat transfer products largely resulted from lower sales of heat transfer coils for heat pumps and other commercial and residential applications, partially offset by commercial pricing settlements with heat pump customers in Europe. Climate Solutions cost of sales increased 47.8 million, or 23 percent, from the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to the second quarter of fiscal 2025, primarily due to higher sales volume, higher raw material costs, which increased approximately 5.0 million, and, to a lesser extent, higher labor and inflationary costs. These increases were partially offset by lower warranty expense, which decreased approximately 3.0 million. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased 240 basis points to 71.0 percent, primarily due to favorable sales mix and the favorable impact of the commercial pricing settlements during the quarter. As a result of the higher sales and lower cost of sales as a percentage of sales, gross profit increased 29.4 million and gross margin improved 240 basis points to 29.0 percent. Climate Solutions SG A expenses increased 10.6 million compared with the second quarter of the prior year. As a percentage of sales, SG A expenses increased by 80 basis points. The increase in SG A expenses includes higher compensation-related expenses, which increased approximately 5.0 million and included expenses from the acquired Scott Springfield Manufacturing business, and 4.7 million of incremental amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets.

 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Performance Technologies net sales decreased 39.8 million, or 12 percent, from the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to the second quarter of fiscal 2025, primarily due to lower sales volume, including 21.9 million of lower sales from three automotive businesses in Germany that we sold during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. These decreases were partially offset by higher average selling prices and, to a lesser extent, the recognition of sales tax credits in Brazil. Compared with the second quarter of the prior year, sales of liquid-cooled and air-cooled products decreased 27.3 million and 18.1 million, respectively. Sales of advanced solutions products increased 5.7 million. Performance Technologies cost of sales decreased 42.3 million, or 15 percent, from the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to the second quarter of fiscal 2025, primarily due to lower sales volume and, to a lesser extent, improved operating efficiencies and lower raw material costs, which decreased approximately 2.0 million. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher labor and inflationary costs. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased 310 basis points to 79.8 percent, primarily due to higher average selling prices, the favorable impact of the sales tax credits recognized in Brazil, and improved operating efficiencies. As a result of the lower sales and lower cost of sales as a percentage of sales, gross profit increased 2.5 million and gross margin improved 310 basis points to 20.2 percent. Performance Technologies SG A expenses increased 0.1 million compared with the second quarter of the prior year. As a percentage of sales, SG A expenses increased by 100 basis points. The increase in SG A expenses was primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses, which increased approximately 2.0 million, partially offset by decreases across other general and administrative expenses. Restructuring expenses increased 2.8 million compared with the second quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher severance expenses in Europe. Operating income of 30.8 million decreased 0.4 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to the second quarter of fiscal 2025, primarily due to higher restructuring expenses, partially offset by higher gross profit. Comparison of six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Performance Technologies year-to-date net sales decreased 73.9 million, or 11 percent, from the same period last year, primarily due to lower sales volume, including 46.2 million of lower sales from three automotive businesses in Germany that we sold during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. These decreases were partially offset by higher average selling prices and, to a lesser extent, the recognition of sales tax credits in Brazil. Compared with the same period in the prior year, sales of liquid-cooled and air-cooled products decreased 58.0 million and 22.2 million, respectively. Sales of advanced solutions products increased 9.1 million. Performance Technologies year-to-date cost of sales decreased 88.0 million, or 15 percent, from the same period last year, primarily due to lower sales volume and, to a lesser extent, improved operating efficiencies and lower raw material costs, which decreased approximately 9.0 million. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher labor and inflationary costs. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased 430 basis points to 79.6 percent, primarily due to higher average selling prices, improved operating efficiencies, lower material costs, and the favorable impact of the sales tax credits recognized in Brazil, partially offset by higher labor and inflationary costs. As a result of the lower sales and lower cost of sales as a percentage of sales, gross profit increased 14.1 million and gross margin improved 430 basis points to 20.4 percent.

 Restructuring expenses during the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased 8.0 million compared with the same period last year, primarily due to higher severance expenses in Europe and product line transfer costs. Operating income of 62.3 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased 3.5 million from the same period last year, primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher restructuring and SG A expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities, our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 of 78.6 million, and available borrowing capacity of 190.8 million under our revolving credit facility. Given our extensive international operations, approximately 74.0 million of our cash and cash equivalents are held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Amounts held by non-U.S. subsidiaries are available for general corporate use; however, these funds may be subject to foreign withholding taxes if repatriated. We believe our sources of liquidity will provide sufficient cash flow to adequately cover our funding needs on both a short-term and long-term basis. Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 97.8 million, which represents a 13.0 million decrease compared with the same period in the prior year. This decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to unfavorable net changes in working capital, as compared with the same period in the prior year, partially offset by the favorable impact of higher earnings. The unfavorable changes in working capital include a decrease in customer deposits associated with sales contracts with long inventory lead times and higher payments for incentive compensation, as compared with the same period in the prior year. Capital expenditures Capital expenditures of 40.3 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased 14.1 million compared with the same period in the prior year. The fiscal 2025 capital expenditures include investments supporting several of our strategic growth initiatives, including increasing production capacity for data center products. Debt Our credit agreements require us to maintain compliance with various covenants, including a leverage ratio covenant and an interest expense coverage ratio covenant, which are discussed further below. Indebtedness under our credit agreements is secured by liens on substantially all domestic assets. These agreements further require compliance with various covenants that may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness; grant liens; make investments, loans, or guarantees; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; or make restricted payments, including dividends. Also, the credit agreements may require prepayments in the event of certain asset sales. The leverage ratio covenant within our primary credit agreements requires us to limit our consolidated indebtedness, less a portion of our cash balance, both as defined by the credit agreements, to no more than three and one-quarter times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other adjustments Adjusted EBITDA ). We are also subject to an interest expense coverage ratio covenant, which requires us to maintain Adjusted EBITDA of at least three times consolidated interest expense. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. We expect to remain in compliance with our debt covenants during the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond. U.S. pension plan termination In June 2024, we approved the termination of our U.S. pension plan, subject to approvals from the Internal Revenue Service and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. We intend to offer certain participants the option to receive their pension benefits in the form of a lump-sum distribution prior to purchasing annuity contracts to transfer our remaining obligations under the plan. In connection with the plan termination, we expect to make additional cash contributions in the range of 10.0 million to 25.0 million to fully fund the plan, on a plan termination basis, and to record non-cash pension settlement charges totaling approximately 120.0 million to 130.0 million during fiscal 2026. The timing and amount of the final cash contribution and settlement charges could materially differ from our estimates due to the nature and timing of participant settlements, prevailing market and economic conditions, the duration of the termination process, or other factors.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management of the Company, with the participation of the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and under the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, at a reasonable assurance level, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As described below, management previously identified a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. This material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable new and enhanced controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management can conclude, through testing, that the controls are designed and operating effectively. As remediation of the material weakness is not yet complete, the President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures continue to be ineffective as of September 30, 2024. Notwithstanding the material weakness, management performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are fairly presented in all material respects in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Previously-identified material weakness As reported in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, management identified a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting related to IT general controls in Europe for systems supporting the Company s accounting and financial reporting processes. Specifically, the Company did not appropriately restrict access to certain systems. As a result, automated process-level controls and manual controls that are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of information derived from those IT systems were also ineffective since they could have been adversely impacted. The material weakness resulted from an insufficient number of trained resources with the IT expertise necessary to appropriately assess and be accountable for IT-related risks or effectively design, implement, and operate controls to monitor and restrict access to systems that support the Company s accounting and financial reporting processes. Management s remediation activities Management is substantially complete or in the process with the following steps, which it believes will fully address the underlying causes of the material weakness: Engaging resources, including current team members, new hires, and external consultants with appropriate expertise to be held accountable for effectively assessing IT-related risks and designing, implementing and operating controls needed to mitigate those risks; and Designing and implementing controls to effectively restrict and monitor access to systems that support the Company s accounting and financial reporting processes. 
 Management believes that these actions and control improvements, when fully implemented and tested, will strengthen the Company s internal control over financial reporting and remediate the material weakness identified. Changes in internal control over financial reporting The Company acquired Scott Springfield Manufacturing during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and is currently integrating the operations, processes and internal controls of the acquired company. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information regarding the acquisition.

 Except for the remediation steps described above and the integration activities for the Scott Springfield Manufacturing acquisition, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
