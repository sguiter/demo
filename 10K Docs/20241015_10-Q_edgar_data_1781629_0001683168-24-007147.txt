Limited Operating History and Need for Additional
Capital 

There is no historical financial information about
us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have generated limited revenues. Our business
is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost
overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. 

We have no assurance that future financing will
be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or
expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. 

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not Applicable. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We carried out an evaluation as of August 31,
2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, who are one and the same, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(f)
and 15d 15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of
the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during our most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
