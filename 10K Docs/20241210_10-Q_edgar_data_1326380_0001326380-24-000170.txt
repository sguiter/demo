 OVERVIEW 
 GameStop Corp. GameStop, we, us, our, or the Company ), a Delaware corporation established in 1996, is a leading specialty retailer offering games and entertainment products through its thousands of stores and ecommerce platforms. 
 We operate our business in four geographic segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. Our fiscal year is composed of the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. Fiscal 2024 consists of 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025 ("fiscal 2024"). Fiscal 2023 consisted of 53 weeks ended on February 3, 2024. All nine month periods presented herein contain 39 weeks. All references to years, quarters and months relate to fiscal periods rather than calendar periods. The discussion and analysis of our results of operations refers to continuing operations unless otherwise noted. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of the net sales realized during the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. 
 
 BUSINESS PRIORITIES 
 GameStop is following a strategic plan to fully leverage its unique position and brand recognition in gaming through a new phase of transformation. Our strategic plan is designed to optimize our core business and achieve profitability. 
 GameStop is actively focused on the below objectives: 
 Establish Omnichannel Retail Excellence. We aim to be the leading destination for games and entertainment products through our stores and ecommerce platforms. To accomplish this, we are taking steps to ensure we are a fast and convenient solution for our customers. This includes increased product availability across all channels, faster fulfillment through ship from store offerings, and a further improved customer service experience. 
 Achieve Profitability. During fiscal 2023, we continued to optimize our cost structure to align with our current and anticipated future needs. We will continue to focus on cost containment, including closing underperforming stores, as we look to operate with increased efficiency. 
 Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth. GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong household brand recognition and a significant store network. 
 We believe these efforts are important aspects of our continued business to enable long-term value creation for our shareholders. 
 In connection with our efforts to achieve sustained profitability, we continue to evaluate our international assets and operations, to determine their strategic and financial fit and to eliminate redundancies and underperforming assets. To date we have taken the following steps as part of this ongoing effort: 
 During fiscal 2023, we exited our operations in Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria. 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we initiated a plan to wind down our operations in Germany, with store operations scheduled to end by the close of the fiscal year. 
 On November 8, 2024, we sold our Italian subsidiary, GameStop Italy S.r.l, which operated our Italian stores and e-commerce business. The stores in Italy will continue to operate under the GameStop brand for a transition period of up to six months. We recognized impairment expense of 7.6 million on the assets during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The proceeds and loss on the sale are expected to be immaterial to our financial results. 
 We have also initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors, including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance. While this review is 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate that it may result in the closure of a larger number of stores than we have closed in the past few years. 
 While we expect our cost containment efforts to yield reductions in selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses in the long term, we have incurred and may continue to incur non-recurring costs related to these efforts in the short term. 
 We also continue to explore ways to increase the size of our addressable market through new product and service offerings, including offerings in the graded collectibles category. On October 15, 2024, GameStop announced that it had entered into a collaboration with Collectors Holdings, Inc., through its Professional Sports Authenticator division ("PSA"). As part of this collaboration, GameStop became an authorized PSA dealer, and PSA provides autograph authentication and grading services for trading cards through select GameStop stores across the United States. 
 Investments 
 
 On December 5, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") approved a new investment policy (the Investment Policy ). Subsequently, on March 21, 2024, the Board unanimously authorized revisions to the Investment Policy to codify the role of certain members of the Board in overseeing the Company s investments. In accordance with the revised Investment Policy, the Board has delegated authority to manage the Company s portfolio of securities investments to an Investment Committee of the Board (the "Investment Committee") consisting of the Company s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Ryan Cohen, and two independent members of the Board, together with such personnel and advisors as the Investment Committee may choose. The Company s investments must conform to guidelines set forth in the revised Investment Policy or be approved by either the Investment Committee, by unanimous vote, or the full Board, by majority vote. Additionally, the Investment Committee may recommend to the Board further modifications to the Investment Policy from time to time. 
 
 The Investment Committee will direct the investment activity of the Company in public and private markets pursuant to authority granted by the Board. Depending on certain market conditions and various risk factors, Mr. Cohen or other members of the Investment Committee, each in their personal capacity or through affiliated investment vehicles, may at times invest in the same securities in which the Company invests. The Board anticipates that such investments will align the interests of the Company with the interests of related parties because it places the personal resources of such directors at risk in substantially the same manner as resources of the Company in connection with investment decisions made by the Investment Committee on behalf of the Company.

 During the three months ended November 2, 2024, net sales in our Canada, Europe, United States, and Australia segments decreased by 24.5 , 22.0 , 20.4 , and 12.5 , respectively, compared to the prior year. The decrease in consolidated net sales for the three months ended November 2, 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to a 162.0 million, or 28.0 , decline in the sale of hardware and accessories, a 49.5 million, or 15.4 , decline in the sale of software, and a 6.5 million, or 3.7 , decline in the sale of collectibles.

 During the nine months ended November 2, 2024, net sales in our Canada, Europe, United States, and Australia segments decreased by 33.4 , 33.1 , 25.0 , and 24.9 , respectively, compared to the prior year. The decrease in consolidated net sales for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 was primarily attributable to a 337.5 million, or 31.9 , decline in the sale of software, a 528.3 million, or 27.8 , decline in the sale of hardware and accessories, and a 73.0 million, or 14.0 , decline in the sale of collectibles. 
 Gross Profit 
 During the three months ended November 2, 2024, gross profit decreased 24.6 million, or 8.7 , compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 29.9 , compared to 26.1 in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the decrease in net sales, as further outlined in the net sales commentary. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to a shift to higher margin product categories, specifically collectibles and preowned hardware and accessories, as well as improvements in inventory management. Sales of collectibles as a percentage of total net sales increased to 19.9 for the three months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 16.5 in the prior year. Sales of preowned hardware and accessories as a percentage of total net sales increased to 11.5 for the three months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 10.2 in the prior year. 
 During the nine months ended November 2, 2024, gross profit decreased 124.5 million, or 14.2 , compared to the prior year.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 29.5 , compared to 25.1 in the prior year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to a shift to higher margin product categories, specifically collectibles and preowned hardware and accessories, as well as improvements in inventory management. Sales of collectibles as a percentage of total net sales increased to 17.7 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 15.0 in the prior year. Sales of pre-owned hardware and accessories as a percentage of total net sales increased to 12.0 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 10.0 in the prior year. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

 The decline in SG A expenses for the three months ended November 2, 2024 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to a reduction in labor-related, consulting service, and marketing costs of 24.4 million, driven by our continued focus on cost reduction efforts, partially offset by 14.3 million of deferred income recognized in the prior year in connection with our NFT marketplace. Additionally, store-related costs decreased 8.4 million in the current year in connection with prior year store closures, primarily in our European segment. 
 During the nine months ended November 2, 2024, SG A expenses decreased 116.8 million, or 12.1 , compared to the prior year. SG A expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 33.4 , compared to 27.7 in the prior year.

 reduction efforts and a 6.4 million benefit from legal settlements in the current year period, partially offset by 42.9 million of deferred income recognized in the prior year in connection with our NFT marketplace, and 10 million of accelerated depreciation expense recognized in the current year in connection with the closure of our York, Pennsylvania fulfillment facility. Additionally, store-related costs and depreciation expense decreased 14.5 million and 15.0 million, respectively, in the current year, primarily due to prior year store and facility closures. 
 Interest Income, net 
 During the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024, we recognized net interest income of 54.2 million and 108.6 million, respectively, compared to net interest income of 12.9 million and 34.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2023. The impact is primarily attributable to interest income increasing as a result of higher returns on invested cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as return on cash received from the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock from the ATM Offering. 
 Income Tax 
 We recognized income tax expense of 3.4 million for the three months ended November 2, 2024, compared to an income tax benefit of 1.2 million for the three months ended October 28, 2023. Our effective income tax rate was 16.3 for the three months ended November 2, 2024 compared to 27.9 for the three months ended October 28, 2023. 
 
 Our effective income tax rate for the three months ended November 2, 2024 is primarily due to tax expense recognized during the third quarter in connection with our sale of property in Ireland, and in connection with an Italian tax audit. 
 
 Our effective income tax rate for the three months ended October 28, 2023 is primarily due to the recognition of tax benefits on certain current period losses, partially offset by forecasted income taxes due in certain jurisdictions in which we operate.

 Board amended the new Investment Policy. See "Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments for more information. Gains and losses on marketable securities may fluctuate significantly from period to period in the future and could have a significant impact on the Company s results of operations.

On August 27, 2024, we voluntarily terminated the 2026 Revolver, including all commitments and obligations thereunder. 
 Some of our vendors have requested and may continue to request credit support collateral for our inventory purchase obligations and the levels of such collateral will depend on a variety of factors, including our inventory purchase levels, available payment terms for inventories, favorable credit terms and costs of providing collateral. 
 We maintain uncommitted facilities with certain lenders that provide for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees, at times supported by cash collateral. As of November 2, 2024, we had letters of credit and other bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of 20.2 million.
