NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

The information presented herein as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is unaudited. 

We are also exploring the use of cyclodextrins in the treatment of Alzheimer s disease. In January 2018, the FDA authorized a single patient IND expanded access program using Trappsol Cyclo for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease. Based on the data collected from this patient combined with the data from our NPC studies, we prepared a synopsis for an early-stage protocol using Trappsol Cyclo intravenously to treat Alzheimer s disease that was presented to the FDA in January of 2021. We received feedback from the FDA on this synopsis in April 2021 and incorporated the feedback into an IND for a Phase II study for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease with Trappsol Cyclo that we submitted to the FDA in November 2021. In December of 2021, we received IND clearance from the FDA, allowing us to proceed with our Phase II study of Trappsol Cyclo for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease. U.S. sites for the study were activated during the second half of 2022, with patient dosing beginning in the first quarter of 2023. 

We also continue to operate our legacy fine chemical business, consisting of the sale of cyclodextrins and related products to the pharmaceutical, nutritional, and other industries, primarily for use in diagnostics and specialty drugs. However, our core business has transitioned to a biotechnology company primarily focused on the development of cyclodextrin- based biopharmaceuticals for the treatment of disease from a business that had been primarily reselling basic cyclodextrin products. 

Proposed Acquisition by Rafael Holdings 

On August 21, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Rafael Holdings, Inc. Rafael ), a Delaware corporation; and Tandem Therapeutics, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rafael First Merger Sub and Tandem Therapeutics, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Rafael Second Merger Sub ). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Rafael, First Merger Sub and the Company will be merged with and into Rafael (the First Merger ), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rafael. Immediately following the First Merger, the Company will merge with and into the Second Merger Sub (the Second Merger , and together with the First Merger, the Merger with Rafael being the surviving entity of the Second Merger. The name of the Surviving Entity will be changed to Cyclo Therapeutics, LLC. 

At the closing of the Merger, each outstanding share of Company common stock will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Rafael Class B common stock calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement (the Exchange Ratio ). The Exchange Ratio was initially estimated to be 0.3112 shares of Rafael Class B common stock for each share of Company common stock. The actual exchange ratio will be determined at the time of closing based on valuing Company common stock at 0.95 per share and Rafael at the combined value of its cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, real estate and certain other financial holdings plus amounts loaned by Rafael to the Company between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, less certain of Rafael s current liabilities. In addition, the cash value with take into account the funding of the Company s operations by Rafael with convertible notes through closing, as discussed at Note (7). Any fractional shares of Rafael Class B common stock will be rounded up to the nearest whole share. 

All compensatory options to purchase Company common stock will be converted into an option to acquire Rafael Class B common stock, as described in the Merger Agreement. 

Unless otherwise provided for in outstanding warrant agreements, all outstanding warrants to purchase Cyclo common stock (other than those held by Rafael which will be cancelled) will automatically be converted into warrants to purchase a number of shares of Rafael Class B common stock, at an adjusted exercise price per share based upon the Exchange Ratio. Certain holders of Cyclo warrants, representing Cyclo warrant shares, have the right to elect to receive cash payment in an amount equal to the Black Sholes Value of the unexercised portion of their warrants on the date of consummation of the Merger in lieu of receiving warrants to purchase Rafael Class B common stock. 

Holders of Cyclo Public Warrants will receive Rafael Public Warrants in exchange for their Cyclo Public Warrants. 

The Merger Agreement contains specified termination rights of each of the Company and Rafael. In connection with a termination of the Merger Agreement in specified circumstances, the terminating party will be reimbursed for transaction costs of up to . If the Merger Agreement is terminated by Company due to the Company s board of directors making an adverse change recommendation, the Company will be required to pay a termination fee to Rafael. 

The boards of directors of each of the Company and Rafael have approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions, including the requisite approval by the Company's and Rafael's stockholders and the effectiveness of a registration statement to register the shares of Rafael Class B common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in late December. 

Although the Company has entered into the Merger Agreement and intends to consummate the proposed Merger, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully consummate the proposed Merger on a timely basis, or at all. 

Going Concern and Liquidity 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of and , respectively. The Company has an accumulated deficit of at September 30, 2024. Our recent losses have predominantly resulted from research and development expenses for our Trappsol Cyclo product and other general operating expenses, including personnel expenses and board advisory fees. We believe our expenses will continue to increase as we continue to conduct clinical trials and seek regulatory approval for the use of Trappsol Cyclo in the treatment of NPC and Alzheimer s disease. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s operations used in cash, and at September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash and cash equivalents balance of and negative working capital of . We will need to raise additional capital in the foreseeable future to fund the development of our drug product candidates through clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization. 

Rafael has agreed to fund the Company through the earlier of the consummation of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement in such amounts as may be necessary for the Company to operate its business and pay its debts and obligations as they become due, provided that the Company is not in active discussions regarding an acquisition proposal and is being operated in a manner consistent with the terms of the Merger Agreement and the financial forecast previously shared with Rafael. As discussed in Note 7, the Company has borrowed from Rafael through November 12, 2024. 

We intend to continue to borrow from Rafael through the consummation of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, we intend to continue to raise such capital through the sale of equity securities from time to time, the issuance of debt securities, the sale or licensing of existing assets or assets in development, or from other non-dilutive funding mechanisms. Our ability to obtain such additional capital will likely be subject to various factors, including our overall business performance and market conditions. If we cannot raise the additional funds required for our anticipated operations, we may be required to reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, delay our clinical trials and the ability to seek regulatory approvals, downsize our general and administrative infrastructure, and/or seek alternative measures to avoid insolvency. If we raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our common stock or other securities, such offerings would cause dilution of current stockholders percentage ownership in the Company, which could be substantial. Future offerings also could have a material and adverse effect on the price of our common stock. 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates that we will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the availability of equity or debt financing as noted above, including from Rafael. Various factors including our overall business performance and market conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed and consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

at September 30, 2024. 

. 

The Company develops and documents its allowance for credit losses on its trade receivables based on portfolio segments, which include domestic and international customers. The determination of portfolio segments is based primarily on the customers geographical location. Our quantitative allowance for credit loss estimates was determined using the method that uses an aging schedule. The Company also considers qualitative adjustments that may relate to unique risks, changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results, or other relevant factors to further inform our estimate of the allowance for credit losses. 

Revenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial. We treat shipping and handling costs performed after a customer obtains control of the product as a fulfillment cost. We have identified one performance obligation in our contracts with customers which is the delivery of product to our customers. The transaction price is recognized in full when we deliver the product to our customer, which is the point at which we have satisfied our performance obligation. 

For additional information on our revenues, please read Note 3, Revenues, to these condensed consolidated financial statements. 

shares of common stock were antidilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and warrants to purchase shares of common stock were antidilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock were antidilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock were antidilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and therefore also excluded. 

This expense is then trued up at the time the shares are issued to directors based on the trading price at the time of issuance. 

The Company periodically issues stock options under its 2021 Equity Incentive Plan. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation method to estimate the fair value of stock options at grant date. Compensation expense is recognized on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.

Options granted under the Incentive Plan may either be intended to qualify as incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or may be non-qualified options, and are exercisable over periods not exceeding ten years from date of grant. As of September 30, 2024, we had awarded shares of common stock as awards under the Incentive Plan, with no shares of common stock remaining available for future awards under the Incentive Plan. 

On June 24, 2021 , the Company s stockholders approved the Company s 2021 Equity Incentive Plan at its annual meeting of stockholders (the 2021 Plan ). The 2021 Plan provides for the issuance of up to shares of common stock pursuant to the grant of shares of common stock, stock options or other awards, to employees, officers or directors of, and consultants to, the Company and its subsidiaries. Options granted under the 2021 Plan may either be intended to qualify as incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 , as amended, or may be non-qualified options, and are exercisable over periods not exceeding ten years from date of grant. As of September 30, 2024 , we had awarded shares of common stock and granted options to purchase shares of common stock under the 2021 Plan, with shares of common stock remaining available for future awards. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no options to purchase common stock were granted and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted options to purchase shares of common stock under the 2021 Plan.

Overview 

We are a clinical stage biotechnology company that develops cyclodextrin-based products for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. We filed a Type II Drug Master File with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA in 2014 for our lead drug candidate, Trappsol Cyclo (hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin) as a treatment for Niemann-Pick Type C disease NPC ). NPC is a rare and fatal autosomal recessive genetic disease resulting in disrupted cholesterol metabolism that impacts the brain, lungs, liver, spleen, and other organs. In 2015, we launched an International Clinical Program for Trappsol Cyclo as a treatment for NPC. In 2016, we filed an Investigational New Drug application IND with the FDA, which described our Phase I clinical plans for a randomized, double blind, parallel group study at a single clinical site in the U.S. The Phase I study evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of Trappsol Cyclo along with markers of cholesterol metabolism and markers of NPC during a 12-week treatment period of intravenous administration of Trappsol Cyclo every two weeks to participants 18 years of age and older. The IND was approved by the FDA in September 2016, and in January 2017 the FDA granted Fast Track designation to Trappsol Cyclo for the treatment of NPC. Initial patient enrollment in the U.S. Phase I study commenced in September 2017, and in May 2020 we announced top line data showing Trappsol Cyclo was well tolerated in this study. 

We have also completed a Phase I/II clinical study approved by European regulatory bodies with clinical trial centers in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Israel. The Phase I/II study evaluated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Trappsol Cyclo through a range of clinical outcomes, including neurologic, respiratory, and measurements of cholesterol metabolism and markers of NPC. Consistent with the 12-week Phase study (single US site), the European/Israel study administered Trappsol Cyclo intravenously to NPC patients every two weeks in a double-blind, randomized trial, but differs in that the study period was for 48 weeks (24 doses). In March of 2021 we announced that 100 of patients who completed the trial (9 out of 12) improved or remained stable, and 89 met the outcome measure in at least two domains of the 17-domain NPC severity scale. We did not conduct a Phase II trial in the U.S. and instead relied on the data obtained from our Phase I/II trial abroad to support the commencement of our Phase III trial in the U.S. 

In February 2020 we had a face-to-face Type C meeting with the FDA with respect to the initiation of our pivotal Phase III clinical trial of Trappsol Cyclo based on the clinical data obtained to date. At that meeting, we also discussed with the FDA submitting a New Drug Application (NDA) under Section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the treatment of NPC in pediatric and adult patients with Trappsol Cyclo . A similar request was submitted to the European Medicines Agency EMA in February 2020, seeking scientific advice and protocol assistance from the EMA for proceeding with a Phase III clinical trial in Europe. In October 2020 we received a Study May Proceed notification from the FDA with respect to the proposed Phase III clinical trial, and in June of 2021 we commenced enrollment in TransportNPC, a pivotal Phase III study of Trappsol Cyclo for the treatment of NPC. In May 2024, we enrolled the last of the 104 patients enrolled in the Phase III study. 

- 21 -

On May 17, 2010, the FDA designated Trappsol Cyclo as an orphan drug for the treatment of NPC, which would provide us with the exclusive right to sell Trappsol Cyclo for the treatment of NPC for seven years following FDA drug approval. In April 2015, we also obtained Orphan Drug Designation for Trappsol Cyclo in Europe, which will provide us with ten years of market exclusivity following regulatory approval, which period will be extended to 12 years upon acceptance by the EMA s Pediatric Committee of our pediatric investigation plan (PIP) demonstrating that Trappsol Cyclo addresses the pediatric population. On January 12, 2017, we received Fast Track Designation from the FDA, and on December 1, 2017, the FDA designated NPC a Rare Pediatric Disease. 

We are also exploring the use of cyclodextrins in the treatment of Alzheimer s disease. In January 2018, the FDA authorized a single patient IND expanded access program using Trappsol Cyclo for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease. Based on the data collected from this patient combined with the data from our NPC studies, we prepared a synopsis for an early stage protocol using Trappsol Cyclo intravenously to treat Alzheimer s disease that was presented to the FDA in January of 2021. We received feedback from the FDA on this synopsis in April 2021 and incorporated the feedback into an IND for a Phase II study for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease with Trappsol Cyclo that we submitted to the FDA in November 2021. In December of 2021, we received IND clearance from the FDA, allowing us to proceed with our Phase II study of Trappsol Cyclo for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease. U.S. sites for the study were activated during the second half of 2022, with patient dosing beginning in the first quarter of 2023. 

We filed an international patent application in October 2019 under the Patent Cooperation Treaty directed to the treatment of Alzheimer s disease with cyclodextrins, and we are pursuing national and regional stage applications based on this international application. The terms of any patents resulting from these national or regional stage applications would be expected to expire in 2039 if all the requisite maintenance fees are paid. 

On January 2024, we received a notice of allowance of our patent application for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO regarding our Patent Application No. 17/289,137 " Methods of Treating Alzheimer s Disease . In July 2024 we received a notice of decision from the European Patent Office to grant a patent application regarding the methods to treat Alzheimer s Disease, with an effective date of August 21, 2024. 

We also continue to operate our legacy fine chemical business, consisting of the sale of cyclodextrins and related products to the pharmaceutical, nutritional, and other industries, primarily for use in diagnostics and specialty drugs. However, our core business has transitioned to a biotechnology company primarily focused on the development of cyclodextrin- based biopharmaceuticals for the treatment of disease from a business that had been primarily reselling basic cyclodextrin products. 

Proposed Acquisition by Rafael Holdings 

On August 21, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Rafael Holdings, Inc. Rafael ), a Delaware corporation; and Tandem Therapeutics, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Rafael First Merger Sub and Tandem Therapeutics, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Rafael Second Merger Sub ). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Rafael, First Merger Sub and the Company will be merged with and into Rafael (the First Merger ), with Company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rafael. Immediately following the First Merger, the Company will merge with and into the Second Merger Sub (the Second Merger , and together with the First Merger, the Merger with Rafael being the surviving entity of the Second Merger. The name of the Surviving Entity will be changed to Cyclo Therapeutics, LLC. More information regarding the proposed acquisition and the terms of the Merger Agreement are discussed in Note 1 Organization and Description of Business of the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Results of Operations Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

We reported net losses of approximately 8,832,000 and 19,157,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net losses of approximately 4,771,000 and 14,415,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Total revenues for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, decreased 53 to approximately 234,000 compared to approximately 495,000 for the same period in 2023. Total revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, decreased 27 to approximately 559,000 compared to approximately 765,000 for the same period in 2023. Our change in the mix of our product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: 

Trappsol HPB 

 Our sales of Trappsol HPB decreased by 89 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, to approximately 37,000 compared to approximately 342,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our sales of Trappsol HPB decreased by 47 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, to approximately 256,000 compared to approximately 485,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Sales of cyclodextrin are very volatile and hard to predict. The decrease was caused by a reclassification of revenue derived from compassionate sales of Trappsol Cyclo 

Other Trappsol products 

 Our sales of other Trappsol products increased by 29 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, to approximately 196,000 compared to approximately 152,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our sales of other Trappsol products increased by 12 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, to approximately 300,000, compared to approximately 267,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Aquaplex 

 Our sales of Aquaplex for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, were approximately 100, as compared to sales of Aquaplex for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of approximately 60. Our sales of Aquaplex for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, were approximately 660, as compared to sales of Aquaplex for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of approximately 10,000. 

- 23 -

The largest customers for our legacy fine chemical business continue to follow historical product ordering trends by placing periodic large orders that represent a significant share of our annual sales volume. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our four largest customers accounted for 90 of our sales; the largest accounted for 35 of sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our three largest customers accounted for 86 of our sales; the largest accounted for 42 of sales. Historically, our usual smaller sales of HPB occur more frequently throughout the year compared to our large sales that we receive periodically. The timing of when we receive and are able to complete these two kinds of sales has a significant effect on our quarterly revenues and operating results and makes period to period comparisons difficult. 

Our cost of products sold (excluding any allocation of direct and indirect overhead and handling costs) for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, decreased 56 to approximately 17,000 compared to approximately 39,000 for the same period in 2023. Our cost of products sold (excluding any allocation of direct and indirect overhead and handling costs) for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, decreased 39 to approximately 42,000 compared to approximately 69,000 for the same period in 2023. Our cost of products sold (excluding any allocation of direct and indirect overhead and handling costs) as a percentage of sales was 8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Historically, the timing and product mix of sales to our large customers has had a significant effect on our sales, cost of products sold (excluding any allocation of direct and indirect overhead and handling costs) and the related margin. We did not experience any significant increases in material costs during 2023 or the first nine months of 2024. 

Our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities, since some entities include all the costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold. Our cost of goods sold includes only the cost of products sold and does not include any allocation of inbound or outbound freight charges, indirect overhead expenses, warehouse and distribution expenses, or depreciation expense. Our employees provide receiving, inspection, warehousing and shipping operations for us. The cost of our employees is included in personnel expense. Our other costs of warehousing and shipping functions are included in office and other expense. 

As we buy inventory from foreign suppliers, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Euro, Yen and Yuan has an effect on our cost of inventory. Our main supplier of specialty cyclodextrins and complexes, Cyclodextrin Research Development Laboratory, is located in Hungary and its prices are set in Euros. The cost of our bulk inventory often changes due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar. The cost of shipping from outside the U.S. also has a significant effect on our inventory acquisition costs. When we experience short-term increases in currency fluctuation or supplier price increases, we are often not able to raise our prices sufficiently to maintain our historical margins. Therefore, our margins on these sales may decline. 

Personnel expenses increased by 1 , to approximately 843,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 835,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Personnel expenses increased by 2 , to approximately 2,581,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 2,527,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in personnel expenses is primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense. We expect to maintain our level of employees and related costs in the near term. 

Research and development expenses increased 58 to approximately 5,493,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 3,469,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Research and development expenses increased 18 to approximately 11,830,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 10,037,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Research and development expenses as a percentage of our total operating expenses decreased to 60 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 66 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase in research and development expense resulted in the spending related to the NPC program, while the decrease was related to an increase in operating expenses. 

Professional fees increased 137 to approximately 1,412,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 597,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Professional fees increased 63 to approximately 2,430,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 1,494,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Professional fees may continue to increase in the future due to Merger expenses and the continuation of product development. 

Office and other expenses increased 190 to approximately 641,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 221,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Office and other expenses increased 204 to approximately 2,361,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 776,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is attributable to lease expense for a lease assumed in December 2023. The lease expense is offset by sublease income. 

- 24 -

We increased our valuation allowance to offset the increase in our deferred tax asset from our net operating loss and did not recognize an income benefit or provision for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our cash and cash equivalents decreased to approximately 928,000 as of September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 9,247,000 as of December 31, 2023. We had negative working capital of approximately 15,463,491 as of September 30, 2024, compared to positive working capital of approximately 3,850,000 at December 31, 2023. Cash used in operations was approximately 18,223,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 11,890,000 for the same period in 2023. 

The Company has continued to realize losses from operations. As a result of our recent note financings with Rafael, we have had sufficient cash to meet our ongoing operating costs and capital expenditure requirements. Rafael has agreed to fund the Company through the earlier of the consummation of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement in such amounts as may be necessary for the Company to operate its business and pay its debts and obligations as they become due, provided that the Company is not in active discussions regarding an acquisition proposal and is being operated in a manner consistent with the terms of the Merger Agreement and the financial forecast previously shared with Rafael. As discussed in Note 7, the Company has borrowed 15,000,000 from Rafael through November 12, 2024. 

We intend to continue to borrow from Rafael through the consummation of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, we will need to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities or the entering into of alternative transactions in order to support our ongoing operations and continue our clinical trials. These activities are necessary to fund the development of our drug product candidates through clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization. Our ability to obtain such additional capital will likely be subject to various factors, including our overall business performance, market conditions and our ability to identify strategic partners. There can be no guarantee that the Company will be successful in its ability to raise capital to fund future operational and development initiatives. 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 were prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates that we will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the availability of equity or debt financing or an alternative strategy as noted above. As stated above, various factors including our overall business performance, market conditions and the ability to identify strategic partners raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

At December 31, 2023, we had approximately 49,807,000 in net state and federal operating loss carryforwards expiring from 2024 through 2037, including 41,409,000 that will not expire, that can be used to offset our current and future taxable net income and reduce our income tax liabilities. We experienced an "ownership change" within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the Internal Revenue Code during the year ended December 31, 2023. As a result of the ownership change we are limited in our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other built in deductions in computing our taxable income beginning with the ownership change date. We have not performed an analysis to determine such limitations. We have provided a 100 valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset based on our expected future expenses related to our clinical trials and other development initiatives. 

We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. 

Cash Flows 

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 18,223,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately 11,890,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the increase in activities for our clinical trials and on-going operational expenses. 

- 25 -

Investment Activities 

The Company had no net cash provided by or used in investing activities for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 9,904,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of approximately 12,149,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities is attributable to proceeds from the sale of warrants and stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, that did not occur during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company received proceeds of 10,000,000 from convertible notes payable to Rafael. 

Critical Estimates 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We continually evaluate our judgments, estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on the terms of underlying agreements, our expected course of development, historical experience and other factors we believe are reasonable based on the circumstances, the results of which form our management s basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. For information about critical accounting policies, see the discussion of critical accounting policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not applicable. 

- 26 -

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

a. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the "Evaluation Date"). Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have concluded that, at the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

b. Material Weakness over Complex Equity Instruments 

During the preparation of our interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls relating to the accounting of complex equity instruments. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, the controls related to the evaluation of the appropriate accounting classification of warrants as equity classified. 

Remediation Plan 

Management, with the oversight from our Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, updated our internal controls to remediate the material weakness by supplementing our internal procedures through the contracted review of equity transactions by technical accounting experts. 

We will not be able to conclude whether the actions we are taking will fully remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting until the updated controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that such controls are operating effectively. We may also conclude that additional measures may be required to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which may necessitate further action. 

c. Changes in Internal Control. 

Other than the remediation plan discussed above, we made no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal controls that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or which is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. We are now taking actions to remediate the material weakness, which may result in changes in our internal control over financial reporting in subsequent periods.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we are a party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Our management evaluates our exposure to these claims and proceedings individually and in the aggregate and allocates additional monies for potential losses on such litigation if it is possible to estimate the amount of loss and if the amount of the loss is probable. We are not currently involved in any litigation nor to our knowledge, is any litigation threatened against us, the outcome of which would, in our judgment based on information currently available to us, have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which is available at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.cyclotherapeutics.com .

We do not undertake to update any of the "forward-looking" statements or to announce the results of any revisions to these "forward-looking" statements except as required by law.
