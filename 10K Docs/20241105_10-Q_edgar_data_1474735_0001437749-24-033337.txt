New Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Changes to GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") in the form of accounting standard updates ("ASUs") to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"). 
 
 In March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted a final rule under SEC Release No. 33 - 11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, to enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures. The rule will require companies to disclose material Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions; climate-related risks, governance, and oversight; and the financial effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions. These disclosures will begin to be phased in beginning with the Company's annual report for the year ending December 31, 2025. While this rule has been stayed pending the outcome of legal challenges, the Company is currently assessing the impact of adoption on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in the event the stay is lifted. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023 - 09 Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . The ASU establishes new income tax disclosure requirements in addition to modifying and eliminating certain existing requirements. Under the new guidance, the Company must consistently categorize and provide greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation. It must also further disaggregate income taxes paid. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. Entities may apply the amendments prospectively or may elect retrospective application. The Company is evaluating the impact of the new required disclosures but do not expect the adoption of ASU 2023 - 09 to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023 - 07 Segment Reporting - Improving Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280 . The update is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant expenses. The ASU requires disclosures to include significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), a description of other segment items by reportable segment, and any additional measures of a segment's profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU also requires all annual disclosures currently required by Topic 280 to be included in interim periods. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is evaluating the impact of the new required disclosures but do not expect the adoption of ASU 2023 - 07 to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 
 
 There have been no other recent accounting pronouncements, changes in accounting pronouncements, or recently adopted accounting guidance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that are of significance or potential significance to the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 

, net of cash acquired and inclusive of holdbacks and estimated contingent consideration. The Company recorded its preliminary purchase price allocation based on its estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Purchase accounting for C I BESS and Huntington will be finalized prior to June 30, 2025, while purchase accounting for Ageto will be finalized prior to September 30, 2025. There have not been any material changes to the preliminary purchase price allocation for Ageto, C I BESS, or Huntington as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of Ageto, C I BESS, and Huntington from their dates of acquisition through September 30, 2024. Pro forma and other financial information are not presented as the effects of these acquisitions are not material to the Company's results of operations or financial position. 
 
 Fiscal 2023 Acquisitions 
 
 On February 1, 2023, the Company acquired REFUstor, headquartered in Pfullingen, Germany. REFUstor is a developer and supplier of battery storage hardware products, advanced software, and platform services for the C I energy storage market. 
 
 The Company recorded its preliminary purchase price allocation for REFUstor during the first quarter of 2023, based on its estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Purchase accounting for REFUstor was finalized in the first quarter of 2024 and did not result in material adjustments to the Company's preliminary estimates. The final purchase price is not material to the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of REFUstor from the date of acquisition through September 30, 2024. Pro forma and other financial information are not presented as the effects of the REFUstor acquisition are not material to the Company's results of operations or financial position. 

ownership interest in PR Industrial S.r.l. and its subsidiaries (Pramac). The noncontrolling interest in Pramac had an acquisition date fair value of and was recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets, as the noncontrolling interest holder had within its control the right to require the Company to redeem its interest in Pramac. In May 2021, the Company exercised its call option rights and paid a purchase price of to purchase an additional ownership interest in Pramac, bringing the Company's total ownership interest in Pramac to . On March 8, 2023, the Company and the noncontrolling interest holder entered into an agreement whereby the Company acquired the remaining ownership interest in Pramac for a purchase price of , which brought the Company's total ownership interest in Pramac to . The purchase price included of initial consideration (which included a cash payment of and a gain on a foreign currency settlement in the first quarter of 2023 and of contingent deferred consideration to be paid in up to restricted shares that were issued based on the twenty day volume weighted average price of the Company s stock ending on December 31, 2022, and which shall vest upon achievement of certain earnings targets at the end of the earn-out period, December 31, 2025. 
 
 On February 1, 2019, the Company acquired a ownership interest in Captiva Energy Solutions Private Limited (Captiva). The noncontrolling interest in Captiva had an acquisition date fair value of and was recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets, as the noncontrolling interest holder had within its control the right to require the Company to redeem its interest in Captiva. The noncontrolling interest holder had a put option to sell his interest to the Company any time after five years from the date of acquisition, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Further, the Company had a call option that may be redeemed any time after five years from the date of acquisition, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. The put and call option price was based on a multiple of earnings, subject to the terms of the acquisition agreement. In May 2022, the Company purchased an additional ownership interest in Captiva for , which was paid with cash on hand, bringing the Company's total ownership interest in Captiva to . On April 5, 2024, the Company acquired the remaining ownership interest in Captiva for . 
 
 The above redeemable noncontrolling interests were recorded at the greater of the initial fair value, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interests share of comprehensive income (loss), or the estimated redemption value, with any adjustments to the redemption value impacting retained earnings, but not net income. However, the redemption value adjustments are reflected in the earnings per share calculation, as detailed in Note 13, Earnings Per Share, to the condensed consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the changes in the redeemable noncontrolling interest for both Captiva and Pramac:

interest rate swap agreements, the final four of which expired in May 2023. In March 2020, the Company entered into three additional interest rate swap agr eements, which were still outstanding as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 In June 2022, in conjunction with the amendments to the Company's credit agreements discussed further in Note 11, Credit Agreements, to the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company amended its interest rate swaps to match the underlying debt and reconfirmed hedge effectiveness. The Company formally documented all relationships between interest rate hedging instruments and the related hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions. These interest rate swap agreements qualify as cash flow hedges and therefore, the effective portions of their gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCL") in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The amount of losses, net of tax, recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, wa s ) and ), respec tively. The amount of gains, net of tax, recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was and , respectively. The cash flows of the swaps are recognized as adjustments to interest expense each period. The ineffective portions of the derivatives changes in fair value, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. 
 
 Stock Warrants 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company entered into a agreement with Wallbox N.V. ("Wallbox") to purchase of its Class A common stock ("Wallbox Shares") and acquire stock warrants, which provide the rights to an incremental approximate ownership in the Class A common stock outstanding of Wallbox upon exercise at a fixed price with anti-dilution protections for a period of ti me. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company received additional warrants in connection with an additional round of funding performed by Wallbox through the Company's anti-dilution protection rights. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company is required to adjust the carrying value of these warrants to market value on a quarterly basis. Gains and losses attributable to the stock warrants are recognized in other expense, net in the c ondensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
 
 The gain attributable to the stock warrants was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the receipt of additional warrants during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Fair Value 
 
 The following table presents the fair value of all the Company s derivatives: 
 Interest rate swaps 
 Stock warrants 

In the condensed consolidated balance sheets, the fair value of the foreign currency contracts is includ ed in other accrued liabilities at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The fair value of the interest rate swaps and stock warrants is included in operating lease and other assets at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Excluding the impact of credit ris k, the fair value of the derivative contracts (excluding the stock warrants) as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, i s an asset of and , respectively, which represents the amount the Company would receive to exit all of the agreements on those dates. 

, was (Level 2 on September 30, 2024. The fair value of the Tranche A Term Loan borrowing, which has a net carrying value of , was (Level 2 on September 30, 2024. These fair values were calculated based on independent valuations which contain inputs and significant value drivers that are observable. The fair value of the Revolving Facility approximates the carrying value. 
 
 For the fair value of the derivatives measured on a recurring basis, refer to the fair value table in Note 4, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the condensed consolidated financial statements. The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps and commodity and foreign currency derivative contracts are classified as Level 2. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of these derivative contracts, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The fair value of the derivative contracts discussed above considers the Company s credit risk in accordance with ASC 820 - 10. 
 
 The fair value of the Wallbox stock warrants is classified as Level 3. The fair value of these contracts is measured using a Black Scholes option pricing model, with significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data as well as internal estimates, specifically the time period until exercise. The warrants received in the third quarter of 2024 and fourth quarter of 2023 expire at the earlier of when the price per share equals or exceeds or in 2028 and 2029, respectively. The time period until exercise assumption has a significant impact on the fair value of the warrants. 
 
 Equity Securities 
 
 Equity securities consist of Wallbox Shares. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company invested an incremental in additional Wallbox Shares, increasing its ownership interest to Wallbox Shares as of September 30, 2024. The Wallbox Shares are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy and are recognized at fair value using the closing price of Wallbox common stock quoted on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on the last trading day of the quarter. The Wallbox Shares are included in operating lease and other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Wallbox Shares was and as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Gains and losses attributable to the Wallbox Shares are recognized in other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The loss recognized on the Wallbox Shares was ) and ) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Contingent Consideration 
 
 Certain of the Company's business combinations involve potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones. As part of purchase accounting, a liability is recorded for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period, and the change in fair value is recognized within general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The fair value measurement of contingent consideration is typically categorized as a Level 3 liability, as the measurement amount is based primarily on significant inputs that are not observable in the market. 
 
 The fair value of contingent consideration for Chilicon Power LLC ("Chilicon"), Pramac, and Ageto as of September 30, 2024, and for Chilicon and Pramac as of December 31, 2023, was and , respectively. The contingent consideration period for Chilicon extends through December 31, 2028, while the contingent consideration period for Pramac extends through December 31, 2025. The contingent consideration for Ageto can be earned in equal increments with one third of the contingent consideration capable of being earned as of August 1, 2025, August 1, 2026, and August 1, 2027. The current portion of contingent consideration is reported in other accrued liabilities and the non-current portion is reported in other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of the activity for contingent consideration:

Central to these ecosystems are the Company s next-generation connectivity devices, controls capabilities, and software platforms that facilitate the integration of our products and support the growing utilization of such distributed energy resources ("DERs") in grid services programs. In addition, we have been leveraging our leading position in the growing market for natural gas fueled generators, which we believe represents a cleaner transition fuel compared to diesel, to expand into applications beyond standby power, allowing us to participate in Energy-as-a-Service and microgrid projects for C I customers. As the traditional centralized utility model evolves over time, we believe that a more decarbonized, digitized, and decentralized grid infrastructure will develop, and Generac s energy technology solutions are uniquely and strategically positioned to participate in this next-generation grid referred to as Grid 2.0 . 
 
 As our traditional power generation markets continue to grow due to multiple mega-trends that are driving increased penetration of our products, we believe we are in an excellent position to execute on this opportunity given our competitive strengths. In addition, our focus on more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy solutions has dramatically increased our served addressable market, and as a result, we believe that Generac is well positioned for success over the long-term.

Mega-Trends, Strategic Growth Themes, and Additional Business Drivers 
 
 In 2021, we unveiled our Powering A Smarter World strategic plan, which serves as the framework for the significant investments we have made and will continue to make to capitalize on the long-term growth prospects of Generac. Our enterprise strategy is based on the combination of several key mega-trends that we believe will drive several significant strategic growth themes for our business. 
 
 Key Mega-Trends: 

Grid 2.0 : which is the evolution of the traditional electrical utility model as the increasing reliance on intermittent renewable generation sources and the electrification of everything are leading to supply/demand imbalances and rising electricity costs, driving the migration towards distributed energy resources and decarbonization, digitization, and decentralization of the grid. 

Impact of climate change: which includes the expectation of more severe and volatile weather driving increased power outage activity, and more global regulation accelerating renewable investments. 

Home as a Sanctuary: which includes the trend of the increasing importance of the home including more people working from home and aging in place is leading to increasing sensitivity to power outages and need for peace of mind, combined with the more intelligent and connected home and desire for improved energy resiliency and efficiency.

Emergence of cleaner alternative fuels: natural gas as compared to diesel, and other alternative fuels, are important elements in the transition to a lower-carbon global energy supply. 

Growing investment in global infrastructure creating new opportunities: Upgrading of aging and underinvested legacy systems including transportation, power, healthcare and elderly care; along with expanding investment for increasingly critical technology infrastructure including data centers, telecom and EV charging. 

Strategic Growth Themes: 
 
 Power quality issues continue to increase . Power disruptions are an important driver of consumer awareness for back-up power and have historically influenced demand for generators both in the United States and internationally. Increased frequency and duration of major power outage events, that have a broader impact beyond a localized level, increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period, which we believe may last for six to twelve months following a major outage event. Energy storage systems offer similar resiliency advantages to consumers and can benefit from these same awareness drivers, at least for short duration power outages. The optional standby market for C I power generation is also driven by power quality issues and the related need for backup power. Attitudes around climate change have shifted and undergone increased global focus in recent years, and an aging and underinvested electrical grid infrastructure remains highly vulnerable to the expectation of more severe and volatile weather. Additionally, rapid growth in renewable power sources such as solar and wind is resulting in increased intermittency of supply, further impairing the reliable supply of electricity at a time when demand is starting to increase meaningfully with the electrification of a wide range of consumer and commercial products, including transportation, HVAC systems, and other major appliances. These developments are causing a growing supply/demand imbalance for grid operators across North America, which has led to high-profile examples of rolling blackouts and calls for utility customers to reduce consumption to maintain grid integrity. In fact, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation has labeled significant portions of the United States and Canada as being at high risk of resource adequacy shortfalls during normal seasonal peak conditions in the 2024-2028 period due in part to these supply/demand dynamics. We are seeing increasing evidence that warnings of potential resource inadequacies are driving incremental consumer awareness of the need for backup power solutions. We believe utility supply shortfalls and related warnings may continue in the future, further expanding awareness of deteriorating power quality in North America. Taken together, we expect these factors to continue driving increased awareness of the need for backup power and demand for Generac s products within multiple categories. 
 
 Home standby penetration opportunity is significant . Many potential customers are still not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions. With only approximately 6.25 penetration of the addressable market of homes in the United States (which we define as single-family detached, owner-occupied households with a home value of over 150,000, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau's 2021 American Housing Survey for the United States), we believe there are significant opportunities to further penetrate the residential standby generator market both domestically and internationally. We believe by expanding our distribution network, continuing to develop our product lines, and targeting our marketing efforts, we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our home standby generators. 
 
 Solar, storage, and energy management markets are developing quickly . We believe the electric utility landscape will undergo significant changes in the decade ahead due to rising utility rates, grid instability and power quality issues, environmental concerns, and the continuing performance and cost improvements in renewable energy and energy storage technologies. On-site power generation from renewable sources and cleaner-burning natural gas generators are projected to become more prevalent as will the need to monitor, manage, and store this power potentially developing into a significant market opportunity. While the market for residential solar and storage products continues to be soft in 2024, these markets are receiving an increasing level of regulatory and legislative support, most notably from the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed in 2022. This legislation includes significant subsidies and investment tax credits for consumers and businesses over the coming decade, as well as production tax credits for businesses that meet certain domestic manufacturing requirements in the production of renewable energy products. For example, in July 2024, we received a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to facilitate the installation of residential solar and battery storage systems for disadvantaged Puerto Rican residents. We believe legislative support such as this will provide necessary opportunity for long-term, value-creating investments for market participants in this space. We expect to further advance our capabilities in energy technology by increasing our product development, sourcing, distribution, and marketing efforts. In addition, we should be able to leverage our significant competencies in the residential standby generator market to build our market position in the emerging residential solar, storage, and energy management markets.

Energy-as-a-Service models, beyond standby applications, and energy services open new market opportunities . We expect the evolution of the traditional electrical utility model toward decarbonized, digitized, and decentralized solutions will continue to drive the need for grid operators to access and control DERs. This will require highly intelligent software platforms that are able to optimize an increasingly complex supply and demand equation, such as our Concerto Distributed Energy Resource Management System ("DERMS") software platform. Additionally, growing interest in our C I products across a variety of beyond standby applications is driving an increase in demand for subscription-like models for end customers, in which Generac will partner with third parties to deliver resiliency solutions that are also able to contribute to grid stability with minimal upfront capital outlays. We also believe that we can gain share in the C I behind the meter energy storage market, including microgrid applications that require advanced system-level controls. The significant advancements made in recent years in the connectivity of our products are core to these newer capabilities, which play a key role in the evolution of Generac into an energy technology solutions company. 
 
 Natural gas generators, a continuing growth opportunity . We believe natural gas will continue to be an important and cleaner transition fuel of the future, in comparison to diesel in the C I market, as the world continues to shift towards lower emission power generation sources. Demand for natural gas generators continues to represent an increasing portion of the overall C I market, which we believe will continue to grow at a faster rate than traditional diesel fueled generators. We also continue to explore and expand our capabilities within new gaseous generator market opportunities, including continuous-duty, prime rated, distributed generation, demand response, microgrids, and overall use as a distributed energy resource in areas where grid stability is needed. Many of these applications are made possible by our natural gas generators having the capability to participate in available grid services programs, helping to offset the purchase price of the equipment over the product s lifespan. Expanding our natural gas product offering into larger power nodes is also a part of this growth theme in taking advantage of the continuing shift from diesel to natural gas generators. 
 
 Increasingly critical nature and growing power consumption of digital infrastructure . As the number of connected devices continues to rapidly increase and wireless networks are considered critical infrastructure in the United States, network reliability and up-time are necessary for our increasingly connected society. This will require highly resilient cell tower sites across the network, and therefore necessitates the need for backup power sources on site at these cell towers. Generac is the leading supplier of backup power to the telecommunications market in the United States, where approximately half of all existing tower sites have yet to be "hardened" with backup power. As more mission-critical data is transmitted over wireless networks, we believe this penetration rate must increase considerably to maintain a higher level of reliability across the network. We have relationships with key Tier 1 carriers and tower companies globally, in addition to having the distribution partners to provide service support to the global market. We believe these factors coupled with Generac s ability to customize solutions to each customer s needs help us to maintain our strength within the global telecommunications market. 
 
 Additionally, the rapid increase in data centers is driving increased demand for backup power solutions, given the critical nature of this infrastructure. AI requirements, hyperscalers, and the expansion of edge computing and connected devices are expected to double data center power consumption from 2022 to 2030. We believe this significant growth in power consumption, as well as the increasing dependency of society on this next-generation digital infrastructure, will drive demand for backup power and intelligent energy management solutions, both at the individual site level and for the broader electrical grid. 
 
 Other Business Drivers 
 
 Impact of residential investment cycle. The market for a number of our residential products is affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer confidence and sentiment. When homeowners are confident of their household income, the value of their home and overall net worth, they are more likely to invest in their home. These trends can have an impact on demand for residential generators, energy storage systems, and energy management devices. Trends in the new housing market, highlighted by residential housing starts, can also impact demand for these products. Demand for outdoor power equipment is also impacted by several of these factors, as well as weather patterns. The existence of renewable energy mandates, investment tax credits and other subsidies, which have become even more prevalent with the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act, can also have an impact on the demand for solar and energy storage systems. 
 
 Impact of business capital investment and other economic cycles. The global market for our C I products is affected by different capital investment cycles, which can vary widely across the different regions and markets that we serve. These cycles include non-residential building construction, durable goods and infrastructure spending, as well as investments in the exploration and production of oil gas, as businesses or organizations either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations or equipment. These trends and market conditions can have a material impact on demand for our products. For example, the market for telecom and rental equipment has declined in 2024 relative to 2023 levels. The capital investment cycle may differ for the various C I end ma rkets that we serve, including light commercial, retail, office, telecommunications, rental, industrial, data centers, healthcare, construction, oil gas and municipal infrastructure, among others. The market for these products is also affected by general economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates, and geopolitical matters in the various countries where we serve, as well as credit availability in those regions.

Factors A ffecting R esults of O perations 
 
 We are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations, which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control, including continued product development, expanded distribution, pricing, cost control, and hedging. Certain operational and other factors that affect our business include the following: 
 
 Effect of commodity, currency, component price fluctuations, and resource availability. Industry-wide price fluctuations of key commodities, such as steel, copper and aluminum, along with other components we use in our products, as well as changes in labor costs required to produce our products, can have a material impact on our results of operations. Acquisitions in recent years have increased our use of advanced electronic components and battery cells, as well as further expanded our commercial and operational presence outside of the United States. Our international acquisitions, along with our existing global supply chain, expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and regulatory tariffs that can also have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 
 We have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of any inflationary pressures through improved product design and sourcing, manufacturing efficiencies, price increases, and select hedging transactions. Our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates, which in some cases are accepted by our customers and in other cases are paid by us. 
 
 Seasonality. Although there is demand for our products throughout the year, in each of the past five years, approximately 19 to 25 of our net sales occurred in the first quarter, 22 to 28 in the second quarter, 24 to 28 in the third quarter and 23 to 31 in the fourth quarter, with different seasonality depending primarily on the occurrence, timing and severity of major power outage activity in each year. Major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and, as a result, our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period . The seasonality experienced during a major power outage, and for the subsequent quarters following the event, will vary relative to other periods where no major outage events occurred. 
 
 Geopolitical Conflict. Current global conflicts, such as those between Russia and Ukraine as well as the Middle East crisis between Hamas and Israel, have created substantial uncertainty in the global economy, including sanctions and penalties imposed on certain countries from several governments. While we do not have a significant physical presence in these locations and do not have significant direct exposure to customers and vendors in those countries, we are unable to predict the impact that these actions will have on the global economy or on our future financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 Acquisitions. Over the years, we have executed a number of acquisitions that support our strategic plan. A summary of the recent acquisitions can be found in Note 1, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in Item 8 (Note 1, Description of Business of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Factors Influencing Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense can be impacted by a variety of factors, including market fluctuations in SOFR, interest rate election periods, interest rate swap agreements, repayments or borrowings of indebtedness, and amendments to our credit agreements. In connection with our credit agreement amendment in June 2022, SOFR became the new benchmark interest rate for the new Tranche A Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility, and all LIBOR provisions in the existing Tranche B Term Loan Facility were replaced with SOFR provisions. Refer to Note 11, Credit Agreements, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 
 Factors Influencing Provision for Income Taxes and Cash Income Taxes Paid 
 
 The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily driven by certain unfavorable discrete tax items in the prior-year comparable period which did not repeat in the current year. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (the "Act"). The Act in part provides funding and tax incentives for certain clean energy products and projects. While the Act did not have a material impact on the financial results of the current period, we will continue to review the Act and any regulations or guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department or by a state which may provide a tax benefit or expense. 
 
 In 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") released Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion model rules, designed to ensure large corporations are taxed at a minimum rate of 15 in all countries of operation. The OECD continues to release guidance and countries are implementing legislation to adopt the rules, some of which became effective on January 1, 2024. The United States has not yet enacted legislation implementing Pillar Two. We are continuing to evaluate the Pillar Two rules and their potential impact on future periods. There was no impact to the financial results of the current period, and we do not expect the rules to have a material impact on our effective tax rate for the year. We will update our future tax provisions based on new regulations or guidance accordingly.

Net sales. Domestic segment total sales (including inter-segment sales) increased 14 to 1,020.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 894.0 million in the prior-year third quarter, including a slight benefit from acquisitions. This was primarily driven by strong shipments of home standby and portable generators, as well as continued growth in C I product sales to industrial distributors, partially offset by lower C I product shipments for telecom, rental, and beyond standby applications. 
 
 International segment total sales (including inter-segment sales) decreased 20 to 166.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 207.6 million in the prior-year third quarter, including a slight unfavorable impact from foreign currency. The total sales decline was primarily due to lower inter-segment sales related to softness in the telecom market and a decline in shipments of portable generators and C I products in Europe due to weaker market conditions. 
 
 In addition, total contribution from non-annualized acquisitions for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.5 million for the domestic segment. 
 
 Gross profit. Gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 40.2 , as compared to 35.1 in the prior-year third quarter. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by favorable sales mix given stronger home standby shipments and lower input costs. 
 
 Operating Expenses. Operating expenses increased 32.6 million, or 12.0 , as compared to the prior-year third quarter . The growth in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased employee costs to support future growth, additional marketing spend to drive incremental awareness for our products, and higher variable expenses and incentive compensation given higher shipment volumes and profitability. This was partially offset by a 22.1 million provision for certain legal matters recorded in the prior year which did not repeat in the current year (see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information). 
 
 Other Expense. The decrease in other expense, net was driven primarily by a decrease in interest expense due to lower borrowings and lower interest rates compared to the prior-year third quarter. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a gain on the change in fair value of our investment in warrants and equity securities of Wallbox of 5.2 million, partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of 4.9 million related to the refinancing of our Tranche B Term Loan Facility. 
 
 Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes for the third quarter of 2024 was 33.5 million, or an effective tax rate of 22.7 , as compared to 19.4 million, or a 24.3 effective tax rate, for the prior-year third quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily driven by certain unfavorable discrete tax items in the prior year quarter that did not repeat in the current year quarter. 
 
 Net income attributable to Generac Holdings Inc. Net income attributable to Generac Holdings Inc. in the third quarter of 2024 was 113.7 million compared to 60.4 million in the prior-year third quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the factors outlined above. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the domestic segment in the third quarter of 2024 was 211.6 million, or 20.7 of domestic segment total sales, as compared to 160.3 million, or 17.9 of total sales, in the prior-year third quarter. This margin improvement was primarily due to favorable sales mix and lower input costs, partially offset by higher operating expense investments to support future growth initiatives. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the international segment in the third quarter of 2024, before deducting for non-controlling interests, was 20.3 million, or 12.2 of international segment total sales, as compared to 28.3 million, or 13.6 of total sales, in the prior-year third quarter. This margin decline was primarily due to reduced operating leverage on lower shipments during the quarter. 
 
 Adjusted Net Income. Adjusted Net Income in the third quarter of 2024 was 135.6 million compared to 101.9 million in the prior-year third quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher net income in the current period as outlined above, partially offset by certain add backs as detailed in "Non-GAAP Measures" 
 
 See Non-GAAP Measures for a discussion of how we calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income and the limitations on their usefulness.

Net sales. Domestic segment total sales (including inter-segment sales) increased 6 to 2,567.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to 2,429.3 million in the prior-year comparable period, including a slight benefit from acquisitions. Higher home standby and portable generator shipments were partially offset by lower C I product shipments for telecom, rental, and "beyond standby" applications. 
 
 International segment total sales (including inter-segment sales) decreased 17 to 537.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to 647.8 million in the prior-year comparable period, including a slight benefit from foreign currency and acquisitions. The total sales decline for the segment was primarily driven by lower inter-segment sales related to softness in the telecom market and a decline in shipments of portable generators and C I products in Europe due to weaker market conditions. 
 
 In addition, total contribution from non-annualized acquisitions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 8.4 million, including 7.3 million for the domestic segment and 1.1 million for the international segment. 
 
 Gross profit. Gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 38.0 , as compared to 33.0 in the prior-year comparable period. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily driven by favorable sales mix, including higher home standby generator sales, and the realization of lower cost of goods sold. 
 
 Operating Expenses. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 84.0 million, or 11.3 , as compared to the prior-year comparable period. The operating expenses in the current period include 4.9 million of charges related to certain legal matters (see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information). The operating expenses in the prior-year comparable period include 22.1 million of charges related to certain legal matters referenced previously and a 5.8 million provision for a matter with the CPSC (see Note 15, "Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information). The remaining growth in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased employee costs to support future growth and higher marketing spend to drive incremental awareness for our products, and higher variable expenses and incentive compensation given higher shipment volumes and profitability. 
 
 Other Expense. The increase in other expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was driven primarily by a 4.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt and a 2.9 million expense for the change in fair value of our investment in warrants and equity securities of Wallbox. This was partially offset by an increase of 2.5 million in investment income driven by higher interest rates on cash invested and a decrease of 3.0 million in interest expense driven by decreased borrowings compared to the prior-year comparable period. 
 
 Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 65.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 24.6 , as compared to 43.2 million, or a 26.4 effective tax rate in the prior-year comparable period. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily driven by certain unfavorable discrete tax items in the prior-year comparable period which did not repeat in the current year. 
 
 Net income attributable to Generac Holdings Inc. Net income attributable to Generac Holdings Inc. for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 199.1 million as compared to 118.0 million in the prior-year comparable period. This increase was primarily driven by the factors outlined above. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the domestic segment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 450.4 million or 17.5 of total domestic segment sales as compared to 331.1 million or 13.6 in the prior-year comparable period. This margin improvement was primarily driven by favorable sales mix and the realization of lower cost of goods sold, partially offset by higher operating expense investments to support future growth initiatives. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the international segment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, before deducting for non-controlling interests, was 73.4 million, or 13.6 of international segment total sales, as compared to 94.1 million or 14.5 of total sales, in the prior-year comparable period. This margin decrease was primarily due to reduced operating leverage on lower shipments during the nine-month period. 
 
 Adjusted Net Income . Adjusted Net Income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 270.2 million compared to 209.1 million in the prior-year comparable period. This increase was primarily driven by higher net income in the current period as outlined above, partially offset by certain add backs as detailed in "Non-GAAP Measures". 
 
 See Non-GAAP Measures for a discussion of how we calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income and the limitations on their usefulness.

Liquidity and F inancial Condition 
 
 Our primary cash requirements include payment for raw materials and components, salaries and benefits, facility and lease costs, operating expenses, interest and principal payments on debt, and capital expenditures. We finance our operations primarily from cash flow generated from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
 
 Our credit agreements originally provided for a 1,200.0 million Tranche B Term Loan Facility original Term Loan B Facility and included a 300.0 million uncommitted incremental term loan on that facility. The original Term Loan B Facility initially bore interest at rates based on either a base rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75 or adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75 , subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.75 . After several amendments, the previous Term Loan B Facility bore interest at rates based on either a base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.75 or adjusted SOFR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75 , subject to a SOFR floor of 0.0 . 
 
 In July 2024, we extinguished the 530.0 million balance then outstanding under the former Tranche B Term Loan Facility and replaced it with a new 500.0 million Tranche B Term Loan Facility maturing on July 3, 2031. The new Tranche B Term Loan Facility continues to include a 300.0 million uncommitted incremental term loan on that facility. In accordance with ASC 470-50, we capitalized 3.0 million of debt issuance costs. Additionally, we wrote-off the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the former Tranche B Term Loan Facility of 4.3 million and expensed 0.6 million of fees paid to creditors as a loss on extinguishment of debt. As of September 30, 2024, the Tranche B Term Loan Facility bears interest at the adjusted SOFR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75 , subject to a SOFR floor of 0.0 , resulting in a 6.95 combined rate as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Tranche B Term Loan Facility does not require an Excess Cash Flow payment (as defined in our Amended Credit Agreement) if our net secured leverage ratio is maintained below 3.75 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2024, our net secured leverage ratio was 1.70 to 1.00, and we were in compliance with all covenants of the Tranche B Term Loan Facility. There are no financial maintenance covenants on the Tranche B Term Loan Facility. 
 
 In June 2022, we amended and restated our existing credit agreements ("Amended Credit Agreement") resulting in a new term loan A facility in an aggregate principal amount of 750.0 million ("Tranche A Term Loan Facility"), established a new 1,250.0 million Revolving Facility, and replaced all LIBOR provisions with SOFR provisions. The Tranche A Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility initially bore interest at a rate based on adjusted SOFR plus an applicable margin of 1.5 through December 31, 2022, subject to a SOFR floor of 0.0 . Beginning on January 1, 2023, the Tranche A Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate based on adjusted SOFR plus an applicable margin between 1.25 and 1.75 , based on the Company's total leverage ratio and subject to a SOFR floor of 0.0 , resulting in a 6.93 combined interest rate for the Tranche A Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Tranche A Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility contain certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a total leverage ratio below 3.75 to 1.00 as well as an interest coverage ratio above 3.00 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2024, our total leverage ratio was 1.79 to 1.00, and our interest coverage ratio was 8.69 to 1.00. We were also in compliance with all other covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Tranche B Term Loan Facility, Tranche A Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries and are secured by associated collateral agreements which pledge a first priority lien on virtually all of our assets, including fixed assets and intangibles, cash, trade accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets and proceeds thereof. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was 150.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility, leaving 1,099.2 million of unused capacity, net of outstanding letters of credit. 
 
 The Tranche A Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility mature on June 29, 2027. The Tranche A Term Loan Facility is repayable in installments maturing at the end of each quarter commencing September 2023, with a balloon payment due June 2027. The Tranche B Term Loan Facility matures on July 3, 2031, and is repayable in installments maturing at the end of each quarter commencing September 2024, with a balloon payment due July 2031. Maturities of our Tranche A Term Loan Facility, Tranche B Term Loan Facility, and Revolving Facility outstanding on September 30, 2024, are as follows:

As of September 30, 2024, we had total liquidity of 1,313.4 million which consists of 214.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and 1,099.2 million available under our Revolving Facility. We believe we have a strong liquidity position that allows us to execute our strategic plan and provides the flexibility to continue to invest in future growth opportunities. 

In July 2022, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, which commenced on August 5, 2022, and allowed for the repurchase of up to 500.0 million of our common stock over a 24-month period. Additionally, on February 12, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to 500.0 million of our common stock over the following 24 months. The new program replaces the prior share repurchase program, which had 26.3 million remaining available for repurchase when the new program was approved. Pursuant to the approved program, we may repurchase our common stock from time to time, in amounts and at prices we deem appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. The repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated agreements or other transactions. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by management at its discretion and in compliance with the terms of our credit agreements. The repurchases may be funded with cash on hand, available borrowings, or proceeds from potential debt or other capital markets sources. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. 

During the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased 690,711 shares of our common stock for 102.1 million. During the second quarter of 2024, we repurchased 355,640 shares of our common stock for 50.6 million. There were no share repurchases under the program during the first quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2023, we repurchased 875,580 shares of our common stock for 100.3 million. There were no share repurchases during the first and second quarters of 2023. We have periodically reissued shares out of Treasury stock, including for acquisition contingent consideration payments. 
 
 See Note 11, Credit Agreements, and Note 12, "Stock Repurchase Program," to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on our credit agreements and stock repurchase programs. 
 
 We have an arrangement with a finance company to provide floor plan financing for qualifying dealers. This arrangement provides liquidity for our dealers by financing dealer purchases of Generac products with credit availability from the finance company. We receive payment from the finance company after shipment of product to the dealer, and our dealers are given a longer period of time to pay the finance company. If our dealers do not pay the finance company, we may be required to repurchase the applicable inventory held by the dealer. We do not indemnify the finance company for any credit losses they may incur. Total dealer purchases financed under this arrangement accounted for approximately 12 and 17 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The amount financed by dealers which remained outstanding was 146.4 million and 158.0 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Long-term L iquidity 
 
 We believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and availability under our Revolving Facility and other short-term lines of credit will provide us with sufficient capital to continue to run our operations. We may use a portion of our cash flow for debt repayments and common stock buybacks, impacting the amount available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. As we continue to expand our business, we may require additional capital to fund other shareholder value enhancing activities.

The increase in operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by higher operating earnings coupled with a decrease in working capital in the current year period and an increase in working capital in the prior-year comparable period. 
 
 The 141.8 million net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily represents cash payments of 83.4 million related to the purchase of property and equipment, 21.8 million for the acquisitions of Huntington, C I BESS, and Ageto, 1.6 million for a tax equity investment, and 35 million for an incremental minority investment in Wallbox. 
 
 The 98.4 million net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily represents cash payments of 77.7 million related to the purchase of property and equipment, 16.0 million for the acquisition of REFUstor, and 6.6 million for a tax equity investment. 
 
 The 246.6 million net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily represents proceeds of 29.2 million from short-term borrowings, 506.5 million from long-term borrowings, and 12.4 million from the exercise of stock options. These cash proceeds were more than offset by 609.5 million of debt repayments 48.9 million of short-term borrowings and 560.6 million of long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations), 152.7 million of share repurchases, a 9.1 million payment for the remaining ownership interest in Captiva, a 6.0 million payment and 1.4 million payment of deferred acquisition consideration related to our Chilicon and Blue Pillar acquisitions, respectively, 12.3 million for taxes paid related to equity awards, and a 3.6 million of payments for debt issuance costs related to our Tranche B Term Loan Facility refinancing. 
 
 The 77.6 million net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily represents proceeds of 345.4 million from long-term borrowings, 49.1 million from short-term borrowings, and 7.1 million from the exercise of stock options. These cash proceeds were more than offset by 104.8 million in cash payments used to purchase the remaining ownership interest in Pramac, 100.3 million used for stock repurchases, 259.0 million of debt repayments 25.9 million of short-term borrowings and 233.1 million of long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations), 10.1 million of taxes paid related to equity awards, and 5.0 million for payment of contingent acquisition consideration. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations between the February 21, 2024, filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2024, except for the changes in outstanding borrowings and interest rates as discussed in Note 11, Credit Agreements, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Critical A ccounting P olicies and Estimates 
 
 As discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, in preparing the financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset, liability, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the Company, including information about contingencies, risk and financial condition. The Company believes, given current facts and circumstances, its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, adhere to U.S. GAAP, and are consistently applied. Inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates, and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise. The Company makes routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, prepaid expenses, product warranties and other reserves. Management believes the Company s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas: goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment; business combinations and purchase accounting; and income taxes. 
 
 There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies since the February 21, 2024, filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Non-GAAP M easures 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide the computation of Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Company, which is defined as net income before noncontrolling interests adjusted for the following items: interest expense, depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, income tax expense, certain non-cash gains and losses including certain purchase accounting adjustments and contingent consideration adjustments, share-based compensation expense, certain transaction costs and credit facility fees, business optimization expenses, provision for certain legal and regulatory charges, certain specific provisions, mark-to-market gains and losses on a minority investment, and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests, as set forth in the reconciliation table below. The computation of Adjusted EBITDA is based primarily on the definition included in our Credit Agreement. 
 
 We view Adjusted EBITDA as a key measure of our performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA not only due to its importance for purposes of our credit agreements but also because it assists us in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis as it excludes items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA: 

for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and developing and refining our internal projections for future periods; 

to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business; 

as a benchmark for the determination of the bonus component of compensation for our senior executives under our management incentive plan, as described further in our 2023 Proxy Statement; 

to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and as a supplemental tool in evaluating our performance against our budget for each period; and 

in communications with our Board of Directors and investors concerning our financial performance. 

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company. Management believes the disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA offers an additional financial metric that, when coupled with results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors for the following reasons: 

Adjusted EBITDA and similar non-GAAP measures are widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon financing and accounting methods, book values of assets, tax jurisdictions, capital structures, and the methods by which assets were acquired; 

investors can use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of the Company, including our ability to service our debt and other cash needs; and 

by comparing our Adjusted EBITDA in different historical periods, our investors can evaluate our operating performance excluding the impact of items described below. 

The adjustments included in the reconciliation table listed below are presented to illustrate the operating performance of our business in a manner consistent with the presentation used by our management and Board of Directors. These adjustments eliminate the impact of a number of items that: 

we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance, such as non-cash write-downs and other charges, non-cash gains, write-offs relating to the retirement of debt, severance costs, and other restructuring-related business optimization expenses; 

we believe to be akin to, or associated with, interest expense, such as administrative agent fees, revolving credit facility commitment fees, and letter of credit fees; or 

are non-cash in nature, such as share-based compensation. 

We explain in more detail in footnotes (a) through (g) below why we believe these adjustments are useful in calculating Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of our operating performance. 

25

Table of Contents 

Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations are: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our capital expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 

several of the adjustments that we use in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, such as non-cash write-downs and other charges, while not involving cash expense, do have a negative impact on the value of our assets as reflected in our consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP; and 

other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

Furthermore, as noted above, one of our uses of Adjusted EBITDA is as a benchmark for determining elements of compensation for our senior executives. At the same time, some or all of these senior executives have responsibility for monitoring our financial results, generally including the adjustments in calculating Adjusted EBITDA (subject ultimately to review by our Board of Directors in the context of the Board's review of our quarterly financial statements). While many of the adjustments (for example, transaction costs and credit facility fees) involve mathematical application of items reflected in our financial statements, others involve a degree of judgment and discretion. While we believe all of these adjustments are appropriate, and while the quarterly calculations are subject to review by our Board of Directors in the context of the Board's review of our quarterly financial statements and certification by our Chief Financial Officer in a compliance certificate provided to the lenders under our Amended Credit Agreement, this discretion may be viewed as an additional limitation on the use of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool. 
 
 Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.

(a) Represents the following non-cash charges, gains, and other adjustments: (gains)/losses on the disposition of assets other than in the ordinary course of business, (gains)/losses on sales of certain investments, unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on commodity contracts, certain foreign currency related adjustments, and certain purchase accounting and contingent consideration adjustments. We believe that adjusting net income for these items is useful for the following reasons: 

The (gains)/losses on disposals of assets and sales of certain investments result from the sale of assets that are no longer useful in our business and therefore represent (gains)/losses that are not from our core operations. 

The adjustments for unrealized mark-to-market (gains)/losses on commodity contracts represent non-cash items to reflect changes in the fair value of forward contracts that have not been settled or terminated. We believe it is useful to adjust net income for these items because the charges do not represent a cash outlay in the period in which the charge is incurred, although Adjusted EBITDA must always be used together with our U.S. GAAP statements of comprehensive income and cash flows to capture the full effect of these contracts on our operating performance. 

Purchase accounting and contingent consideration related adjustments relate to the acquisition of businesses and the accounting related to those acquisitions. 

(b) Represents share-based compensation expense to account for stock options, restricted stock, and other stock awards over their respective vesting period. 
 
 (c) Represents transaction costs incurred directly in connection with any investment, as defined in our credit agreement, equity issuance or debt issuance or refinancing, together with certain fees relating to our senior secured credit facilities, such as administrative agent fees and credit facility commitment fees under our Amended Credit Agreement. 
 
 (d) Represents severance and other restructuring charges related to the consolidation of certain operating facilities and organizational functions. 
 
 (e) Represents the following significant and unusual charges not indicative of our ongoing operations: 
 A provision for judgments, settlements, and legal expenses related to certain patent and securities lawsuits - 2.4 million in the third quarter of 2024; 4.9 million year-to-date 2024; and 22.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Additional customer support costs related to a clean energy product customer that filed for bankruptcy in 2022 0.4 million in the first quarter of 2024. A provision for a matter with the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") concerning the imposition of civil fines for allegedly failing to timely submit a report under the Consumer Product Safety Act ("CPSA") in relation to certain portable generators that were subject to a voluntary recall previously announced 
 on July 29, 2021 - 5.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. 
 
 (f) Represents non-cash (gains)/losses from changes in the fair value of our investment in Wallbox warrants and equity securities. 
 
 (g) Represents fees paid to creditors and the write-off of the unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs in connection with the refinancing of our Tranche B Term Loan Facility.

Adjusted Net Income 
 
 To further supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide the computation of Adjusted Net Income attributable to the Company, which is defined as net income before noncontrolling interest adjusted for the following items: amortization of intangible assets, amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount related to our debt, intangible impairment charges (if any), certain transaction costs and other purchase accounting adjustments, business optimization expenses, provision for certain legal and regulatory charges, certain specific provisions, other non-cash gains and losses or charges, mark-to-market gains and losses on a minority investment, and adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, as set forth in the reconciliation table below. 
 
 We believe Adjusted Net Income is used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company s operations. Management believes the disclosure of Adjusted Net Income offers an additional financial metric that, when used in conjunction with U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of our ongoing results of operations, and the factors and trends affecting our business. 
 
 The adjustments included in the reconciliation table listed below are presented to illustrate the operating performance of our business in a manner consistent with the presentation used by investors and securities analysts. Similar to the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation, these adjustments eliminate the impact of a number of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance or cash flows, such as amortization costs, transaction costs and write-offs relating to the retirement of debt. 
 
 Similar to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income does not represent, and should not be a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations are: 

Adjusted Net Income does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

although amortization is a non-cash charge, the assets being amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted Net Income does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 

other companies may calculate Adjusted Net Income differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
