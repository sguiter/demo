Less: transaction costs and advisory fees 

Net proceeds from Pono Merger 

Pono
Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). SBC USA was determined to be the accounting acquirer and Pono was treated as the acquired company for financial
reporting purposes. Accordingly, the financial statements of the combined company represent a continuation of the financial statements
of SBC USA.

refer to 1) SBC USA and its consolidated subsidiaries and VIE prior to the consummation of Pono Merger and to 2) SBC Holding and its
consolidated subsidiaries and VIE following Pono Merger; and reference herein to Pono refers to SBC Holding prior to the
consummation of Pono Merger. 

Reorganization 

In June 2020 and April 2022, SBC
Inc., a company incorporated in Japan in June 2007, and Advice Innovation Co., Ltd., a company incorporated in Japan in December 2018,
were merged with and into SBC Medical Group Co., Ltd. SBC Japan ), respectively, with SBC Japan being the surviving entity
in such mergers. SBC Japan is a company incorporated in Japan in September 2017 and previously known as Aikawa Medical Management Co.,
Ltd. 

In April 2023, SBC Japan
acquired equity interest of L Ange Cosmetique Co., Ltd. L Ange Sub ), a company incorporated in Japan
in June 2003, and Shobikai Co., Ltd. Shobikai Sub ), a company incorporated in Japan in June 2014, through
share exchange. As a result, L Ange Sub and Shobikai Sub become wholly owned subsidiaries of SBC Japan. 

In August 2023, SBC Japan
and L Ange Sub disposed of their entire equity interest in Ai Inc. and Lange Inc., respectively, both incorporated in the Federated
States of Micronesia in January 2022, for cash. As a result, Ai Inc. and Lange Inc. cease to be subsidiaries of the Company, with
the related investment in capital being treated as a deemed distribution and the disposal proceeds treated as a deemed contribution. 

In September 2023, SBC USA
acquired equity interest of SBC Japan through share exchange with one share of its common stock. As a result, SBC Japan becomes a
wholly owned subsidiary of SBC USA. 

The above reorganization has been accounted for as
a recapitalization among entities under common control since the same controlling shareholder controlled these entities before and after
the reorganization. The consolidation of the Company has been accounted for at historical cost and prepared on the basis as if the transactions
had become effective as of the beginning of the earliest period presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

NOTE
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont.) 

The
Company would consolidate those entities in which it is determined to be the primary beneficiary. The Company based its
qualitative analysis on its review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and
the relevant development, operating management and financial agreements. 

The
Company evaluates its relationship with its VIE on an ongoing basis to determine whether it continues to be the primary beneficiary of
its consolidated VIE, or whether it has become the primary beneficiary of the VIE it does not consolidate. 

Voting
Model 

If
a legal entity fails to meet any of the three characteristics of a VIE, we then evaluate such entity under the voting model. Under the
voting model, we consolidate the entity if we determine that we, directly or indirectly, have greater than 50 of the voting rights and
that other equity holders do not have substantive participating rights. 

Assessment
of Medical Corporations in Japan 

SBC
Japan, L Ange Sub and Shobikai Sub are each designated as a medical service corporation (the MSC to provide services
to the Medical Corporations (the MCs in Japan. To maintain and strengthen the business relationship and to secure
the source of revenues from the MCs, the Company acquired equity interests in the following MCs throughout the years. 

Medical Corporation Kowakai 

Medical Corporation Nasukai 

Medical Corporation Aikeikai 

Medical Corporation Jukeikai 

Medical Corporation Ritz Cosmetic Surgery 

As
non-profit organizations, MCs are required to comply with the medical-related laws and regulations of the Japanese Medical Care Act (the
 Act , Medical Care Act ). In accordance with the Act, the highest authority of MCs is its general meeting of
members (the Members ), with each Member having one voting right. The Company, through the MSCs, has no right to elect the
Members, no decision-making ability and no right to dividend or any profit distribution, but has the right to receive distribution of
the residual assets of the MCs. 

Since
the not-for-profit entities scope exception to the variable interest model is applicable to the MCs, the Company evaluates its business
relationship, franchisor-franchisee agreements and/or services agreements with the MCs in Japan under the voting model. The Company has
concluded that consolidation of the MCs is not appropriate for the periods presented as it does not have a majority voting interest in
the Members of the MCs nor does it have a controlling financial interest in the MCs. The equity interests in the MCs held by the Company
are recorded as long-term investments in MCs related parties on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The transactions between
the Company and the MCs are disclosed in Note 17 Related Party Transactions.

Management
periodically evaluates individual End Customer s financial condition, credit history and the current economic conditions to make
adjustments in the allowance when necessary. Customer loans receivable are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection
have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company
determined no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary for customer loans receivable. 

The
Company repays each promissory note issued to the MCs when the End Customer fully repays the corresponding loan receivable or
at an earlier date agreed by the parties. The promissory notes are unsecured,
bear no interest, and are due in three months to five years, depending on the term of the loans provided to the corresponding End Customers.

Investments
in privately held companies and organizations that do not report Net Asset Value (the NAV per share 

The
Company s long-term investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV per share are accounted for using a measurement
alternative, under which these investments are measured at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments, with changes
recognized in other income (expenses). 

The
Company recognizes both realized and unrealized gain and losses in its unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income, classified with other income (expenses). Unrealized gains and losses represent observable price changes for investments
in privately held entities that do not report NAV per share. Realized gains and losses represent the difference between proceeds received
upon disposition of investments and their historical or adjusted cost. Impairments are realized losses, which result in an adjusted cost,
and represent charges to reduce the carrying values of investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV per share, if impairments
are deemed other than temporary, to their estimated fair values. 

(i)
 Long-term Investments in MCs Related Parties 

Long-term
investments in MCs related parties represent the payments to obtain equity interests of the MCs in Japan, made by the Company
through SBC Japan, a company designated as a MSC in Japan. In accordance with the Act and articles of incorporation of the MCs, which
are non-profit organizations, the equity interest holders of MCs are prohibited from receiving any profit distribution from MCs but have
the right to receive distribution of the residual assets of the MCs in proportion to the amount of their contribution. As of the balance
sheet dates, the investments represent probable future economic benefit to be realized at the time of dissolution of MCs or the equity
interests being sold. 

The
investments in MCs related parties are accounted for using a measurement alternative, under which these investments are measured
at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for observable price changes. The Company reviews the investments in MCs for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The payments made for such investments are
classified as investing activities in the unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows. The MCs are considered related parties as
the relatives of the Chief Executive Officer CEO of the Company being the Members of the MCs. Also see Note 2(a) for
further details.

NOTE
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont.) 

If
any of the above criteria is met, the Company accounts for the lease as a finance, a sales-type, or a direct financing lease. If none
of the criteria is met, the Company accounts for the lease as an operating lease. 

Lessee
accounting 

The
Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases other than those with a term of twelve months or less as
the Company has elected to apply the short-term lease recognition exemption. Right-of-use assets represent the Company s right
to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation to make lease payments arising
from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are classified and recognized at the commencement date of a lease. Lease liabilities
are measured based on the present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term. Right-of-use assets consist of (i) initial measurement
of the lease liability; (ii) lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;
and (iii) initial direct costs incurred by the Company. 

As
the rates implicit on the Company s leases for which it is the lessee are not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental
borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. When determining
the incremental borrowing rate, the Company assesses multiple variables such as lease term, collateral, economic conditions, and its
creditworthiness. 

From
time to time, we may enter into sublease agreements with third parties. Our subleases generally do not relieve us of our primary obligations
under the corresponding head lease. As a result, we account for the head lease based on the original assessment at lease inception. We
determine if the sublease arrangement is either a sales-type, direct financing, or operating lease at inception of the sublease. If the
total remaining lease cost on the head lease for the term of the sublease is greater than the anticipated sublease income, the right-of-use
asset is assessed for impairment. Our subleases are generally operating leases and we recognize sublease income on a straight-line basis
over the sublease term. 

Lessor
accounting operating leases 

The
Company accounts for the revenue from its lease contracts by utilizing the single component accounting policy. This policy requires the
Company to account for, by class of underlying asset, the lease component and nonlease component(s) associated with each lease as a single
component if two criteria are met. 

(i) 
 the
 timing and pattern of transfer of the lease component and the nonlease component(s) are the same; and 

(ii) 
 the
 lease component would be classified as an operating lease if it were accounted for separately. 

Lease
components consist primarily of fixed rental payments, which represent scheduled rental amounts due under our leases. Nonlease components
consist primarily of tenant recoveries representing reimbursements of rental operating expenses, including recoveries for utilities,
repairs and maintenance and common area expenses. 

If
the lease component is the predominant component, we account for all revenues under such lease as a single component in accordance with
the lease accounting standard. Conversely, if the nonlease component is the predominant component, all revenues under such lease are
accounted for in accordance with the revenue recognition accounting standard. Our operating leases qualify for the single component accounting,
and the lease component in each of our leases is predominant. Therefore, we account for all revenues from our operating leases under
the lease accounting standard and classify these revenues as rental income. 

The
Company commences recognition of rental income related to the operating leases at the date the property is ready for its intended use
by the tenant and the tenant takes possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. Income from rentals related to fixed
rental payments under operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective operating lease terms. Any amounts
received but will be recognized as revenue in future periods are classified in advances from customers in the Company s unaudited
consolidated balance sheets.

Lessor
accounting sales-type leases 

The
Company purchases medical equipment from vendors and leases it to its customers, who are required to pay installments throughout the
term of the leases. The lease agreements include lease payments that are fixed, do not contain residual value guarantees or variable
lease payments. The lease terms are based on the non-cancellable term of the lease and the buyer may have options to terminate the lease
in advance when meets certain conditions. The customers obtain control of the medical equipment when they physically possess the equipment. 

The
Company recognizes sales from sales-type leases equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments discounted using the implicit
interest rate in the lease and cost of sales equal to carrying amount of the asset being leased and any initial direct costs incurred,
less the present value of the unguaranteed residual. Interest income from the leases is recognized over the lease terms and included
in revenues, net. 

The
Company excludes from the measurement of its lease revenues any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is both imposed on and
concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected from a customer.

Procurement
Revenue 

The
Company generates procurement services revenue by purchasing primarily advertising services and medical materials from qualified vendors
on behalf of MCs to maintain brand quality consistency. Procurement services revenue is recognized at the point in time upon the delivery
of products or over time as services are performed. Occasionally, the Company receives vendor discounts on certain large purchases. It
recognizes revenue based on actual payments and will return the over-collection resulting from such discounts to MCs. 

Management
Services Revenue 

The
Company provides loyalty program management services, labor supporting services, function supporting services, and management consulting
services to MCs. 

Loyalty
program management services 

The
Company awards loyalty points on behalf of MCs to MCs customers, who earn loyalty points from each qualified purchase made at
the loyalty program participating clinics of MCs, in exchange for a handling fee. The revenue is based on a percentage of the related
payment amount made by MCs customers and is recognized when the loyalty points are awarded. 

At
the time loyalty points are awarded, a MC pays the Company cash in an amount equivalent to the awarded loyalty points, which is recorded
as advances from customers. When a MC s customers redeem the loyalty points, the Company returns the cash back to the MC in an
amount equivalent to the redeemed loyalty points. The awarded loyalty points expire if a MC s customer does not make any additional
qualified purchase at a participating clinic within a year. The Company accumulates and tracks the points on behalf of MCs until the
loyalty points expire at which time the Company recognizes an amount equivalent to the expired loyalty points as revenue, which is normally
not significant. 

The
Company also awards certain points to MCs customers on behalf of MCs for free in order to increase the volume of MC s sales,
from which the Company earns other types of revenues, such as royalty income. When a MC s customers redeem such points, the Company
reimburses MC in an amount equivalent to the used free points and records it as a reduction of the revenue recognized. 

The
Company is an agent in the management of loyalty programs, and as a result, revenues are recognized net of the cost of redemptions. 

Labor
supporting services 

The
Company generates revenue by dispatching staff to MCs to provide a range of services, primarily including clinic operation, IT, and administrative
services. The Company recognizes the revenue over the time when services are rendered. 

Function
supporting services 

The
revenue is derived from providing functional supporting services to MCs, such as accounting and human resources services. The Company
recognizes the revenue over the time when services are rendered. 

Management
consulting services 

The
Company generates revenue by providing consulting services to MCs in relation to business operations of cosmetic dermatology. The Company
recognizes the revenue over the time when services are rendered.

Japanese
Yen JPY against the U.S. dollar slightly depreciated for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the
three months September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated net revenues of 53,084,883
(JPY7,908 million) and 47,278,685 (JPY6,718 million), respectively, we reported net income of 2,834,467 (JPY389 million) and
 8,057,791 (JPY1,149 million), respectively. Overall, the unfavorable impacts of the period-to-period foreign exchange rate changes
on net revenues was 2,570,776 and favorable impact on net income was 108,549, for the three months ended September 30,
2024. 

The
main reasons for the variance of 5,806,198 in revenues, net per revenue stream are as follows: 

Royalty
income 

Royalty
income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 15,688,528 by 7,081,529, or 82.28 , from 8,606,999 for the same
period in 2023. This increase was mainly due to authorizing the six MCs, which are our main recurring customers, to use our patents and
trademarks starting from September 2023, as well as the business expansion of the MCs. 

Procurement
services 

The
procurement services revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 17,571,299 by 8,611,610, or 96.12 , from 8,959,689
for the same period in 2023. This increase was mainly due to the increased demand on advertising services and medical materials due to
the business expansion of MCs. 

Management
services 

The management services revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 12,110,764 by 10,858,423, or 47.27 , from 22,969,187 for the same period
in 2023. This decrease was mainly due to the revenue generated by dispatching staff to MCs to provide clinic operation services were discontinued
since September 2024, because the Company plans to merge Shobikai Sub to another subsidiary and the related license, held by Shobikai
Sub, to conduct such staff dispatching business will be invalid after the merger. 

Rental
services 

The
rental services revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 4.124,774 by 2,786,971, or 208.32 , from 1,337,803
for the same period. This increase was mainly due to the increased demand for medical equipment from MCs due to the business expansion
of MCs. 

 Others 

The
other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 3,589,518 by 1,815,489, or 33.59 , from 5,405,007 for the
same period in 2023. This decrease was mainly due to the decrease in demand for leasehold improvement services . 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 9,845,793 compared to 13,780,309 for the same period in 2023. The
decrease was mainly due to the discontinuation of clinic operation staff supporting services provide by Shobikai Sub to MCs since
September 2024, and the Company then terminated the employment of the related staff. As a result, labor cost significantly decreased. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 43,239,090 compared to 33,498,376 for the same period in 2023. The increase
in gross profit by 9,740,714 or 29.08 was mainly due to the increase in royalty income and procurement services with a relatively high
gross margin as a result of the factors described above, offset by the decrease in management services revenue as a result of the factors
described above.

The
operating expenses increased to 29,404,487 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 by 15,929,353, or 118.21 , from 13,475,134
for the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to the increase in stock-based compensation, the increase in consulting and
professional service fees and the increase in office, utility and other expenses, partially offset by the decrease in depreciation and
amortization expenses. 

Stock-based compensation relate to the warrants issued
to the service provider that supported SBC s listing process. These warrants were issued in November 2022 and became exercisable upon
the consummation of business combination with Pono Two Capital, Inc., and the fair value was recognized as an expense. 

Consulting
and professional service fees increased by 4,157,001, or 455.20 , to 5,070,231 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 913,230
for the same period in 2023, mainly due to the increase of the professional service fees incurred related to the business combination
transaction. 

Office,
utility and other expenses increased by 1,175,844, or 94.40 , to 2,421,455 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,245,611
for the same period in 2023, mainly due to the insurance expense recognized due to the decrease in the cash surrender
values of the corporate-owned life insurance policies and administrative expenses increased in preparation for the listing. 

Depreciation
and amortization expense decreased by 2,204,482, or 76.30 , to 684,926 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from
 2,889,408 for the same period in 2023, mainly because the decrease in amortization expense incurred from the intangible assets
owned by Cell Pro Japan Co., Ltd.( Cellpro ), a former subsidiary of the Company, due to the disposal of Cellpro on
January 1, 2024. 

Other
Income (Expenses)

 795,158 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 98,314 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly
due to the increase in unrealized loss from the Company s investment in a public entity with readily determinable fair
value.

Income
Tax Expense 

Income
tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 10,273,384 compared to 13,012,262 for the same period in 2023. The decrease
in income tax expense by 2,738,878 or 21.05 was mainly due to the impact of a temporary increase in listing-related expenses recorded
in conjunction with the listing. The decrease was in line with the decrease in income before tax generated by the major operating entities
in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with September 30, 2023. 

The
effective tax rate was 78.38 and 61.76 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 16.62
percentage points was mainly due to the recognition of stock-based compensation of 12,807,455 in the three months ended September 30,
2024 while no such expense was recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
Income 

As
a result of the foregoing, we reported a net income of 2,834,467 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease
of 5,223,324 or 64.82 from 8,057,791 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-controlling Interests

attributable to non-controlling interests of 298,623 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to the disposal of Cellpro
on January 1, 2024.

ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated net revenues of 160,995,005 (JPY24,331 million)
and 131,192,729 (JPY18,118 million), respectively, we reported net income of 40,142,008 (JPY6,067 million) and 24,330,964 (JPY3,360
million), respectively. Overall, the unfavorable impacts of the period-to-period foreign exchange rate changes on net revenues and net
income were 15,184,893 and 3,786,155, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The
main reasons for the variance of 29,802,276 in revenues, net per revenue stream are as follows: 

Royalty
income 

The
royalty income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 45,425,052 by 19,979,012, or 78.52 , from 25,446,040 for
the same period in 2023. This increase was mainly due to (i) a change in the billing base of royalty fees from a percentage of sales
of MCs to a fixed amount for each clinic of MCs since April 2023 combined with an increase in the number of clinics operated by MCs,
(ii) authorizing the six MCs, which are our main recurring customers, to use our patents and trademarks starting from September 2023,
and (iii) the business expansion of the MCs, partially offset by the depreciation of JPY. 

Procurement
services 

The
procurement services revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 44,303,891 by 9,640,957, 27.81 , from 34,662,934
for the same period in 2023. This increase was mainly due to the increase in the demand on medical materials due to the business expansion
of MCs, partially offset by the depreciation of JPY. 

Management
services 

The
management services revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 44,471,031 by 9,222,917, or 17.18 , from 53,693,948
for the same period in 2023. This decrease was mainly due to (i) the discontinuation of clinic operation staff supporting services provided by Shobikai Sub to MCs since
September 2024 and (ii) the depreciation of JPY, partially offset by (i) the increase in revenue generated from management consulting services
and loyalty program management services provided to two MCs that the Company started to conduct business since September 2023 (Medical
Corporation Association Furinkai and Medical Corporation Association Junikai), (ii) the business expansion of MCs and (iii) the increase
in the number of the clinics of MCs. 

Rental
services 

The
rental services revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 11,195,888 by 6,514,675, or 139.17 , from 4,681,213
for the same period in 2023. This increase was mainly due to the increased demand for medical equipment from MCs due to the business
expansion of MCs, partially offset by the depreciation of JPY. 

6 

Others 

The
other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 15,599,143 by 2,890,549, or 22.74 , from 12,708,594 for the
same period in 2023. This increase was mainly due to the business expansion of the subsidiary acquired in 2023, partially offset by the
depreciation of JPY. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 38,816,865 compared to 37,256,066 for the same period in 2023. Even though
revenue increased by 29,802,276, or 22.72 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to same period in 2023, cost of revenues
only increase by 1,560,799 or 4.19 mainly due to the Company s effort of the cost reduction for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, as well as the revenue generated by providing clinic operation supporting
services by Shobikai Sub to MCs were discontinued since September 2024, and the Company then terminated the employment of the related
staff. As a result, labor cost significantly decreased. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 122,178,140 compared to 93,936,663 for the same period in 2023. The increase
in gross profit by 28,241,477 or 30.06 was mainly due to the increase in royalty income and procurement services with a relatively
high gross margin as a result of the factors described above, offset by the decrease in management services revenue as a result of the
factors described above. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to the increase in stock-based compensation and the increase in consulting and professional
service fees, partially offset by the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses. 

Stock-based
compensation related to the warrants issued to the service provider that supported our listing process. These warrants were issued in
November 2022 and became exercisable upon the consummation of business combination with Pono Two Capital, Inc., and the fair value is recognized
as an expense. 

Consulting
and professional service fees increased by 4,378,501, or 74.20 , to 10,279,107 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5,900,606
for the same period in 2023, mainly due to the increase of the professional service fees incurred related to the business combination
transaction. 

Depreciation
and amortization expense decreased by 6,751,582, or 77.93 , to 1,912,284 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 8,663,866
for the same period in 2023, mainly because the decrease in amortization expense incurred from the intangible assets owned by Cellpro,
a former subsidiary of the Company, due to the disposal of Cellpro on January 1, 2024.

Income
Tax Expense 

Income
tax expense, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 27,254,478 compared to 25,683,244 for the same period in 2023. The increase
in income tax expense by 1,571,234 or 6.12 was mainly due to an increase in income before tax of the major operating entities as a
result of an increase in related-party revenues compared to the same period in 2023. 

The
effective tax rate was 40.44 and 51.35 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 10.91 percentage
points was mainly due to the 8.7 million enterprise tax paid by the Company in the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, which is tax deductible, while only 3 million enterprise tax was paid in the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Net
Income 

As
a result of the foregoing, we reported a net income of 40,142,008 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase
of 15,811,044, or 64.98 , from 24,330,964 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

attributable to non-controlling interests of 696,812 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to the disposal of Cellpro
on January 1, 2024. 

Liquidity
and Sources of Funds 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had 137,393,070 in cash and cash equivalents compared to 103,022,932 as of December 31, 2023. In
addition, the Company had 29,779,783 in accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024 compared to 35,113,749 as of December 31, 2023.
The Company s accounts receivable includes balances due from customers for the services and goods provided by the Company and accepted
by customers. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company s working capital balance was 129,679,294. In assessing liquidity, management monitors and
analyzes the Company s cash and cash equivalents, ability to generate sufficient future earnings, and operating and capital
investment commitments. The Company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents from operations and borrowings from banks
will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of the unaudited financial
statements included in this Quarterly Report. 

To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our
business strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through the incurrence of indebtedness, equity financings or a combination
of these potential sources of funds. While we face uncertainties regarding the size and timing of our fundraising, which will be affected
by general economic, financial, and other factors that may be beyond our control, we believe
that we will be able to continue to meet our current business needs through the use of cash flows generated from operations and stockholder
working capital, as needed. 

The Company evaluates its capital allocation practices
with the objective of enhancing shareholder value, while considering performance, the business environment, macroeconomic conditions and
other relevant factors. The Company expects to deploy capital for investment opportunities that align with its growth strategy, selectively
pursuing prospects in the expanding global medical aesthetics market.

Misappropriations
of Funds and Restatements 

In
January 2024, in connection with a routine tax examination of the Company s income tax returns, the Japanese tax authority discovered
misappropriations of Company funds by a former director of general affairs and legal department of L Ange Cosmetique Co., Ltd.,
which is a subsidiary of the Company (the former director ), not a relative of the CEO of the Company or any identified
related party, who received kickbacks from multiple vendors of SBC Japan (collectively with the former director, the participants possibly beginning as early as 2012 until the misappropriations were discovered. The former director was suspended immediately upon the
discovery and was terminated effective February 23, 2024. The Company has commenced a criminal complaint in Tokyo against the participants. 

Shortly
after this discovery, the Company engaged independent legal counsel and forensic consultants to investigate the misappropriations. The
investigation, which was completed in March 2024, revealed that the participants had misappropriated approximately JPY632 million 5.6
million), including consumption tax, from the Company of which the former director received approximately JPY335 million 3.0 million),
between April 2016 and the discovery of the misappropriations in January 2024. The amount misappropriated prior to April 2016 could not
be accurately determined because certain data for the period prior to April 2016 was unavailable, the Company does not expect such amount
to be material based on current estimates. 

The
Company found no evidence that any other employee of the Company was aware of, or colluded in, the misappropriations of Company funds
or that there was any unlawful activity apart from that associated with the participants misappropriations of Company funds. The
misappropriated amounts, excluding the consumption tax, representing advertising services purchased on behalf of a related-party MC,
were originally included in the revenues reported on a net basis. After discovery of the misappropriations, the amounts were restated
as a misappropriation loss. 

The
Company has restated its previously reported consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for the years then ended, based on the results of its investigation
and substantive validation procedures. The Company has also restated its previously reported unaudited consolidated balance sheets for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related unaudited consolidated

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements (Off-Balance Sheet Transactions) 

There
are no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Foreign
Exchange Rate Risk 

We
are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because our business is primarily conducted in Japan and most of our revenues
and costs are denominated in Japanese yen, whereas our reporting currency is U.S. dollar. The weakening of the Japanese yen against the
U.S. dollar would have a negative impact on our financial results and vice versa. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We
prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions.
We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experiences
and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component
of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from our expectations as a result of changes in our estimates. Some of
our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application and require us to make significant accounting
estimates. We believe that critical accounting policies as disclosed in this Quarterly Report reflect the more significant judgements
and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

The
following descriptions of critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
and other disclosures included in this Quarterly Report. When reviewing our consolidated financial statements, you should consider our
selection of critical accounting policies, the judgments and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and the sensitivity
of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue from franchising services, procurement services, management services and other services under ASC Topic 606,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . 

To
determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s)
with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable
consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price
to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance
obligation. Revenue amount represents the invoiced value, net of consumption tax and applicable local government levies, if any. The
consumption tax on sales is calculated at 10 of gross sales. The Company does not have significant remaining unfulfilled performance
obligations or contract balances. 

The
Company reports revenue on a gross or net basis based on management s assessment of whether the Company acts as a principal or
agent in the transaction. The determination of whether the Company acts as a principal or an agent in a transaction is based on the evaluation
of whether (i) the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or service, (ii) the Company
has inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to a customer or after transfer of control to the customer
and (iii) the Company has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. If the terms of a transaction do not
indicate the Company is acting as a principal in the transaction, then the Company is acting as an agent in the transaction and the associated
revenues are recognized on a net basis. 

The
Company recognizes revenue from rental services under ASC Topic 842, Leases . 

The
Company currently generates its revenue from the following main sources: 

11 

Franchising
Revenue 

The
Company generates franchising revenue (royalty income) by licensing its intellectual properties, including but not limited to the Company s
brand name Shonan Beauty Clinic ), trade name, patents, and trademarks, as a franchisor pursuant to franchise agreements
with certain MCs (the MCs in Japan. Prior to April 2023, royalty income is based on a percentage of sales and recognized
at the time when the related sales occurred; since April 2023, it is based on a fixed amount to each clinic of the MCs; since September
2023, it is based on a fixed amount to each MC and a fixed amount to each clinic of the MCs and recognized over time as services are
rendered. 

Procurement
Services Revenue 

The
Company generates procurement services revenue by purchasing primarily advertising services and medical materials from qualified vendors
on behalf of MCs to maintain brand quality consistency. Procurement services revenue is recognized at the point in time upon the delivery
of products or over time as services are performed. Occasionally, the Company receives vendor discounts on certain large purchases. It
recognizes revenue based on actual payments and will return the over-collection resulting from such discounts to MCs. 

Management
Services Revenue 

The
Company provides loyalty program management services, labor supporting services, function supporting services and management consulting
services to MCs. 

Loyalty
program management services 

The
Company awards loyalty points on behalf of MCs to MCs customers, who earn loyalty points from each qualified purchase made at
the loyalty program participating clinics of MCs, in exchange for a handling fee. The revenue is based on a percentage of the related
payment amount made by MCs customers and is recognized when the loyalty points are awarded. 

At
the time loyalty points are awarded, a MC pays the Company cash in an amount equivalent to the awarded loyalty points, which is recorded
as advances from customers. When a MC s customers redeem the loyalty points, the Company returns the cash back to the MC in an
amount equivalent to the redeemed loyalty points. The awarded loyalty points expire if a MC s customer does not make any additional
qualified purchase at a participating clinic within a year. The Company accumulates and tracks the points on behalf of MCs until the
loyalty points expire, at which time the Company recognizes an amount equivalent to the expired loyalty points as revenue, which is normally
not significant. 

The
Company also awards certain points to MCs customers on behalf of MCs for free in order to increase the volume of MC s sales,
from which the Company earns other types of revenues, such as royalty income. When a MC s customers redeem such points, the Company
reimburses MC in an amount equivalent to the used free points and records it as a reduction of the revenue recognized. 

The
Company is an agent in the management of loyalty programs, and as a result, revenues are recognized net of the cost of redemptions. 

Labor supporting services 

The
Company generates revenue by dispatching staff to MCs to provide a range of services, primarily including clinic operation, IT, and administrative
services. The Company recognizes the revenue over the time when services are rendered. 

Function
supporting services 

The
revenue is derived from providing functional supporting services to MCs, such as accounting and human resources services. The Company
recognizes the revenue over the time when services are rendered. 

Management
consulting services

Long-term
Investments in MCs Related Parties 

Long-term
investments in MCs related parties represent the payments to obtain equity interests of the MCs in Japan, made by the Company
through SBC Japan, a company designated as a MSC in Japan. In accordance with the Japanese Medical Care Act and articles of incorporation
of the MCs, which are non-profit organizations, the equity interest holders of MCs are prohibited from receiving any profit distribution
from MCs but have the right to receive distribution of the residual assets of the MCs in proportion to the amount of their contribution.
As of the balance sheet dates, the investments represent probable future benefit to be realized at the time of dissolution of MCs or
the equity interests being sold. The payments made for such investments are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements
of cash flows. The MCs are considered related parties as the relatives of the Chief Executive Officer CEO of the Company
being the Members of the MCs. 

The
investments in MCs related parties are accounted for using a measurement alternative, under which the investments are measured
at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for observable price changes. The Company reviews the investments in MCs for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, especially the investments in Medical Corporation
Jukeikai MC Jukeikai and Medical Corporation Ritz Cosmetic Surgery MC Ritz ), which represent the vast
majority of the Company s investments in MCs balance. 

Impairment
Consideration of Investments in MC Jukeikai and MC Ritz 

Although
these two MCs are non-profit entities, their principal operations are providing health care services and they derive primary source of
their revenue from the sale of goods and services, rather than the fund contributions. 

No
indicator of impairment was noticed based on the Company s qualitative assessment of impairment. As the Company provides comprehensive
management services to these two MCs, including accounting and bookkeeping services, the Company has access to MCs unaudited financial
information. In addition to the external market conditions and trends within the MCs industry, the Company considered the MCs 
operating performance, such as sales, increase in sales, and net income (loss) when performing its qualitative assessment. As of December
31, 2023, the carrying value of the investments in the two MCs was higher than their net assets, respectively, because the Company acquired
the equity interests with the considerations paid higher than the net asset values at the respective purchase dates due to the expected
growth and expansion of the MCs. The two MCs have been generating net income since the acquisition dates through the year ended December
31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, as part of their plan of expansion, the MCs opened several new clinics and incurred
one-time expenses to set up those clinics and more selling, general, and administrative expenses, such as payroll, rent, and advertising
expenses. The net losses incurred by the two MCs for the year ended December 31, 2023 associated with the opening of new clinics are
considered temporary. The Company expects that the MCs sales will grow gradually over the next few years and that the MCs will
be able to generate net income in the next one to two years. As of December 31, 2023, the Company did not observe any other-than-temporary
impairment indicators. 

For
management s additional internal analysis purposes, the Company estimates the residual values of the two MCs at dissolution when
needed, using the income approach with the discounted cash flow method, which estimates the fair values of the MCs by the present worth
of the net economic benefit to be received by MCs. Management applies significant judgment and assumptions related to estimation, including
but not limited to the forecasted revenues, the selection of an expected EBITDA margin assumption for the forecast period, forecasted
future cash flows, and the discounted rate. The Company currently expects the residual values at the dissolution of the MCs will not
be less than the carrying values of the investments in MCs. The management is not aware of any legal or regulatory limitations on the
Company s ability to realize the full amount of proceeds generated from a liquidation of the MCs. 

Stock-based Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ,
under which the Company determines whether stock-based compensation awards should be classified and accounted for as an equity award.
There were no liability awards granted during any of the periods stated herein. For all grants of stock-based compensation classified
as equity awards, the cost of services received from employees and non-employees in exchange for awards is recognized in the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income based on the estimated fair value of those awards on the grant date and amortized on
a straight-line basis over the requisite service period or vesting period. The Company records forfeitures and cancellations as they
occur. 

The
Company, with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist, determined the fair value of the warrants recognized in the consolidated
financial statements using the binomial option pricing model, and the equity value as of the grant date was estimated using 1) income
approach with the discounted cash flow valuation method, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related
to forecasted revenues and cash flows and the discount rates, and 2) market approach with metrics of publicly traded companies or historically
completed transactions of comparable businesses. The Company applied a weighting to the income approach and market approach to determine
the fair value. We believe the accounting estimate for valuation of stock-based compensation is a critical accounting estimate
because our estimates of fair value of stock-based compensation are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently
uncertain and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. 

Emerging
Growth Company 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we will
take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements,
and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any
golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do
not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended
transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private
companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised
standard. 

Smaller
Reporting Company 

Additionally,
we are a smaller reporting company, as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take
advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements.
We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (i) the market value of our common stock held
by non-affiliates exceeds 250 million as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or (ii) our annual revenue exceeded
 100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as
of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. If we continue to be a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an
emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from these certain reduced disclosure requirements that are available
to smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the
information otherwise required under this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as
of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in periodic SEC filings is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Specifically, as previously disclosed, as of the fiscal year ended December 31,
2023, and as described below, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 

Despite
the identified material weaknesses, we believe that our condensed consolidated financial statements and other information contained in
this Quarterly Report fairly present, in all material respects, our business, financial condition, and results of operations for the
periods presented. 

We
remain committed to ongoing improvements in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, as outlined in the
remediation plan below. 

13 

Material
Weakness 

A
material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. 

In
connection with the discovery of the misappropriations of funds as described in more details under Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Misappropriations of Funds and Restatements , we
have identified material weaknesses as of December 31, 2023, which remain un-remediated as of September 30, 2024, in our internal control
over financial reporting resulting from our failure to maintain an effective control environment, risk assessment processes and monitoring
activities. 

Our
system of internal control failed to detect the misappropriations of funds due to the following material weaknesses of SBC Medical Group,
Inc. (formerly known as SBC Medical Group Holdings Incorporated), a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of the Company: 

1. 
 Control
 Environment . We did not maintain an effective control environment that fully emphasized the establishment of adherence to
 effective internal control over financial reporting throughout SBC Medical Group, Inc. s management. We did not give sufficient
 consideration to the risk of senior management override of internal control. SBC Medical Group, Inc. had not ensured that certain
 personnel were adequately trained to properly execute critical internal control. 

2. 
 Control
 Activities . We did not effectively implement or maintain control activities, such as ensuring a sufficient functioning of
 the mechanism of reconciliation of invoices to contracts and multi-level approvals of contracts, invoices and payments. SBC Medical
 Group, Inc. did not maintain sufficient segregation of duties with respect to certain activities of its former director of the general
 affairs and legal department at L Ange Cosmetique Co., Ltd. SBC Medical Group, Inc. did not maintain adequate monitoring and
 oversight of the activities of our former director permitting the misappropriation of assets by the former director. 

3. 
 Risk
 Assessment . We did not have an effective risk assessment process and the related documentation. 

4. 
 Information
 and Communication . We did not adequately communicate to all employees of the organization information regarding the importance
 of internal control over financial reporting and employees duties and responsibilities, including segregation of duties. 

5. 
 Monitoring
 Activities . We did not maintain effective monitoring controls related to the evaluation and testing of our internal control
 over financial reporting. 

In
addition, the Company completed its business combination in September 2024. Prior to the business combination, the Company operated as
a private corporation with limited accounting personnel and supervisory resources necessary to support its accounting processes
and address its internal control over financial reporting requirements. As a result, the existing internal control are no longer sufficient
to meet the post-business combination financial reporting demands, and the Company is actively updating these controls. The design and
implementation of internal control over financial reporting in a post-business combination environment has required, and will continue
to require, significant time and resources from management and other personnel. 

During
the process of assessing the Company s internal control, management identified the following additional material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: 

Lack of well-established procedures to identify, approve and report related party transactions. 

Lack
 of sufficient financial reporting and accounting personnel to formalize, design, implement
 and operate key controls over financial reporting process in order to report financial information
 in accordance with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. 

Lack
 of well-established procedures to ensure all the services provided by subcontractors or vendors
 are reviewed and verified before the approval of payments. 

Lack of well-established
 procedures to prevent and detect fraudulent transactions or override of control activities, specifically
 failure to maintain sufficient segregation of duties with respect to certain activities of its former director
 of general affairs and legal department of one of its subsidiaries and failure to maintain adequate monitoring
 and oversight of the work performed by this former director. 

Remediation
Plan 

With
 respect to the material weaknesses identified in connection with the misappropriations of
 funds, management has implemented, or is in the process of implementing, the following changes
 to SBC Medical Group, Inc. s internal control systems and procedures: 

We established a related party policy in September 2024 to identify, approve, and report related party transactions; and implemented the corresponding procedures since November 2024. 

We
 will clarify the organization structure and employee positions promoting (i) segregation of duties, (ii) monitoring and oversight,
 (iii) reconciliation of invoices to contracts and (iv) multi-level approvals of contracts, invoices and payments. 

We
 will communicate to all employees of the organization information regarding the importance of internal control and employees 
 duties and responsibilities, including segregation of duties. 

14 

We
 have initiated a project led by our Chief Officer of Internal Control and Internal Audit Office, and aided by outside consultants,
 to fully document our processes to serve as the basis for activities during 2024 to assess our fraud risks and evaluate and test our
 internal control over financial reporting. 

We
 have updated our delegation of authority over our banking activities, and are establishing a treasury function that will improve
 the segregation of duties surrounding the general manager role to better safeguard cash. 

Furthermore,
management is fully committed to addressing the control deficiencies that contributed to the material weaknesses in a post-business combination
environment. The steps we have already taken in 2024, and those we plan to take in 2025, are as follows: 

We
 added accounting and finance personnel to strengthen our team. This has allowed us to enhance segregation of duties in the preparation
 and review of financial reporting, while improving oversight, structure, and reporting lines. 

We
 have improved our controls related to the preparation and review of complex accounting measurements, the application of GAAP, and
 our financial statement disclosures. We believe that this will ensure more accurate and timely reporting. 

We
 have engaged external consultants with expertise in SOX (The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) compliance to assist us in the design,
 implementation, and documentation of internal control that address key financial reporting risks. These consultants will also help
 ensure appropriate evidence of the performance of our controls, including the accuracy and completeness of financial
 data. 

As applicable to each material weakness, the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until our remediation
plans have been fully implemented, the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and we have concluded, through testing,
that the newly implemented and enhanced controls are operating effectively. Under
the direction of our Audit Committee, management will continue to enhance corporate oversight at the process level, ensuring proper assignment
of authority, responsibility, and accountability. We anticipate completing the implementation of key control enhancements by the end
of 2025, which we expect to further strengthen our financial reporting oversight. Furthermore, we believe these efforts will remediate
the identified material weakness and substantially improve our internal control over financial reporting. 

We
have continued the process of, and are focused on, further enhancing effective internal control measures to improve our internal
control over financial reporting and to remediate the identified material weakness. We are committed to the continuous improvement
of our internal control over financial reporting and will continue to diligently review our internal control over financial
reporting. As we continue to evaluate and refine our internal control over financial reporting, we may adjust our remediation plans
or take additional steps to address control deficiencies as necessary. 

Inherent
Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Control 

The
effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting is subject to inherent limitations. These include the exercise
of judgment in designing, implementing, and operating controls, as well as the inherent inability to completely eliminate the risk of
misconduct or error. Accordingly, while we aim to establish robust controls, any system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 

Additionally,
the design of our disclosure controls and procedures is impacted by resource constraints and the necessity for management to balance
the benefits of potential controls against their associated costs. Moreover, projections of effectiveness into future periods are
subject to risks that controls may become inadequate over time due to evolving conditions or diminished compliance. We will continue
to monitor and enhance our internal control as necessary or appropriate, but we cannot provide assurance that these improvements
will fully eliminate all risks of material misstatement. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than the remediation efforts described above, there have been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
