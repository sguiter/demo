The Company s primary source of liquidity has historically been cash generated from equity and debt offerings along with cash flows from revenue. Under ASC Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern ASC 205-40 ), the Company has the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about its ability to meet future financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date that these financial statements are issued.

Future cash requirements for our current liabilities include for accounts payable and accrued expenses, for secured promissory notes (see Note 9 Notes Payable), for future payments under financing and operating leases and for unsecured promissory notes.

On February 12, 2024, the Company received a second notice letter from NYSE stating it is not in compliance with Section 1003 (f)(v) of the Company guide since the Company s securities were trading at an average of less than per share for 30 days.

On May 1, 2024, the Company received a notification from the NYSE stating that the Company had regained compliance with Section 1003 (f)(v) of the Company Guide, given the increase in the trading price of the Company s securities. The factors above raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to meet its obligations as they become due within the twelve months from the date these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. Management s plans to mitigate the factors which raise substantial doubt include (i) revenue growth, (ii) reducing operating expenses through careful cost management, and (iii) raising additional funds through future financings.

See Note 10 Stockholders Equity (Deficit) At the Market Offering for additional information. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully execute the aforementioned initiatives. There is no assurance that the amount of funds the Company might raise will enable the Company to complete its development initiatives or attain profitable operations. The aforementioned factors indicate that management s plans do not alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

License and Opportunities for KULR VIBE Fan Balancing Applications On September 29, 2024, we entered into a licensing agreement for our proprietary vibration reduction technology named KULR Xero Vibe KXV ). The 2.35M landmark deal includes a 1.1M minimum guaranteed license and royalty fee, a unique opportunity for the licensee to purchase proprietary balancing equipment directly from the Company and additional revenue upside to the Company based on volume and technology upgrades. The licensee, a leading Japanese corporation, specializing in systems integration and the distribution of advanced semiconductor solutions, intends to use the KXV technology to balance industrial-scale fan systems used in data center computer cooling, HVAC and other industrial applications. The Company is exploring additional license opportunities based on geographic regions in tangential power-consuming applications, where the Company expects substantial upside revenue potential as product sales and royalty income scales along with its customers growth. Change in Address of Principal Executive Offices In the third quarter of 2024, we moved our principal executive offices to 555 Forge River Road, Suite 100, Webster, Texas 77598. Risks Associated with Ongoing Conflicts The short and long-term worldwide implications of Russia s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time. The imposition of sanctions on Russia by the United States or other countries and possible counter sanctions by Russia, and the resulting economic impacts on oil prices and other materials and goods, could affect the price of materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates. If the price of materials used in the manufacturing of our product candidates increase, that would adversely affect our business and the results of our operations. Additionally, we do not have operations or material net sales in Israel or Gaza and we currently do not expect the recent hostilities in that region to have a material impact on our business. We cannot predict how the events described above will evolve. If the events continue for a significant period of time or expand to other countries, and depending on the ultimate outcomes of these conflicts, which remain uncertain, they could heighten certain risks disclosed in Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K which was filed with the SEC on April 12, 2024, including, but not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including increased inflation, constraints on the availability of commodities, supply chain disruption and decreased business spending; cyber-incidents; disruptions to our or our business partners global technology infrastructure, including through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; claims, litigation and regulatory enforcement; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy; terrorist activities; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; reputational risk; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Compliance with NYSE American Continued Listing Requirements On December 20, 2023, the Company received a notice of noncompliance (the Stockholders Equity Notice from NYSE Regulation NYSE stating that it is not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) in the NYSE American Company Guide (the Company Guide since the Company reported stockholders equity of 1,200,172 on September 30, 2023, and losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years. Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide requires a listed company to have stockholders

 equity of 6 million or more if the listed company has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years. As required by the Stockholders Equity Notice, on January 19, 2024, the Company submitted a plan (the Plan to NYSE advising of actions it has taken or will take to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by June 20, 2025. NYSE staff will review the Company periodically for compliance with the initiatives outlined in the Plan. If the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards by June 20, 2025, or if the Company does not make progress consistent with the Plan during the Plan period, NYSE staff will initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate. On March 5, 2024, the Company received a notification from the NYSE that the Company s plan to regain compliance with Section 1003 (a)(iii) of the Company Guide was accepted and so long as the Company meets its interim objectives, the Company will have until June 20, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement. Results of Operations Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared With Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenue Our revenues consisted of the following contract types: 

For the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Product sales 765,201 1,896,470 2,515,063 5,483,098 Contract services 1,391,810 1,144,537 3,823,057 2,013,217 IP license 1,028,767 1,028,767 Total Revenue 3,185,778 3,041,007 7,366,887 7,496,315 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated 3,185,778 and 3,041,007 of revenues from 33 and 18 customers, respectively, representing an increase of 144,771, or 5 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated 7,366,887 and 7,496,315 of revenues from 62 and 37 customers, respectively, representing a decrease of 129,428, or 2 . Revenue from product sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 1,131,269 or 60 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Product sales include the sales of our component product, internal short circuit ISC battery cells and devices, and safe cases. We had 20 product sales customers in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 13 in the third quarter of 2023. The decline in product revenue can be attributed to several expected third quarter 2024 orders, which management now expects to receive in a later period. We can provide no assurance as to when we will receive the expected orders. Revenue from product sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 2,968,035 or 54 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We had 47 product sales customers in the nine months of 2024, compared with 29 in the nine months of 2023. The decline in product revenue can be attributed to several expected third quarter 2024 orders, which management now expects to receive in a later period. We can provide no assurance as to when we will receive the expected orders. Revenue from contract services during the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 247,273 or 22 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Service revenues include certain research and development contracts and onsite engineering services. We had 17 contract services customers in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 7 in the third quarter of 2023. Contract services customers increased in both design and testing services for new and existing customers.

 Revenue from IP license agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 1,028,767. License revenue consists of a contract with a customer for the right to use our patented KULR VIBE technology. This contract was executed during the three months ended September 30, 2024. There was no license revenue recognized prior to this period. Our customers and prospective customers are large organizations with multiple levels of management, controls/procedures, and contract evaluation/authorization. Furthermore, our solutions are new and do not necessarily fit into pre-existing patterns of purchase commitments. Accordingly, the business activity cycle between expression of initial customer interest to shipping, acceptance and billing can be lengthy, unpredictable, and lumpy, which can influence the timing, consistency and reporting of sales growth. Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin Cost of revenue consisted of the cost of our products as well as labor and production overhead expenses directly related to product sales or research contract services. Product mix plays an important part in our reported average margins for any period. Because we are introducing new products at an early stage in our development cycle, the margins earned can vary significantly between periods, customers, products and services due to the learning process, customer negotiating strengths, and product mix, among other factors. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenues was 928,326 and 1,703,553, respectively, representing a decrease of 775,227 or 46 . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, gross profit was 2,257,452 and 1,337,454, respectively, an increase of 919,998 or 69 . Our gross profit margins were 71 and 44 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the current period profit margin resulted primarily from an IP licensing agreement that generated 1,028,767 of revenue which had no corresponding cost of revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenues was 4,026,018 and 4,513,285, respectively, representing an decrease of 487,267 or 11 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, gross profit was 3,340,869 and 2,983,030, respectively, an increase of 357,839 or 12 . Our gross profit margins were 45 and 40 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in the current period profit margin resulted primarily from an IP licensing agreement that generated 1,028,767 of revenue which had no corresponding cost of revenue. Research and Development Research and development R D includes expenses incurred in connection with the R D of our CFV thermal management solution, high-areal-capacity battery electrodes, and 3D engineering for a rechargeable battery. Research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, R D expenses were 1,232,333 and 1,821,658, respectively, representing a decrease of 589,325 or 32 . The decrease was comprised primarily of 538,784 of labor costs allocated to cost of revenue due to the increase in service revenue, 180,075 related to a planned decrease in R D consulting services to conserve cash and a 69,267 decrease in stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in building related expenses of approximately 208,399 for the facility in Texas. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, R D expenses were 3,492,144 and 5,842,611, respectively, representing a decrease of 2,350,467 or 40 . The decrease was comprised primarily of 1,437,862 of labor and other R D costs allocated to cost of revenue due to the increase in service revenue, 779,425 related to a planned decrease in R D consulting services to conserve cash and a 232,829 decrease in stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in building related expenses of approximately 273,709 for the facility in Texas. We expect that our R D expenses will increase as we expand our future operations and as our cash position improves. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of stock-based compensation, marketing and advertising, salaries, payroll taxes and other benefits, Board compensation, accounting and tax, consulting fees, travel and entertainment, rent expense, office expenses, and legal and professional fees.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses were 2,735,419 and 4,612,824, respectively, representing a decrease of 1,877,405 or 41 . The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation due to clawing back amortization for unvested, cancelled restricted stock awards of 638,592, a decrease in advertising expense of 571,238 due to a sponsorship agreement terminating in 4Q23, and a decrease of 481,661 in depreciation expense primarily due to leasehold improvements for the San Diego facility being fully depreciated in 2Q24.

Other (Expense) Income For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other expense, net, was a net expense of 293,464 and 465,246, respectively, representing a decrease of 171,782, or 37 . The change is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest expense of 158,686 due to the full repayment of the prepaid advance liability during 1Q24, a decrease of 56,210 due to the change in fair value of of accrued issuable equity, partially offset by an increase of 43,114 for amortization of debt discount in connection with merchant cash advances. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other expense, net, was a net expense of 1,209,073 and 1,062,401, respectively, representing an increase of 146,672, or 14 . The change is primarily attributable to an increase of 284,516 for amortization of debt discount in connection with merchant cash advances, an increase of 180,289 for the change in fair value of accrued issuable equity and 31,358 related to a 2024 loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the Prepaid Advance Liability, partially offset by a decrease of 349,491 in interest due to the full repayment of the prepaid advance liability during 1Q24. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024 and December 2023, we had cash balances of 912,417 and 1,194,764, respectively, and a working capital deficit of 1,157,755 and 2,994,753, respectively.

 Our primary source of liquidity has historically been cash generated from equity and debt offerings. Under ASC Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern ASC 205-40 ), we have the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet future financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. We have a history of recurring net losses, recurring use of cash in operations and declining working capital. On July 3, 2024, the Company entered into an At the Market Offering agreement (the ATM to raise up to 20,000,000 through sales of the Company s common stock. During the period from October 1, 2024 through November 12, 2024, the Company has sold 13,045,200 shares of common stock pursuant to this offering, with gross proceeds of 4,319,699. As of the filing date of this Quarterly Report, our outstanding notes payable have been reduced to 1,060,831. As of the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements, the Company has no additional commitments to obtain additional funding through future debt or equity financings, and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Further, there is no assurance that the amount of funds the Company might raise will enable the Company to complete its development initiatives or attain profitable operations. The aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements There are no off-balance sheet arrangements between us and any other entity that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on financial conditions, changes in financial conditions, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Estimates We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial results will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are described in the notes to our financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. There are items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical, as defined above.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1) and are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations of the Effectiveness of Controls Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
