We exclude the impact of restricted stock from the calculation of diluted net loss per common share in periods where we have a net loss or when their inclusion would be antidilutive. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , we excluded shares of unvested restricted stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 , we excluded shares of unvested restricted stock. 

Except for product defects, no right of return exists on the sale of our products. We estimate returns based on historical experience and recognize a returns liability for any estimated returns. As of September 30, 2024 , we have an estimated returns liability of approximately million. 
 
 We currently own certain U.S. patents, and each patent s corresponding foreign patent applications. All of these patents and patent rights relate to the ingredient known as beta-alanine marketed and sold under our CarnoSyn and SR CarnoSyn trademarks, and our TriBysn tradename. We recorded beta-alanine raw material sales and royalty and licensing income as a component of revenue in the amount of million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 . We similarly recorded million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 . These royalty income and raw material sale amounts resulted in royalty expense paid to the original patent holders from whom NAI acquired their patents and patent rights. We recognized royalty expense as a component of cost of goods sold in the amount of approximately during the three months ended September 30, 2024 .

NAI intends to construct substantial improvements to the facilities including but not limited to installation of an approximately million solar electrical generating system on both buildings, and other substantial improvements. Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the Landlord will reimburse NAI for up to million of these tenant improvements to the buildings. Our lease liability and Right of Use asset were both increased by approximately million as a result of this lease extension effective on the date that the Fourth Amendment was executed. 
 
 On January 26, 2024, we exercised the early termination of an apartment lease in Lugano, Switzerland. The early termination reduced the lease term by 9 years and 8 months thus ending on April 30, 2024. Our lease liability and Right of Use asset were both decreased by approximately million as a result of the early termination of the early termination of the lease agreement. On January 22, 2024, we entered into a lease for a new apartment in Lugano, Switzerland. This lease is for an initial term of months, beginning April 1, 2024 and ending on June 30, 2026. 
 
 Our leases are classified as operating leases. Substantially all our operating leases are comprised of payments for the use of manufacturing and office space. We have no leases classified as finance leases.

million and allowed us to use the credit facility for working capital as well as potential acquisitions. On August 18, 2021, we entered into an amendment of that credit facility with Wells Fargo. The amended credit facility added a million term loan to the existing million credit facility and permitted us to use the 10.0 million term loan as part of the million purchase consideration for the acquisition of our manufacturing and warehouse property in Carlsbad, California. The amended credit agreement also increased the allowed capital expenditures from million to million for fiscal 2022 (exclusive of the amount paid for the acquisition of the new Carlsbad property noted above). In addition, the revised credit notes reflected a change in the interest rate reference from London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The Credit Agreement was amended and a new Revolving Line of Credit Note and Security Agreement were entered into. A Term Note and real property security documents were added to secure the Term Note by the Carlsbad property. 
 
 Subsequently we entered into a Second and Third Amendment that changed certain limits on our use of the line of credit. 
 
 On December 31, 2023, we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants, including those related to net income requirements and the fixed charge coverage ratio. On February 13, 2024, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to our credit facility with Wells Fargo that waived all prior instances of non-compliance, decreased our total borrowing capacity on the line of credit to million, increased the interest rate on borrowings under the line of credit to from above the daily simple SOFR rate, modified our continuing compliance requirements, and reduced the uses we can fund with the line of credit. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, our new borrowing eligibility requirements including maintaining (i) a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth of not greater than to 1.0 at any time; (ii) limits our losses to a decreasing amount over the next three quarters, with net income after taxes of not less than by September 30, 2024; iii) a rolling four -quarter fixed charge coverage ratio not less than to 1.0 as of December 31, 2024 and each quarter thereafter. The Fourth Amendment includes a limitation on the amount of capital expenditures that can be made in a given fiscal year, with such limitation set at million, requires us to suspend share repurchase and dividend activity, and includes an availability reserve of that will be in place until we return to profitability. Any amounts outstanding under the line of credit bear interest at a fixed or fluctuating interest rate as elected by us from time to time. Any amounts outstanding under the line of credit must be paid in full on or before the maturity date of which remains May 23, 2025. Amounts outstanding that are subject to a fluctuating interest rate may be prepaid at any time without penalty. Amounts outstanding that are subject to a fixed interest rate may be prepaid at any time in minimum amounts of , subject to a prepayment fee equal to the sum of the discounted monthly differences between payment under a fixed rate versus payment under the variable rate for each month from the month of prepayment through the month in which the then applicable fixed rate term matures. There is an unused commitment fee of required as part of the line of credit, and an origination fee of which we paid upon execution of the Fourth Amendment. 
 
 The Term Note used as part of the purchase consideration of our powder processing and warehouse property in Carlsbad, California referenced above, was for the original principal amount of million, and is a seven -year term note with payments fully amortized based on a twenty-five year assumed term. Installment payments under this loan commenced October 1, 2021, and continue through August 1, 2028, with a final installment consisting of all remaining amounts due to be paid in full on September 1, 2028. Amounts outstanding on this note during the term of the agreement bear interest equal to above the SOFR rolling 30 -day average. In connection with this term loan, we entered into an interest rate swap with Wells Fargo that effectively fixed our interest rate on our term loan at for the first three years of the term of the note which expired on September 3, 2024. 

Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by our accounts receivable and other rights to payment, general intangibles, inventory, equipment and fixtures. We also have credit approval with Wells Fargo Bank, which allows us to hedge foreign currency exposures up to 30 months in the future. We also have credit approval with Bank of America which allows us to hedge foreign currency exposures up to 24 months in the future. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had million outstanding under the Term Note used in August 2021 for the purchase of our Carlsbad, California powder processing and warehouse property. 
 
 On September 30, 2024 , we were not in compliance with the financial covenants related to net income requirements as noted above in item (ii) associated with the Fourth Amendment to our credit facility. In the next two quarters of fiscal 2025, we anticipate we will not be in compliance with the financial covenants associated with the Fourth Amendment to our credit facility related to net income requirements as noted in item (ii) above and the fixed charge coverage ratio as noted in item (iii) above. We have advised the lender and are currently negotiating a potential revised credit facility or waiver. Wells Fargo has advised us that while they consider our request for a waiver or modification, they will not be exercising any of their options pursuant to the Credit Agreement, but they are reserving all of their rights. There can be no assurance we will be able to successfully negotiate a revised credit facility, or what the differences in amount, cost and other factors may be.

 We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , there was no change to our valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets.

The Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo effective February 13, 2024, currently prohibits most stock repurchases (see Note F). Until that restriction is modified or removed, we do not intend to purchase our shares other than our longstanding practice of purchasing shares from our employees in exchange for paying the employees withholding requirements upon vesting of restricted stock held by the employee. This practice of covering withholding requirements is provided in the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. 
 
 Stock repurchases for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , were as follows: 

Shares acquired from employees for restricted stock vesting 
 Total 

There were no stock repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Shares acquired from employees for restricted stock vesting may be returned to us by the related employees and in return we pay each employee s required tax withholding resulting from the vesting of restricted shares. The valuation of the shares acquired and thereby the number of shares returned to us is calculated based on the closing share price on the date the shares vested. 

million (EUR million). As of September 30, 2024 , a net loss of approximately million, offset by approximately million of a deferred tax expense, related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges was recorded in OCI. It is expected that the entire amount will be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months along with the earnings effects of the related forecasted transactions. 
 
 For foreign currency contracts not designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedge are recorded directly to foreign exchange gain or loss in other income in an effort to offset the change in valuation of the underlying hedged item. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , we entered into forward contracts in order to hedge foreign exchange risk associated with our lease liability at NAIE, which is denominated in Swiss Francs (CHF). As of September 30, 2024 , the notional amounts of our foreign exchange contracts not designated as cash flow hedges were approximately million (CHF million). 
 
 We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations related to our million Term Note with Wells Fargo, which carries a variable interest rate of above the SOFR rolling 30 -day average. To manage our exposure to this variable rate, on August 23, 2021, we entered into a floored interest rate swap that fixed our all-in rate on this loan to for the first three years of the term loan. Fluctuations in the relation of our contractual swap rate to current market rates are recorded as an asset or liability with an offset to OCI at the end of each reporting period. Interest expense is adjusted for the difference between the actual SOFR spread and the swap contractual rate such that our effective interest expense for each period is equal to our hedged rate of 2.4 . This interest rate swap contract expired on September 3, 2024. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis are intended to help you understand our financial condition and results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024. You should read the following discussion and analysis together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included under Item 1 in this Report, as well as the risk factors and other information included in our 2024 Annual Report and other reports and documents we file with the SEC. Our future financial condition and results of operations will vary from our historical financial condition and results of operations described below based on a variety of factors. 
 
 Executive Overview 
 
 The following overview does not address all of the matters covered in the other sections of this Item 2 or other items in this Report nor does it contain all of the information that may be important to our stockholders or the investing public. You should read this overview in conjunction with the other sections of this Item 2 and this Report. 
 
 Our primary business activity is providing private-label contract manufacturing services to companies that market and distribute vitamins, minerals, herbal and other nutritional supplements, as well as other health care products, to consumers both within and outside the U.S. Historically, our revenue has been largely dependent on sales to two or three private-label contract manufacturing customers and subject to variations in the timing of such customers orders, which in turn is impacted by such customers internal marketing programs, supply chain management, entry into new markets, new product introductions, the demand for such customers products, and general industry and economic conditions. Our revenue also includes raw material sales, and royalty and licensing revenue generated from license and supply agreements with third parties, granting them the right to use our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property in connection with the distribution and use of the ingredient known as beta-alanine sold under our CarnoSyn and SR CarnoSyn trademarks. 
 
 A cornerstone of our business strategy is to achieve long-term growth and profitability and to diversify our sales base. We have sought and expect to continue to seek to diversify our sales by developing relationships with additional, quality-oriented, private-label contract manufacturing customers, and commercializing our patent estate through sales of beta-alanine under our CarnoSyn , SR CarnoSyn trademarks, and TriBsyn trade name, royalties from license agreements, and potentially additional contract manufacturing opportunities with licensees. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net sales were 2 lower than in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Private-label contract manufacturing sales decreased 5 primarily due to reduced orders from one of our larger customers, partially offset by increased shipments to a majority of our other existing customers and shipments to new customers. Revenue concentration for our largest private-label contract manufacturing customer as a percentage of total net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 37 , and revenue concentration for our largest private-label contract manufacturing customer as a percentage of total net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 36 . We expect our annualized fiscal 2025 revenue concentration for our largest customer to be slightly lower as compared to our revenue concentration for our largest customer in fiscal 2024. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, patent and trademark licensing revenue increased 42 to 2.5 million compared to revenue of 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in patent and trademark licensing revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to decreased volume rebates and an increase in orders from existing customers. 
 
 We continue to invest in research and development for the expansion of our CarnoSyn product offerings. We believe SR CarnoSyn may provide a unique opportunity within the growing Wellness and Healthy Aging markets but acceptance of this product offering has been limited as we only offer this product in tablet form. In August 2024, we announced our new product called TriBsyn . We believe TriBsyn may allow us to better penetrate the Wellness and Healthy Aging channel. This groundbreaking new product is a carnosine booster that utilizes CarnoSyn beta-alanine and other patent-pending technology to increase beta-alanine bioavailability and absorption while effectively eliminating beta-alanine related paresthesia. This product is available as a raw material powder, which allows formulation flexibility for our customers. The elimination of paresthesia while maintaining efficacy of dosage creates a new opportunity to reach segments of the market that to date have been untapped, including older adults, vegetarians, and vegans. We believe our efforts to refine our formulations and product offerings will be positively received and result in significant opportunity for increased sales of our patented products. We are also working on several additional innovations that could lead to new patentable products for CarnoSyn Brands in the future. 
 
 To protect and grow our CarnoSyn product offerings, we incurred litigation and patent compliance expenses of approximately 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our legal expense associated with our CarnoSyn business has remained relatively low as we have no active litigation, and our current run-rate of expenses is primarily related to maintenance of our patent and trademark estate. Our ability to maintain or further increase our beta-alanine royalty and licensing revenue will depend in large part on our ability to develop a market for our sustained release form of beta-alanine marketed under our SR CarnoSyn trademark and our new TriBsyn product, maintain our patent rights, the availability and the cost of the raw material when and in the amounts needed, the ability to expand distribution of beta-alanine to new and existing customers, and continued compliance by third parties with our license agreements and our patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights. During the remainder of fiscal 2025, we will continue our sales and marketing activities to consumers, customers, potential customers, and brand owners on multiple platforms to promote and reinforce the features and benefits of utilizing CarnoSyn , SR CarnoSyn , and TriBsyn , beta-alanine products. 
 
 We experienced a loss from operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to reduced sales and a change in sales mix from our private-label contract manufacturing segment and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing costs were negatively impacted by increased labor, supplies, rent, and freight costs. Although our overall sales forecast for fiscal 2025 includes a significant increase in sales as compared to fiscal 2024, we now anticipate we will experience a net loss in the first half of fiscal 2025, net income in the second half of fiscal 2025, and an overall net loss for the fiscal 2025 year.

During fiscal 2025, we plan to continue our focus on: 

Leveraging our state-of-the-art, certified facilities to increase the value of the goods and services we provide to our highly valued private-label contract manufacturing customers, and assist us in developing relationships with additional quality-oriented customers; 

Expanding the commercialization of our beta-alanine patent estate through raw material sales, developing a new sales distribution channel under the Wellness and Healthy Aging category for our sustained release form of beta-alanine marketed under our SR CarnoSyn trademark, developing a market for our new TriBsyn beta-alanine product, exploiting new contract manufacturing opportunities, license and royalty agreements, and protecting our proprietary rights; and 

Improving operational efficiencies and managing costs and business risks to improve profitability. 

Discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 We have identified the following as our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and that require management s most subjective and complex judgments. Information regarding our other significant accounting estimates and policies is disclosed in Note A of Item 1 in Part I of this report and as disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report. 
 
 Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured as the net amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for fulfilling one or more performance obligations. For certain contracts with volume rebates, our estimates of future sales used to assess the volume rebate estimates are subject to a high degree of judgement and may differ from actual sales due to, among other things, changes in customer orders and raw material availability.

Private-label contract manufacturing net sales decreased 5 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease in net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to reduced orders from one of our larger customers, partially offset by increased shipments to a majority of other existing customers and shipments to new customers. 
 
 Net sales from our patent and trademark licensing segment increased 42 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in patent and trademark licensing revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to decreased volume rebates, and an increase in orders from existing customers.

The change in gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was as follows:

(4.6)

Total change in gross profit margin 

(2.4) 

1 
 Private-label contract manufacturing gross profit margin as a percentage of consolidated net sales decreased 4.6 percentage points during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for private-label contract manufacturing during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to an unfavorable change in product sales mix and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing costs were negatively impacted by increased labor, supplies, rent, and freight costs. 

2 
 Patent and trademark licensing gross profit margin as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased 2.2 percentage points during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase in margin contribution was primarily due to increased patent and trademark licensing net sales in total and as a percentage of total consolidated net sales, as patent and trademark licensing historically provides higher profit margins than our private-label contract manufacturing business. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 0.4 million, or 11 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily related to an increase in compensation and benefits expenses, and legal and professional fees. 
 
 Other expense, net increased 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the comparable period during the prior year. The increase is primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency volatility, and increased interest expense due to usage of our credit facility, partially offset by an increase in interest income. 
 
 Our income tax benefit increased during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 to approximately 0.4 million when compared to our tax benefit of 0.2 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our tax benefit during the comparable periods is primarily due to an increase in our loss before income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows provided by operating activities and the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities. Net cash used in operating activities was 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 4.5 million in the comparable period during the prior fiscal year. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, changes in accounts receivable, consisting of amounts due from our private-label contract manufacturing customers and our patent and trademark licensing activities, used 0.7 million in cash compared to using 2.7 million of cash during the comparable three-month period in the prior year. The decrease in cash used in accounts receivable during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily resulted from the timing of sales and related collections. Days sales outstanding was 48 days during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 23 days for the prior year period. 
 
 Changes in inventory used 1.7 million in cash during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to providing 6.4 million in the comparable prior year period. The change in cash related to inventory during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily related to the difference in the amount and timing of orders and anticipated sales as compared to same period in the prior year. Changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities used 2.3 million in cash during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to providing 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash flow activity related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts and payments. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.3 million compared to 1.3 million in the comparable prior year period. The decrease during the three-months ended September 30, 2024 was related to reduced capital expenditures during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 1.9 million compared to using 0.1 million in the comparable prior year period. The change in financing activities is primarily due to increased usage of our credit facility during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 12.5 million of borrowing capacity on our credit facility of which we had outstanding borrowings of 5.4 million. We also owed 9.2 million on a term loan secured by our Carlsbad, California powder processing and storage facility. As of June 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of 3.4 million on our line of credit, and we also owed 9.2 million on our term loan. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, we had 10.2 million in cash and cash equivalents of which, 9.9 million was held by NAIE. Overall, we believe our available cash, cash equivalents, potential cash flows from operations, and our line of credit will be sufficient to fund our current working capital needs and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months. On September 30, 2024, we were not in compliance with the financial covenants related to net income requirements associated with the fourth amendment to our credit facility. In the next two quarters of fiscal 2025, we anticipate we will not be in compliance with the financial covenants associated with the fourth amendment to our credit facility related to net income requirements and the fixed charge coverage ratio. We have advised the lender and are currently negotiating a potential revised credit facility or waiver. Wells Fargo has advised us that while they consider our request for a waiver or modification, they will not be exercising any of their options pursuant to the Credit Agreement, but they are reserving all of their rights. There can be no assurance we will be able to successfully negotiate a revised credit facility, or what the differences in amount, cost and other factors may be. Please see Note F, Item 1 of Part I of this report for terms of our current modified line of credit.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses that would be material to investors. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Recent accounting pronouncements are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 1, Note A of Part I of this Report. Other than those pronouncements, we are not aware of any other pronouncements that materially affect our financial position or results of operations. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We maintain certain disclosure controls and procedures as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. They are designed to help ensure that material information: (1) is gathered and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding required disclosures; and (2) recorded, processed, summarized, reported and filed with the SEC as required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and within the time periods specified by the SEC. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective for their intended purpose as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we become involved in various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These matters may relate to intellectual property, product liability, employment, tax, regulation, contract or other matters. The resolution of these matters as they arise will be subject to various uncertainties and, even if such claims are without merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. While unfavorable outcomes are possible, based on available information, we currently do not believe the resolution of these matters, even if unfavorable, will result in a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, or results of operations. However, a settlement payment or unfavorable outcome could adversely impact our results of operations. Our evaluation of the likely impact of these actions could change in the future and we could have unfavorable outcomes we do not expect. An unexpected settlement expense or an unexpected unfavorable outcome of a matter could adversely impact our results of operations. 
 
 As of November 13, 2024, neither NAI nor NAIE were a party to any material pending legal proceeding nor was any of our property the subject of any material pending legal proceeding. We are often involved in up to several matters in the ordinary course of our business. 
 
 There is no assurance NAI will prevail in litigation matters or in similar proceedings NAI or others may initiate, or that litigation expenses will not be greater than anticipated. 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

When evaluating our business and future prospects you should carefully consider the risks described under Item 1A of our 2024 Annual Report, as well as the other information in our 2024 Annual Report, this Report and other reports and documents we file with the SEC. If any of the identified risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a portion of the value of your investment in our common stock. 
 
 Geopolitical Instability and Conflict in the Region 
 
 Our business operations may be adversely affected by ongoing geopolitical instability including conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. These regional tensions may lead to increased political, economic, and security risks, including disruptions in the global supply chain, fluctuations in energy prices, and financial market volatility. Such uncertainties could impact our ability to operate efficiently, access markets, and secure resources. Our financial performance and results may be influenced by these external factors, and we cannot predict the future impact of geopolitical events on our business with certainty. 

ITEM 2. 
 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

We did not sell any unregistered equity securities during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.
