million in cash consideration. The Carevoyance assets meet the definition of a business and accordingly, the Company has accounted for the Carevoyance transaction under the acquisition method. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values and the results of operations were included in the Company s consolidated results prospectively from the acquisition date. The purchase price allocations for the Carevoyance acquisition are provisional and are based on the information that was available as of the acquisition date to estimate the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company is gathering and reviewing additional information necessary to finalize the values assigned to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed, as well as acquired identified intangible assets and goodwill. Therefore, the provisional measurements of fair values reported as of September 30, 2024 are subject to change.

As a result of the Carevoyance acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill, developed technology, customer relationships, and tradename of million, million, million, and million, respectively, as of the acquisition date. The goodwill recognized includes the fair value of the assembled workforce, which is not recognized as an intangible asset separable from goodwill, and any expected synergies gained through the acquisition. The Company determined that the goodwill resulting from the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. All goodwill has been allocated to the Company s one reportable segment. The developed technology represents Carevoyance s proprietary solutions that are designed to assist MedTech customers with improving segmentation, targeting, and prospect engagement. The Company used the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, to determine the value of developed technology. Significant assumptions include an obsolescence factor, tax rate, and discount rate. The developed technology was valued at million and is amortized using the economic value method, which represents the pattern of cash flows over the estimated life of this asset. Customer relationships represent the estimated fair value of the underlying relationships with the acquired entity s business customers. The Company valued customer relationships using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method. Significant assumptions include estimated attrition rates, discount rates, and tax rates reflecting the different risk profiles of the asset depending upon the acquisition. The value assigned to customer relationships is million and is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated remaining useful life of . The tradename represents the estimated fair value of the registered trade name associated with the Carevoyance corporate brand. The Company estimated the fair value of the trademark using a relief from royalty method of the income approach. Significant assumptions include forecast of royalty rate, tax rate, and discount rate. The trademark was valued at million and is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated remaining useful life of . In total, intangible assets acquired in the Carevoyance acquisition are estimated to be amortized over a weighted average of years. See Note 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets for the estimated total intangible amortization expense during the next five years. Pro forma results of operation for this acquisition have not been presented because the effects were not material to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial results.

The goodwill recognized includes the fair value of the assembled workforce, which is not recognized as an intangible asset separable from goodwill, and any expected synergies gained through the acquisition. The Company determined that the goodwill resulting from the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. All goodwill has been allocated to the Company s one reportable segment. The developed software represents Populi s proprietary solutions that are designed to assist organizations in optimizing physician relationships, reducing network leakage, and expanding market share. The Company used the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, to determine the value of developed software. Significant assumptions include an obsolescence factor, tax rate, and discount rate. The developed software was valued at million and is amortized using the economic value method, which represents the pattern of cash flows over the estimated life of this asset.

million and million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The goodwill impairment charges did not affect the Company s liquidity or the financial covenants in its outstanding debt agreement. In calculating the goodwill impairment charges, the Company estimated the fair value of its single reporting unit based on its market capitalization and an appropriate control premium. Market capitalization is determined by multiplying the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding by the market price of its Class A Common Stock. The control premium, or the amount paid by a new controlling shareholder for the benefits resulting from synergies and other potential benefits derived from controlling the acquired company, is determined by utilizing data from publicly available premium studies for similarly situated public company transactions. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and the fair value.

The Company also considered its intangible assets with finite useful lives, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally on a straight-line basis. These assets are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. The Company experienced two separate triggering events in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from declines in the Company s market capitalization driven by sustained decreases in the Company s stock price. In each case, the Company s intangible assets were reviewed for impairment. Based on quantitative and qualitative analyses performed, management concluded the assets were recoverable and no impairment charges were recorded as a result of either triggering event.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid million in outstanding principal of the 2021 Term Loan (as defined below). 2021 Credit Agreement In September 2021, DH Holdings entered into a credit agreement (the 2021 Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, the other lenders party thereto and the other parties specified therein. The 2021 Credit Agreement provides for (i) a million term loan A facility (the 2021 Term Loan and (ii) a million revolving credit facility (the 2021 Revolving Line of Credit and, together with the 2021 Term Loan, collectively, the 2021 Credit Facilities ), the proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the indebtedness outstanding under a previous credit agreement. Both the 2021 Term Loan and the 2021 Revolving Line of Credit mature on . The 2021 Credit Facilities include customary affirmative, negative, and financial covenants. The 2021 Credit Facilities are guaranteed by all of DH Holdings wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries and AIDH Buyer, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the direct parent company of DH Holdings, in each case, subject to customary exceptions, and are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of DH Holdings and the guarantors, including a pledge of the equity of DH Holdings, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. A balloon payment of approximately million will be due at the maturity of the 2021 Term Loan. There wa s million outstanding on the 2021 Term Loan at September 30, 2024. DH Holdings is required to pay the lenders under the 2021 Credit Agreement an unused commitment fee of between and per annum on the undrawn commitments under the 2021 Revolving Line of Credit, depending on the total net leverage ratio, quarterly in arrears. The expense is included in interest expense in the statements of operations. There was no outstanding balance on the 2021 Revolving Line of Credit at September 30, 2024 . In September 2023, the lessor of the Company s corporate headquarters transitioned from one entity to another. As a result, in December 2023, in lieu of a security deposit, the Company provided a standby letter of credit of million, which reduced the amount available under our revolving credit facility to million as of September 30, 2024. For both the 2021 Term Loan and 2021 Revolving Line of Credit, DH Holdings may elect from several interest rate options based on the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or the Base Rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the total leverage ratio beginning in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2024 , the effective interest rate was . In connection with the 2021 Credit Agreement, the Company capitalized financing costs totaling million, million for the 2021 Term Loan facility and million for the 2021 Revolving Line of Credit. The financing costs associated with the 2021 Term Loan facility are recorded as a contra-debt balance in Term loan, net of current portion in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the remaining life of the loan using the effective interest method. The financing costs associated with the 2021 Revolving Line of Credit are recorded in other assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet are amortized over the life of the arrangement. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the unamortized financing costs were million and million, respectively.

interest rate swap agreements, effective on March 31, 2022. Until October 31, 2022, the counterparties to each of the agreements paid the Company interest at a floating rate on the notional amounts based on the one-month USD-LIBO swap rate. On October 31, 2022, in conjunction with the amendment to the 2021 Credit Agreement (See Note 9. Long-Term Debt ), the Company amended the two interest rate swap agreements to replace the LIBO rate with Term SOFR. As a result, subsequent to October 31, 2022, the counterparties paid and will continue to pay interest at a floating rate based on Term SOFR. As of September 30, 2024 , the outstanding interest rate swap agreements each had a notional value of million with fixed interest rate s of and . Inter est payments under the swaps are made monthly on a net settlement basis. The Company has not recorded any amounts due to ineffectiveness for the period ended September 30, 2024 or year ended December 31, 2023 . The notional value of each interest rate swap agreement is expected to match the corresponding principal amount of a portion of our borrowings under the 2021 Term Loan. The swap agreements mature on . The derivative interest rate swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. Consequently, the change in the estimated fair value of the effective portion of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets and reclassified to interest expense, net, when the underlying transaction has an impact on earnings. The Company expects to recognize approximately million of net pre-tax gains from accumulated other comprehensive income as a reduction of interest expense in the next twelve months associated with its interest rate swaps. The Company recognizes derivative instruments and hedging activities on a gross basis as either assets or liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheets and measures them at fair value. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions.

Non-recurring fair value measurements Certain assets and liabilities, including property, plant, and equipment, lease right-of-use assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets, are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are remeasured when the derived fair value is below the carrying value on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. For these assets, the Company does not periodically adjust carrying value to fair value except in the event of impairment. When impairment has occurred, the Company measures the required charges and adjusts the carrying value as discussed in Note 2.

million and million, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate was and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The Company s effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of due to the valuation allowance recorded, foreign tax rates that differ from the U.S. statutory tax rate, and partnership income that is not taxed. The income of the Company s subsidiaries is generally subject to corporate-level taxation, and certain of these subsidiaries have a valuation allowance whereas others do not. The effective tax rates for each period generally arise from the tax provisions for Company subsidiaries without valuation allowances, and the impact of any revaluation of deferred taxes arising from changes in the states effective tax rates. Such revaluations are caused by changes in state apportionment factors arising from fluctuations in the mix of sales, property and payroll by state, certain state tax rate changes and certain state tax incentives. Tax Receivable Agreement Pursuant to the Company s election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ), the Company expects to obtain an increase in its share of the tax basis in the net assets of Definitive OpCo when LLC Interests are redeemed or exchanged by other members. The Company intends to treat any redemptions and exchanges of LLC Interest as direct purchases of LLC Interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that would otherwise be paid in the future to various tax authorities. They may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. In connection with the IPO, the Company entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement TRA among Definitive Healthcare Corp., Definitive OpCo, and the TRA Parties and has recorded a liability under the TRA of milli on and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized a TRA remeasurement gain of million and million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recognized a TRA remeasurement gain of million and million, respectively. Losses and gains in both periods were recognized within other income, net in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Under the TRA, the Company generally will be required to pay to the TRA Parties of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, or local tax that the Company actually realizes directly or indirectly (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) as a result of (i) certain tax basis adjustments resulting from (a) acquisitions by the Company of LLC Units from pre-IPO holders in connection with the IPO, and (b) subsequent redemptions or exchanges of LLC Units by holders for Class A Common Stock or other consideration, (ii) certain tax attributes acquired by the Company from the Blocker Companies in the Reorganization Transactions, and (iii) certain payments made under the TRA. The Company expects to benefit from the remaining of any tax benefits that it may actually realize. To the extent that the Company is unable to timely make payments under the TRA for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid.

Mr. Krantz founded the company to provide healthcare commercial intelligence that enables companies that compete within or sell into the healthcare ecosystem to make better, informed decisions and be more successful. Over time, we have expanded our platform with new intelligence modules, innovative analytics, workflow capabilities, and additional data sources. 
 We believe any company selling or competing within the healthcare ecosystem is a potential customer for us and contributes to our estimated current total addressable market of over 10 billion. In total, we have identified more than 100,000 potential customers that we believe could benefit from our platform.

Recent Developments 
 Acquisitions 
 On January 16, 2024, we completed the purchase of assets comprising the Carevoyance business line of H1 Insights, Inc., a product that helps medical technology MedTech customers improve segmentation, targeting, and prospect engagement for 13.7 million, subject to closing adjustments. The initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete as a result of the timing of the acquisition. Refer to Note 2. Acquisitions for further information. 
 Restructuring Charges 
 During the first quarter of 2024, we committed to a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins, and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth (the 2024 Restructuring Plan ). The 2024 Restructuring Plan provided for a reduction of the Company s current workforce by approximately 150 people. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred restructuring and related charges of 0.2 million and 8.0 million, respectively, consisting primarily of severance payments, employee benefits, and related cash expenses. These charges were recognized within transaction, integration, and restructuring expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. We do not expect to incur any additional material charges associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, due to our headquarters office consolidation, we recorded an impairment charge of 1.0 million, comprised of 0.7 million relating to the operating lease right-of-use assets, and 0.3 million relating to the leasehold improvements. These charges were recognized within transaction, integration, and restructuring expenses in our unaudited consolidated statements of operations. 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 During the second and third quarters of 2024, we experienced declines in our market capitalization as a result of sustained decreases in our stock price, which represented triggering events in both periods requiring our management to perform quantitative goodwill impairment tests as of the end of each reporting period. As a result of the impairment tests, we determined that the fair value of our single reporting unit was lower than its carrying value and, accordingly, recorded a non-cash, pre-tax, goodwill impairment charges 228.2 million and 363.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The goodwill impairment charges did not affect our liquidity or the financial covenants in our outstanding debt agreement. See Note 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets . Our reporting unit is at risk for future goodwill impairments if we experience a continued decline in our market capitalization or worsening macroeconomic conditions. 
 34 

Sales Execution Challenges 
 As part of the 2024 Restructuring Plan, we made significant changes to our go-to-market team that reduced overlay expenses, created a separate group and sales motion for our small and medium sized customers, and allocated more resources to our Enterprise Customers. These changes have created disruptions to our sales efforts in 2024, impacting both new customer acquisition and upsell to existing customers, which we expect will continue to impact our results for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 Our current and prospective customers and their business spendings are impacted by difficult macroeconomic conditions to varying degrees and as a result, in some cases we are observing deal cycles lengthen for new and existing customers, in part as a result of more stringent approval processes, as well as a significant number of deferred purchasing decisions. We are also experiencing heightened customer churn. These trends have been particularly pronounced for smaller customers and in the Life Science and Provider markets. This churn has impacted our revenue growth since 2023, and we expect this will continue to have an impact on our growth into fiscal year 2025. 
 As a corporation with a global footprint, we are subject to risks and exposures caused by significant events and their macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, the Russia-Ukraine war, the conflict in Israel and surrounding areas, global geopolitical tension and more recently, inflation and high interest rates, volatility in the capital markets, liquidity concerns at, and failures of, banks and other financial institutions, and related market uncertainty. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts, and the potential for future impacts, of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape. While our revenue and earnings have historically been relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the potential implications of these macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and overall financial position, particularly in the long term, introduce additional uncertainty. 
 We have been observing changes in the healthcare claims data market as a result of data source disruption earlier this year, including how data providers are reviewing pricing, data availability, and use terms, all of which may negatively impact the prices at which we acquire such data. We are continuing to evaluate these and other past and potential future direct and indirect impacts on our business and results of operations. 
 35 

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 We believe that the growth and future success of our business depend on many factors, including the following: 
 Acquiring New Customers 
 We plan to organically grow the number of customers that use our platform by increasing demand for our platform and penetrating our addressable market. Our results of operations and growth prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to attract new customers. We intend to drive new customer acquisition with our efficient go-to-market engine by continuing to invest in our sales and marketing efforts and developing new use cases for our platform. Customers generating more than 100,000 in Annual Recurring Revenue ARR ), which we refer to as Enterprise Customers , represent the majority of our ARR and are a key focus of our go-to-market programs. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we completed a project to refresh our customer hierarchy methodology to reflect industry consolidation and to better reflect our go-to-market strategy as we increased resources and focus on Enterprise Customers. In some cases, this consolidated certain existing customer legal entities under larger parent accounts, and therefore reduced total customer count. As a result, our customer counts are not directly comparable to previously reported values and prior year customer counts have been revised to also reflect the updated customer hierarchy methodology. We believe this view of customer counts better reflects our updated selling and go-to-market strategy. Using the updated methodology, our total customer count, which includes smaller customers, was approximately 2,570 as of September 30, 2024 compared with approximately 2,750 customers as of September 30, 2023. Though our total customer count has decreased as smaller customers have churned at disproportionately higher rates due to current macroeconomic conditions, our Enterprise Customer count has increased by one to 530 customers, as adjusted, as of September 30, 2024 compared with 529 customers, as adjusted, as of September 30, 2023. 
 The table below presents the customer counts under the former and updated methodologies for the periods ended:

We have identified more than 100,000 potential customers across the healthcare ecosystem that we believe could benefit from our platform. Our ability to attract and acquire new customers is dependent on the strength of our platform and effectiveness of our go-to-market strategy, as well as macroeconomic factors and their impact on our potential customers business spending. 
 36 

Expanding Relationships with Existing Customers 
 We believe there is a significant opportunity to generate additional revenue from our existing customer base of approximately 2,570 customers, as adjusted, as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our customers have historically increased their spending by adding functionality and by expanding use-cases across departments. Our customers are typically assigned to one of our vertically focused teams, which is responsible for driving usage and increasing adoption of the platform, identifying expansion opportunities, and driving customer renewals. Real-time input from these customer centric teams feeds directly into our product innovation teams, enhancing the development of new capabilities. We believe this feedback loop and our ability to innovate creates significant opportunities for continual existing customer expansion. Our ability to generate additional revenue from existing customers is also subject to such existing customers business spending trends and the impact of macroeconomic conditions thereon. 
 Our progress in expanding usage of our platform with our existing customers is demonstrated by our NDR, which is further described below. 
 Continuing to Innovate and Expand Our Platform 
 The growth of our business is driven in part by our ability to apply our deep healthcare domain expertise to innovate and expand our platform. We have continually created new products since our founding in 2011. We plan to continue to invest significantly into our engineering and research and development efforts to enhance our capabilities and functionality and facilitate the expansion of our platform to new use cases and customers. In addition, we work to continuously release updates and new features. While we are primarily focused on organic investments to drive innovation, we will also evaluate strategic acquisitions and investments that further expand our platform. 
 37 

Key Metrics 
 We monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate our business performance, identify financial trends, formulate business plans, and make strategic operational decisions. 
 Net Dollar Retention Rate NDR 
 We believe the growth in use of our platform by our existing customers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. We evaluate and report on our NDR on an annual basis to measure this growth. We define NDR as the percentage of ARR retained from existing customers across a defined period, after accounting for upsell, down-sell, pricing changes and churn. We calculate NDR as beginning ARR for a period, plus (i) expansion ARR (including, but not limited to, upsell and pricing increases), less (ii) churn (including, but not limited to, non-renewals and contractions), divided by (iii) beginning ARR for the same period. 
 Current Remaining Performance Obligations cRPO 
 We monitor current remaining performance obligations as a metric to help us evaluate the health of our business and identify trends affecting our growth. cRPO represents the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, including both deferred revenue and non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue within the next twelve months. cRPO is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth. In addition to total contract volume, cRPO is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, disparate contract terms, and the timing of renewals, because renewals tend to be most frequent in the fourth quarter. The value of contracts that included cancellation terms began to increase significantly during the third quarter of 2023 compared with prior periods as most of these contracts were inherited from the Populi acquisition. This precludes several millions of dollars of business from being included in the cRPO metric and puts further downward pressure on the cRPO growth rate. Due to these factors, it is important to review cRPO in conjunction with revenue and other financial metrics. 
 Our cRPO will continue to be impacted by macroeconomic challenges, which have resulted in elongating deal cycles as customers implement more stringent approval processes or push out final decisions to later periods. We have also observed cancelations due to the impacts of such challenges on the financial condition of our customers, particularly in the life science and provider markets. We expect this trend will continue to reduce our revenue growth rate for 2024 relative to 2023. 
 The fourth quarter of 2024 is an important sales and renewal quarter for us and will impact our trajectory heading into 2025. As reported, our cRPO exiting the third quarter of 2024 declined 4 year-over-year, which provides a solid indication of the challenges on revenue growth rates we anticipate in 2025. 
 The following table presents cRPO as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Impact of Acquisitions 
 We seek to enhance our platform, data and business through internal development and through acquisitions of and investments in businesses that broaden and strengthen our platform. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed the purchase of assets comprising the Carevoyance business line of H1 Insights, Inc., a product that helps MedTech customers to improve segmentation, targeting, and prospect engagement. Acquisitions can result in transaction costs, amortization expenses and other adjustments as purchase accounting requires that all assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2. Acquisitions in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further details. 
 38 

Components of our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we derived approximately 97 of our revenue from subscription services and the remainder from professional services. Our subscription services consist primarily of subscription fees for access to our platform. Our subscription contracts typically have a term ranging from 1 to 3 years and are non-cancellable. We typically bill for services in advance annually, and we typically require payment at the beginning of each annual period. Our subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. Our professional services revenue typically is derived from non-recurring consulting services which are generally capable of being distinct and can be accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue related to these professional services is recognized at the time the services are performed. 
 As part of the 2024 Restructuring Plan, we made significant changes to our go-to-market team that reduced overlay expenses, created a separate group and sales motion for our small and medium sized customers, and allocated more resources to our Enterprise Customers. These changes disrupted our sales efforts in the first half of 2024, coupled with continued macroeconomic headwinds and sales execution challenges in the second quarter. Although subscription renewals were in line with expectations, upsells, new business, and professional services, inclusive of transactional services and one-time consulting arrangements, were more heavily impacted than anticipated. Based on these impacts, we expect our revenue to decline in the final quarter of 2024 and into 2025 compared with the respective prior year periods. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of Revenue . Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology and data, consists of direct expenses related to the support and operations of our SaaS platform, such as data and infrastructure costs, personnel costs for our professional services, customer support, and data research teams, such as salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and other employee-related benefits, as well as allocated overheads. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in cost of revenue and that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will modestly increase as we add to our existing intelligence modules and invest in new products and data sources. Cost of data is included in the cost of revenue and is a fundamental driver of innovation. 
 Amortization . Includes amortization expense for technology and data acquired in business combinations and asset purchase agreements. We anticipate that amortization will only increase if we make additional acquisitions in the future. 
 During 2023, additional third-party data sources, inclusive of sources obtained through the acquisition of Populi in July 2023, were rolled out to our customers, which resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, an increase in cost of revenue, including amortization. We have been observing changes in the healthcare claims data market as a result of data source disruption earlier this year, including how data providers are reviewing pricing, data availability, and use terms, all of which may negatively impact the prices at which we acquire such data. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit is revenue less cost of revenue, and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Gross profit and gross margin have been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the costs associated with third-party data and third-party hosting services, leveraging economies of scale, and the extent to which we introduce new intelligence modules, features, or functionality, or expand our customer support and service organizations, hire additional personnel, or complete additional acquisitions. We expect that our gross profit and gross margin will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors. 
 We expect that gross profit margin for 2024 will continue to be impacted by the expansion of data sources, as described above, and costs associated with the acquisitions of Populi and Carevoyance, in addition to the anticipated second half 2024 revenue decline discussed above. We expect revenue declines to continue as we enter 2025. Revenue declines, in combination with our largely fixed cost structure, are expected to result in a decrease in gross profit margin in 2025. 
 39 

Operating Expenses 
 The most significant component of our operating expenses is personnel costs, which consist of salaries, bonuses, sales commissions, stock-based compensation, and other employee-related benefits. Operating expenses also include non-personnel costs such as facilities, technology, professional fees, and marketing. In light of macroeconomic conditions and their past and potential future impacts on our business, we have made efforts to contain our operating expenses, including implementing restructuring plans. Inflation, and in particular increases to the cost of labor due to cost-of-living increases, have negatively impacted our operating expenses, and we expect this to continue. However, inflation has not materially affected our business to date. 
 Sales and marketing . Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs such as salaries, bonuses, sales commissions, stock-based compensation, and other employee-related benefits for our sales and marketing teams, as well as non-personnel costs, including overhead costs, technology, and advertising costs. During the first quarter of 2024, as part of the 2024 Restructuring Plan, we made significant changes to our go-to-market team, which reduced overlay expenses, created a separate group and sales motion for small and medium sized customers, and allocated more resources to our Enterprise Customers. 
 Product development . Product development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs such as salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and other employee-related benefits for our engineering, data science and product teams, as well as non-personnel costs including overhead costs. We believe that our core technologies and ongoing innovation represent a significant competitive advantage for us, and we continue to invest in systems optimization and product improvements for our customers, enhance our software development team and invest in automation and artificial intelligence A.I. to drive higher quality data and deeper insights. 
 General and administrative . General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs such as salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and other employee-related benefits for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, IT and operations, and administrative teams, as well as non-personnel costs including overhead costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses. General and administration expenses also include sales tax amounts payable to taxation authorities, inclusive of interest and penalties, for customers that we did not collect sales taxes from, due to misclassifications of products and services for sales tax purposes. We do not expect sales taxes and related interest and penalties to be an ongoing component of our general and administrative expense as we complete voluntary disclosure agreements, register with certain tax authorities, and commence collection of sales taxes from customers in these tax jurisdictions. We have slowed hiring in response to macroeconomic conditions and do not expect to increase it until macroeconomic conditions improve. 
 Depreciation and Amortization . Depreciation and amortization expenses consist primarily of amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions and business combinations, as well as depreciation of property and equipment. We anticipate depreciation of property and equipment as a percentage of revenue to moderately decrease, although amortization will increase if we make additional acquisitions in the future. 
 Transaction, integration, and restructuring expenses . Transaction, integration, and restructuring expenses are costs directly associated with various acquisition, integration, and consolidation activities we have undertaken, primarily accounting and legal due diligence, and consulting and advisory fees, as well as expenses related to our restructuring plans and office consolidations. 
 Goodwill impairment . Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business combination. Substantially all of our goodwill was recognized in the purchase price allocations when our Company was acquired in 2019 by Advent, with smaller incremental amounts recognized in subsequent business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and more frequently if indicators of potential impairment arise. In conducting the impairment test, we first review qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. 
 When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that carrying value exceeds its fair value, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under the quantitative goodwill impairment test, if our reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, we will record an impairment charge based on that difference. We performed interim goodwill impairment tests during the second and third quarters of 2024 and concluded in each instance that the carrying value of the single reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded a 363.6 million and a 228.2 million non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment charge during each respective three-month period. 
 40 

Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Interest expense consists of interest expense on our debt obligations and the amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs. 
 Interest income consists of earnings resulting from our short-term investments. 
 Other income (expense), net consists primarily of the revaluation of tax receivable agreement liabilities and realized and unrealized gains and losses related to the impact of transactions denominated in a foreign currency. Significant changes in the projected liability resulting from the tax receivable agreement may occur based on changes in anticipated future taxable income, changes in applicable tax rates, or other changes in tax attributes that may occur and could affect the expected future tax benefits to be received by us. We do not have significant exposure to foreign exchange volatility and do not anticipate foreign currency transaction gains or losses to materially impact our results of operations.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue decreased 2.6 million, or 4 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in the prior year due to lower subscription revenue of 1.7 million and lower professional services revenue of 0.9 million. Revenue attributable to customers that existed prior to the start of 2024 decreased 7.9 million, which was partially offset by a 5.3 million increase in revenue from new customers in 2024. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue increased 1.8 million, or 15 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in the prior year. This increase was driven primarily by a 1.6 million increase in hosting fees and data subscription costs as a result of expanded customer usage of our platform and the Populi acquisition and an increase of 0.4 million in amortization expense resulting from new data purchases. These increases were partially offset by a 0.2 million decrease in personnel costs driven primarily by the 2024 Restructuring Plan. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses, which included a goodwill impairment charge of 228.2 million incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 287.4 million incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023 (refer to Note 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further details), decreased 74.4 million, or 21 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in the prior year. The decrease to operating expense as compared to the prior-year period was primarily due to a lower goodwill impairment charge in the current period, as well as: 
 A decrease in sales and marketing expense of 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by lower personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, resulting from the 2024 Restructuring Plan, along with a decrease in consulting fees; 

A decrease in product development expense of 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by lower personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, resulting from the 2024 Restructuring Plan and the departure of certain executive-level employees; 

A decrease in general and administrative expense of 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by lower personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, resulting from departures of certain executive-level employees in 2024, relief from sales tax exposure during the year, including penalties and interest, resulting from voluntary disclosure agreements, and lower professional service fees and franchise taxes; 

A decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by certain customer relationship intangible assets utilizing economic consumption amortization methods with lower amortization in the current period; and 

A decrease in transaction, integration, and restructuring expenses of 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by a gain in the current period resulting from an adjustment to the Populi contingent consideration and by higher costs incurred in the third quarter of 2023 associated with a commitment to a new restructuring plan during the prior year period. 

43 

Total Other Income, Net 
 Total other income, net was 23.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 29.2 million in the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the TRA liability remeasurement gain of 5.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in the prior year. The TRA liability remeasurement gain, which is driven primarily by the impairment of goodwill, as well as changes in future realizability of tax attributes payable under the TRA, was lower in the current period primarily as a result of a 59.2 million decrease in the goodwill impairment charge during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest income earned from our short-term investments of 0.3 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in the prior year and a decrease in interest expense of 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in the prior year. 
 Benefit from Income Taxes 
 Benefit from income taxes was 13.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17.5 million in the comparable prior year period. The overall decrease was primarily attributed to a smaller impairment of goodwill during the current period compared with the same period in the prior year. 
 44 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue increased 4.4 million, or 2 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in the prior year, due to higher subscription revenue of 4.3 million and higher professional services revenue of 0.1 million. Revenue attributable to new customers in 2024 increased 10.9 million, which was partially offset by a 6.5 million decrease in revenue from customers that existed prior to the start of 2024. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue increased 5.1 million, or 15 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in the prior year. This increase was driven primarily by a 4.4 million increase in hosting fees and data subscription costs as a result of expanded customer usage of our platform and the Populi acquisition, an increase of 0.7 million in amortization expense resulting from new data purchases, and an increase in other costs of 0.5 million. These increases were partially offset by a 0.5 million decrease in personnel costs driven primarily by the 2024 Restructuring Plan. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses, which include goodwill impairment charges of 591.8 incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 287.4 million incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (refer to Note 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further details), increased 290.9 million, or 62 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in the prior year. The increase to operating expense as compared to the prior-year period was primarily driven by higher goodwill impairment charges in the current period, partially offset by: 
 A decrease in sales and marketing expense of 7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by lower personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, resulting from the 2024 Restructuring Plan; 

A decrease in product development expense of 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by lower personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, resulting from the 2024 Restructuring Plan and the departure of certain executive-level employees; 

A decrease in general and administrative expense of 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by expense relief from sales tax exposure during the year, including penalties and interest, resulting from voluntary disclosure agreements, lower professional service fees, and lower recruiting fees. These decreases were partially offset by increased stock-based compensation expense resulting from new equity grants in the current year and the acceleration of certain shares in connection with the departure of executive-level employees, and increased fees and severance costs associated with a strategic transition initiative separate from our 2024 Restructuring Plan; 

A decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by certain customer relationship intangible assets utilizing economic consumption amortization methods with lower amortization in the current period; and 

A decrease in transaction, integration, and restructuring expenses of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by a gain on the adjustment to the Populi contingent consideration in the current period, along with higher acquisition related costs in the prior year period, partially offset by costs incurred in the current period associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan and impairment charges resulting from the consolidation of certain leased office facilities.

Total Other Income, Net 
 Total other income, net was 68.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23.7 million in the same period in the prior year. The overall change was primarily attributable to a 68.2 million TRA liability remeasurement gain in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by the impairment of goodwill, as well as changes in future realizability of tax attributes payable under the TRA, compared with a 25.0 million TRA liability remeasurement gain in the comparable prior year period. The increase in the TRA liability remeasurement gain year-over-year was primarily driven by an increase in the goodwill impairment charges of 304.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in the prior year. Interest income earned from our short-term investments also increased by 1.5 million to 11.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 9.9 million in the comparable prior year period. 
 Benefit from Income Taxes 
 Benefit from income taxes was 36.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19.7 million in the comparable prior year period. The overall increase was primarily attributed to a larger impairment of goodwill during the current period compared with the same period in the prior year.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe certain non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. Non-GAAP measures include, but are not limited to, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they eliminate certain items that affect period-over-period comparability and provide consistency with past financial performance and additional information about our underlying results and trends by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook. 
 We view Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin as operating performance measures. As such, we believe the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are GAAP Gross Profit and GAAP Gross Margin, respectively, and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin is GAAP net loss and GAAP net loss margin, respectively. 
 Non-GAAP measures are supplemental financial measures of our performance and should not be considered substitutes for net loss, gross profit, or any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP. This information should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items or events being adjusted. In addition, other companies may use different measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. 
 Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin 
 We define Adjusted Gross Profit as Gross Profit, excluding acquisition-related depreciation and amortization, and equity-based compensation costs. We exclude acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expenses as they have no direct correlation to the cost of operating our business on an ongoing basis. A small portion of equity-based compensation is included in cost of revenue in accordance with GAAP, but is excluded from our Adjusted Gross Profit calculations due to its non-cash nature. Gross Margin is defined as Gross Profit as a percentage of revenue and Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as Adjusted Gross Profit as a percentage of revenue. These are key metrics used by management and our board of directors to assess our operations. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of gross profit and gross margin to adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin for the periods presented:

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 We present Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of our operating performance. EBITDA is defined as earnings before (i) debt-related costs, including interest expense, (ii) interest income, (iii) income taxes, and (iv) depreciation and amortization. Management further adjusts EBITDA in its presentation of Adjusted EBITDA to exclude (i) other income, (ii) equity-based compensation, (iii) transaction, integration, and restructuring expenses, (iv) goodwill impairments, and (v) other non-core items. We exclude these items because they are by nature non-cash, non-recurring, and/or unrelated to our core operations, and therefore we do not believe them to be representative of ongoing operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are key metrics used by management and our board of directors to assess the profitability of our operations. We believe these metrics provide useful measures to investors to assess our operating performance and in measuring the profitability of our operations on a consolidated level.

(b) Equity-based compensation represents non-cash compensation expense recognized in association with equity awards made to employees and directors. 

(c) Transaction and integration expenses primarily represent legal, accounting, and consulting expenses and fair value adjustments for contingent consideration related to our acquisitions. Restructuring expenses relate to the 2024 Restructuring Plan and those we committed to during the first and third quarters of 2023, as well as impairment and restructuring charges related to office closures, relocations, and consolidations.

(d) Goodwill impairment represents non-cash, pre-tax, goodwill impairment charges. We experienced declines in our market capitalization as a result of sustained decreases in our stock price, which represented triggering events requiring our management to perform quantitative goodwill impairment tests as of the end of the second and third quarters of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. As a result of the impairment tests conducted in each respective period, we determined that the fair value of our single reporting unit was lower than its carrying value and, accordingly, recorded these impairment charges. 

(e) Other non-core items represent expenses driven by events that are typically by nature one-time, non-operational, and/or unrelated to our core operations. These expenses are comprised of non-core legal and regulatory costs isolated to unique and extraordinary litigation, legal and regulatory matters that are not considered normal and recurring business activity, including sales tax accrual adjustments inclusive of penalties and interest for sales taxes that we may have been required to collect from customers in 2024 and in certain previous years, and other non-recurring legal and regulatory matters. Other non-core items also include non-recurring consulting fees and severance costs associated with strategic transition initiatives, as well as professional fees related to financing, capital structure changes, and other non-recurring costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 137.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, 167.8 million of short-term investments, and 74.4 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, primarily from our IPO and follow-on offering, as well as the cash flows we generate from operations. Our principal uses of liquidity have been, and are expected to continue to be, primarily for investment in long-term growth of the business through capital expenditures, acquisitions, and repurchases of our Class A Common Stock, as well as debt services (see Note 9. Long-Term Debt for further details) and distributions to members of Definitive OpCo. 
 All of our business is conducted through Definitive OpCo and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, and the financial results are included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Definitive Healthcare Corp. Definitive Healthcare Corp. has no independent means of generating revenue. The Amended LLC Agreement provides that certain distributions will be made to cover Definitive Healthcare Corp. s taxes and such tax distributions are also expected to be used by Definitive Healthcare Corp. to satisfy its obligations under the TRA. We have broad discretion to make distributions out of Definitive OpCo. In the event Definitive Healthcare Corp. declares any cash dividend, we expect to cause Definitive OpCo to make distributions to us, in an amount sufficient to cover such cash dividends declared by us. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings, or cash flow of Definitive OpCo and its subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions. In addition, the terms of our 2021 Credit Agreement contain covenants that may restrict DH Holdings and its subsidiaries from paying such distributions, subject to certain exceptions. Further, Definitive OpCo and Definitive Healthcare Corp. are generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of Definitive OpCo and DH Holdings (with certain exceptions), as applicable, exceed the fair value of its assets. Subsidiaries of DH Holdings are generally subject to similar legal limitations on their ability to make distributions to DH Holdings. 
 We believe that our cash flow from operations, availability under the 2021 Credit Agreement and available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. We anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the issuance of additional equity, or a combination thereof. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. 
 Additionally, our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and fund our capital requirements are dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, and other factors that are beyond our control. See Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K and the factors described elsewhere in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and a potential recession, could increase our anticipated funding requirements. In the event we need to seek additional funding, high interest rates, stock market volatility, or other unfavorable macroeconomic conditions may also prevent us from obtaining additional financing on favorable terms or at all. Future adverse developments with respect to specific financial institutions or the broader financial services industry may lead to market-wide liquidity shortages that could impact us and our customers, and materially harm our business and financial condition. Our ability to access our cash, cash equivalents and investments, including transferring funds, making payments or receiving funds could be threatened and our ability to raise additional capital could be substantially impaired, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. In addition, if we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell or issue additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which could possibly result in additional expenses or dilution. 
 Credit Risk 
 Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, and trade and other receivables. We hold cash with reputable financial institutions that often exceed federally insured limits. We manage our credit risk by concentrating our cash deposits with high-quality financial institutions and periodically evaluating the credit quality of those institutions. The carrying value of cash approximates fair value. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 We do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. However, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset higher costs through price increases and our inability or failure to do so could potentially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 50.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of a net loss of 506.7 million, offset by non-cash charges of 567.0 million. The non-cash charges were primarily comprised of 591.8 million in goodwill impairment charges recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a gain on remeasurement of the TRA of 68.2 million, amortization of intangible assets of 36.8 million, a decrease in deferred taxes of 36.6 million, equity compensation costs of 30.7 million, and amortization of deferred contract costs of 11.5 million. The net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of 10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by cash outflows resulting from a decrease in deferred revenue of 12.1 million due to the timing of billings and cash received in advance of revenue recognition for subscription services, an increase in deferred contract costs of 8.3 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 7.2 million, and lower accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities, collectively, of 5.2 million. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of 23.1 million. 
 Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.1 million, driven primarily by 192.7 million in purchases of short-term investments and 13.5 million in cash paid, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Carevoyance in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by 207.5 million in maturities of short-term investments. 
 Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 43.4 million, driven by payments of 15.0 million for repurchases of our Class A Common Stock, repayments of the 2021 Term Loan (as defined below) of 10.3 million, taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards of 7.3 million, payments of 7.0 million under the TRA, distribution payments to members of 2.8 million, and payments of contingent consideration of 1.0 million. 
 Refer to Debt Obligations for additional information related to our debt obligations.

Debt Obligations 
 On September 17, 2021, DH Holdings entered into the 2021 Credit Agreement, providing for (i) a 275.0 million term loan A facility (the 2021 Term Loan and (ii) a 75.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2021 Revolving Line of Credit and, together with the 2021 Term Loan, collectively, the 2021 Credit Facilities ). The 2021 Credit Facilities are guaranteed by all of DH Holdings' wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries and AIDH Buyer, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the direct parent company of DH Holdings, in each case, subject to customary exceptions, and are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of DH Holdings and the guarantors, including a pledge of the equity of DH Holdings, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. The 2021 Term Loan of 275.0 million has a maturity date of September 17, 2026. The 2021 Term Loan was recorded net of 3.5 million in issuance costs, which are amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest method. 
 The 2021 Term Loan is subject to annual amortization of principal, payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter, commencing on the Initial Amortization Date, equal to approximately 2.5 per annum of the principal amount of the term loans in the first year and second year after the Initial Amortization Date and approximately 5.0 per annum of the principal amount of the term loans in the third year, fourth year, and fifth year after the Initial Amortization Date. A balloon payment of approximately 220.0 million will be due at maturity. There was 247.5 million outstanding on the 2021 Term Loan at September 30, 2024. 
 The 2021 Revolving Line of Credit is committed for 75.0 million and has a maturity date of September 17, 2026. There was no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. In September 2023, the lessor of the Company s corporate headquarters transitioned from one entity to another. As a result, in December 2023, in lieu of a security deposit, the Company provided a standby letter of credit of 0.6 million, which reduces the amount available under our revolving credit facility to 74.4 million. 
 On October 31, 2022, the Company amended the 2021 Credit Agreement to replace the LIBO rate with Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus an applicable rate. 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement includes certain financial covenants, and the Company was compliant with its financial covenants under the 2021 Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Financing Obligations 
 Financing obligations generally include repayment of principal amounts of the 2021 Term Loan, lease payments, and purchase obligations. There have been no material changes to our financing obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 5. Leases and Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024 for further information. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 In May 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 20.0 million of our Class A Common Stock, which expires on December 31, 2024. Repurchases may be effected, from time to time, either on the open market (including pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, and other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. 
 The timing and the amount of any repurchased Class A Common Stock will be determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program will be funded using our working capital. Any repurchased shares of Class A Common Stock will be retired. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of Class A Common Stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. As of September 30, 2024, 3,144,516 shares of Class A Common Stock have been repurchased under the repurchase program. 
 52 

Tax Receivable Agreement 
 In connection with the Reorganization Transactions and the IPO, the Company entered into the TRA with certain of our pre- IPO unitholders and the former shareholders of certain Blocker Companies. The TRA provides for the payment by Definitive Healthcare Corp. of 85 of the amount of any tax benefits that it actually realizes, or in some cases is deemed to realize, as a result of (i) certain tax attributes that it acquired from the Blocker Companies in the Reorganization Transactions (including net operating losses and the unamortized portion of the increase in tax basis in the tangible and intangible assets of Definitive OpCo and its subsidiaries resulting from the prior acquisitions of interests in Definitive OpCo by the Blocker Companies), (ii) certain tax basis adjustments resulting from the acquisition of LLC Units by Definitive Healthcare Corp., and (iii) certain payments made under the TRA. 
 In each case, these tax basis adjustments generated over time may increase (for tax purposes) the Definitive Healthcare Corp. s depreciation and amortization deductions and, therefore, may reduce the amount of tax that the Definitive Healthcare Corp. would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of the validity of that tax basis, and a court could sustain such a challenge. The anticipated tax basis adjustments upon redemptions or exchanges of LLC Units may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those assets. The payment obligations under the TRA are an obligation of Definitive Healthcare Corp., but not of Definitive OpCo. Definitive Healthcare Corp. expects to benefit from the remaining 15 of realized cash tax benefits. For purposes of the TRA, the realized cash tax benefits will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of Definitive Healthcare Corp. (calculated with certain assumptions) to the amount of such taxes that Definitive Healthcare Corp. would have been required to pay had there been no tax basis adjustments of the assets of Definitive Healthcare Corp. as a result of redemptions or exchanges and no utilization of certain tax attributes of the Blocker Companies, and had Definitive Healthcare Corp. not entered into the TRA. The term of the TRA will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless (i) Definitive Healthcare Corp. exercises its right to terminate the TRA for an amount based on the agreed payments remaining to be made under the agreement, (ii) Definitive Healthcare Corp. breaches any of its material obligations under the TRA in which case all obligations (including any additional interest due relating to any deferred payments) generally will be accelerated and due as if Definitive Healthcare Corp. had exercised its right to terminate the TRA, or (iii) there is a change of control of Definitive Healthcare Corp., in which case, all obligations (including any additional interest due relating to any deferred payments) generally will be accelerated and due as if Definitive Healthcare Corp. had exercised its right to terminate the TRA as described above in clause (i). Estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the TRA is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. The amount of the anticipated tax basis adjustments, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the TRA, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock at the time of an exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, the amount of tax attributes, and the amount and timing of our income. 
 We expect that as a result of the size of the anticipated tax basis adjustment of the tangible and intangible assets of Definitive OpCo upon the exchange or redemption of LLC Units and our possible utilization of certain tax attributes, the payments that Definitive Healthcare Corp. may make under the TRA will be substantial. The payments under the TRA are not conditioned upon continued ownership of us by the exchanging holders of LLC Units. See Note 15. Income Taxes in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 53 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As a requirement of our lease agreement for our corporate headquarters, in lieu of a security deposit, we provided a standby letter of credit of 0.6 million, which is effective through March 2038. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Capital expenditures decreased by 1.0 million to 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.4 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by lower spend on historical data purchases in the current year compared with the comparable prior year period. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness. Although actual amounts may differ from such estimated amounts, we believe such differences are not likely to be material. For additional detail regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates including business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and income taxes, see our discussion for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to these policies or estimates as of September 30, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial condition due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure due to potential changes in inflation, interest rates, or currency rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments primarily consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments in money market funds, U.S. government securities, and commercial paper. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 137.6 million and short-term investments of 167.8 million. 
 Our operating results are subject to market risk from interest rate fluctuations on our 2021 Term Loan, which bears a variable interest rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or a Base Rate plus an applicable margin. In order to reduce the interest rate risk on our debt, we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement on a portion of our borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, the total principal balance outstanding was 247.5 million. Excluding the effect of the interest rate swap agreement, a hypothetical 1.0 increase or decrease in the interest rate associated with borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement would have resulted in an impact to interest expense of approximately 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 To date, the majority of our sales contracts have been denominated in U.S. dollars. We have one foreign entity established in Sweden and one in India. The functional currencies of these foreign subsidiaries are the Swedish Krona and the Indian Rupee, respectively. Assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the reporting date and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded to non-operating loss. As the impact of foreign currency exchange rates has not been material to our historical results of operations, we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency becomes more significant.

ITEM 4. CO NTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on our management s evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 as a result of the material weakness discussed below. Notwithstanding this material weakness, our management concluded that our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). 
 Material Weakness 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 During 2023, we identified a material weakness in the design of our controls over the collection and remittance of sales taxes, as well as the accurate recording of our sales tax obligations in the financial statements. This material weakness remains unremediated as of September 30, 2024. Management is taking steps to remediate this material weakness (see Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weakness below for details). 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weakness 
 In response to the identified material weakness, management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has designed and implemented measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the material weakness. Our efforts include a number of actions: 
 We immediately engaged additional third-party tax experts to assist in the review of the classification for sales tax purposes of our existing products and services; 

We have designed and implemented additional sales tax nexus reviews, including controls over the monitoring of changes in our products and service offerings and identification of new and/or enhanced products and services, to put in place effective review controls over the classification of products and services for sales tax purposes; and 

We have designed and implemented controls over the collection, control, and subsequent monitoring of applicable documentation of exempt status from customers in affected jurisdictions. 

Our management believes that the measures described above will remediate the material weakness and strengthen our overall internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 56 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and governmental inspections, audits, or investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Although the outcomes of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these matters would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 For a more detailed discussion of our risks and uncertainties, see also Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in our risk factors since the filing of our 2023 Form 10-K.
