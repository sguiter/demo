 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

 (Unaudited) 

as of October 31, 2024.
For the foreseeable future, we expect to experience continuing operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. Cash available
at October 31, 2024, of will not provide enough working capital to meet our current operating expenses through the second quarter
of fiscal 2025. 

The operating deficit and negative working capital
at October 31, 2024 indicate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our continued existence depends on the
success of our efforts to raise additional capital necessary to meet our obligations as they come due and to obtain sufficient capital
to execute our business plan. We may obtain capital primarily through issuances of debt or equity or entering into collaborative arrangements
with corporate partners. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing additional financing or collaboration transactions
or, if financing is available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing
on a timely basis, we may be required to scale down or perhaps even cease operations. 

The issuance of additional equity securities could
result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans
would be available, would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. Our financial statements do not include adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

We are continually adjusting our business plan
to reflect our current liquidity expectations. If we are unable to raise additional capital, secure additional debt financing, secure
additional equity financing, secure a strategic partner, reduce our operating expenditures, or seek bankruptcy protection, we will adjust
our business plan. Given our recurring losses, negative cash flow, and accumulated deficit, there is substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. 

shares of Oragenics,
Inc. Oragenics common stock which is valued quarterly based on the common stock price as reported by the NYSE American
stock exchange. Our 511,308 shares of Oragenics common stock represented 4.2 of the outstanding shares of Oragenics common stock at October
31, 2024. 

We also hold shares of Oragenics convertible
Series F preferred stock (the Preferred Stock which is accounted for at cost minus impairments as it is not currently listed
on a registered securities exchange. The Preferred Stock is not accounted for as an equity-method investment as it does not have voting
rights nor board representation and management does not have significant influence over Oragenics. The Preferred Stock currently has a
value of zero.

Contingent Liabilities 

 At October
31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, we had contingent consideration related to the acquisition of intellectual property, know-how and patents
for an anti-choking, life-saving medical device in fiscal 2019. According to the agreement, we will make a one-time cash payment totaling
 upon FDA clearance of the device. The fair value of the contingent consideration is reviewed quarterly and determined based on
the current status of the project (Level 3). We determined the value was zero at both periods since it is not yet probable that we will
file for FDA clearance. 

We also had contingent
consideration at October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024 related to milestones in our Asset Purchase Agreement with Prevacus, Inc. The fair
value of the contingent consideration is reviewed quarterly and determined based on the current
status of the project (Level 3). Based on these reviews, the fair value of the contingent consideration was determined to be zero at both
periods as it is not yet probable that any of the milestones will be met. 

Fixed-Rate Debt 

 We have fixed-rate debt
that is reported on our consolidated balance sheets at carrying value less unamortized debt discount and closing costs. The fair value
of our fixed-rate debt was calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology with estimated current interest rates based on similar
risk profile and duration (Level 2). The carrying value, excluding unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs, and the fair value
of our fixed-rate long-term debt were as follows:

any amounts due under the Note for 30 days prior to us making payment. If LGH does not elect to make a conversion within the 30 days,
we will tender the full amount in the prepayment notice by paying 110 of the total outstanding balance including all principal, defaults
and interest to LGH within 5 calendar days. If LGH has previously provided a notice of conversion to us, we may not prepay any of the
amount included in such notice. All other terms and conditions remain the same.

Warrants

model is affected by our stock price, as well as by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables, including expected
stock price volatility, risk free interest rate, and term of the agreement. We estimate volatility based on historical volatility of
our common stock over the term of the debt. We record the fair value as a discount to debt and amortize it over the term of the
agreement. All warrants are deemed to be equity classified warrants in accordance with ASC 470. 

Warrant activity during the first quarter of 2025

Overview 

Our business model is to develop or acquire unique
medical related products, engage third parties to develop and manufacture such products and then distribute the products through various
distribution channels, including third parties. We have two different technologies in research and development stage; the CardioMap 
heart monitoring and screening device, and the Save a Life choking rescue device. To date, none of our product candidates have received
regulatory clearance or approval for commercial sale. 

We plan to license, improve, and develop our products
and identify and select distribution channels. We intend to establish agreements with distributors to get products to market quickly and
undertake and engage in direct marketing efforts as we move closer to regulatory approvals. We will determine the most effective distribution
method for each unique product we include in our portfolio. We will engage third-party research and development firms that specialize
in creating products to assist us in developing our own products, and we will apply for trademarks and patents once we have developed
proprietary products.

Significant Accounting Policies and Use of
Estimates 

During the three months ended October 31, 2024,
there were no significant changes to our significant accounting policies and estimates as described in Note 2. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies included in Part II, Item 8. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2024, which was filed

Results of Operations 

We do not currently sell or market any products
and we did not have any revenue in the three-month periods ended October 31, 2024 or 2023. We will commence actively marketing products
after the products and drugs in development have been FDA cleared or approved, but there can be no assurance, however, that we will be
successful in obtaining FDA clearance or approval for our products.

Research and Development 

 Research and development relates to our current
projects and includes expenses for clinical research, design and manufacturing, formulation, regulatory and consultants. 

Currently, we are not working on any research
and development projects. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

 The decrease in stock-based compensation was due
to fewer awards issued in recent quarters as well as a lower price for our common stock. 

General and Administrative Expense 

 General and administrative includes expenses related
to salaries and related benefits for employees in finance, accounting, sales, administrative and research and development activities,
as well as stock-based compensation, costs related to maintaining compliance as a public company and legal and professional fees. 

17 

The change in General and administrative expense
was due to the following:

18,401 

The decreases in wages and business development
and investor relations were due to fewer employees and lower activity throughout the company. 

Gain on Sale of Asset 

 The gain on sale of asset in fiscal 2024 relates
to our sale of our drug candidates for treating mild traumatic brain injury mTBI ), also known as concussion, and for treating
Niemann Pick Disease Type C NPC ), as well as our proprietary powder formulation and its nasal delivery device to Oragenics
in December 2023. 

Unrealized Losses on Investment 

 Unrealized losses on investment in relates to
the valuation of the common stock of Oragenics held by us as an investment. See Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information. 

Interest Expense 

 Interest expense includes interest on debt outstanding,
as well as the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs. Certain information regarding debt outstanding was as follows:

To date, we have financed our operations primarily
through debt financing and limited sales of our common stock. Our ability to continue to access capital could be affected adversely by
various factors, including general market and other economic conditions, interest rates, the perception of our potential future earnings
and cash distributions, any unwillingness on the part of lenders to make loans to us and any deterioration in the financial position of
lenders that might make them unable to meet their obligations to us. If these conditions continue and we cannot raise funds through a
public or private debt financing, or an equity offering, our ability to grow our business may be negatively affected. In such case, we
have suspended research and development activities until market conditions improve.

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide
information under this item. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management, with the participation of the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October
31, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer
and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded that, as of such date, as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control
over financial reporting that are described below in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective. 

As previously reported in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 management identified the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting: 

Insufficient Resources: We
have an inadequate number of personnel with requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. 

Inadequate Segregation
of Duties : We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures. 

We are committed to improving the internal controls
and will (1) continue to use third party specialists to address shortfalls in staffing and to assist us with accounting and finance responsibilities,
(2) increase the frequency of independent reconciliations of significant accounts, which will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties
until there are sufficient personnel, and (3) may consider appointing additional outside directors and audit committee members in the
future. 

In light of the material weakness described above,
prior to the filing of this Form 10-Q for the period ended October 31, 2024, management determined that key quarterly controls were
performed timely and also performed additional procedures, including validating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used
to support the amounts reported in the quarterly financial statements. These control activities and additional procedures have allowed
us to conclude that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses, the financial statements in this Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material
respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with United States GAAP. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There have
been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1A. 
 Risk Factors 

There have been no material changes during the
three-month period ended October 31, 2024 to the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July
31, 2024. If any of the identified risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. The trading
price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties
described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2024 are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that
we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. 

Item 2. 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

We issued an accredited investor, a warrant to
purchase 300,000 shares of our common stock at 0.10 per share that expires August 14, 2029, with a fair value of 13,343. 

In issuing these securities, we relied on an exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. 

Item 5. 
 Other Information 

During the quarter ended October 31, 2024, no
director or officer or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, 
as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
