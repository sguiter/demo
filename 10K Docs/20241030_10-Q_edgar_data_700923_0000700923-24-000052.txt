 , some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to , and some of which may include options to terminate the leases within . Currently, all the Company s leases contain fixed payment terms. The Company may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, in which case we are typically liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease. Additionally, all of the Company's month-to-month leases are cancelable, by the Company or the lessor, at any time and are not included in our right-of-use asset or liability. At September 30, 2024, the Company had several leases with residual value guarantees. Typically, the Company has purchase options on the equipment underlying its long-term leases and many of its short-term rental arrangements. The Company may exercise some of these purchase options when the need for equipment is ongoing and the purchase option price is attractive. Leases are accounted for as operating or finance leases, depending on the terms of the lease.

 post-acquisition period. The fair value was initially determined using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation methodology based on probability-weighted performance projections and other inputs, including a discount rate and an expected volatility factor. The fair value of this contingent earn-out consideration liability will be evaluated on an ongoing basis by management. Accordingly, the level of inputs used for these fair value measurements is the lowest level (Level 3). Significant changes in any of these assumptions could result in a significantly higher or lower potential liability. As of the acquisition date, the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration was million. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration was . The future payout of the contingent earn-out consideration, if any, is unlimited and could be significantly higher than the acquisition date fair value. If the minimum thresholds of the performance targets are achieved the contingent earn-out consideration payment will be approximately million.

Most MSAs include no obligation for the contract counterparty to assign specific volumes of work to the Company and do not require the counterparty to use the Company exclusively, although in some cases the MSA contract gives the Company a right of first refusal for certain work.

 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had billion of remaining performance obligations. The Company s remaining performance obligations include projects that have a written award, a letter of intent, a notice to proceed or an agreed upon work order to perform work on mutually accepted terms and conditions. The timing of when remaining performance obligations are recognized is evaluated quarterly and is largely driven by the estimated start date and duration of the underlying projects. 
 C I Total 
 The Company estimates approximately or more of the remaining performance obligations will be recognized within twenty-four months, including approximately of the remaining performance obligations estimated to be recognized within twelve months, although the timing of the Company s performance is not always under its control. The timing of when remaining performance obligations are recognized by the Company can vary considerably and is impacted by multiple variables including, but not limited to: changes in the estimated versus actual start time of a project; the availability of labor, equipment and materials; changes in project workflow; weather; project delays and accelerations; and the timing of final contract settlements. Additionally, the difference between the remaining performance obligations and backlog is due to the exclusion of a portion of the Company s MSAs under certain contract types from the Company s remaining performance obligations as these contracts can be canceled for convenience at any time by the Company or the customer without considerable cost incurred by the customer. Additional information related to backlog is provided in Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

 million in outstanding purchase orders for certain construction equipment, with cash payments scheduled to occur in 2024 and 2025. 
 Insurance and Claims Accruals 
 The Company carries insurance policies, which are subject to certain deductibles and limits, for workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and other insurance coverage. The deductible per occurrence for each line of coverage is up to million. The Company s health benefit plans are subject to stop-loss limits of up to million for qualified individuals. Losses up to the deductible and stop-loss amounts are accrued based upon the Company s estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. 
 The insurance and claims accruals are based on known facts, actuarial estimates and historical trends. While recorded accruals are based on the ultimate liability, which includes amounts in excess of the deductible, a corresponding receivable for amounts in excess of the deductible is included in current and long-term assets in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. 
 Performance and Payment Bonds and Parent Guarantees 
 In certain circumstances, the Company is required to provide performance and payment bonds in connection with its future performance on certain contractual commitments. The Company has indemnified its sureties for any expenses paid out under these bonds. As of September 30, 2024, an aggregate of approximately billion in original face amount of bonds issued by the Company s sureties were outstanding. The Company estimated the remaining cost to complete these bonded projects was approximately million as of September 30, 2024. 
 From time to time, the Company guarantees the obligations of wholly owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease agreements, and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors licenses. Additionally, from time to time the Company is required to post letters of credit to guarantee the obligations of wholly owned subsidiaries, which reduces the borrowing availability under the Facility.

 For performance awards, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the award. The fair value of internal metric-based performance awards is determined by the closing stock price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of market-based performance awards is computed using a Monte Carlo simulation. Performance awards are expensed over the service period of approximately years, and the Company adjusts the stock-based compensation expense related to internal metric-based performance awards according to its determination of the shares expected to vest at each reporting date.

 reporting segments, each a separate operating segment, which are referred to as T D and C I. Performance measurement and resource allocation for the reporting segments are based on many factors. The primary financial measures used to evaluate the segment information are contract revenues and income from operations, excluding general corporate expenses. General corporate expenses include corporate facility and staffing costs, which include safety costs, professional fees, IT expenses and management fees. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Note 1 Organization, Business and Significant Accounting Policies to the 2023 Annual Report. 
 Transmission and Distribution: The T D segment provides a broad range of services on electric transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities which include design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services with a particular focus on construction, maintenance and repair. T D services include the construction and maintenance of high voltage transmission lines, substations and lower voltage underground and overhead distribution systems, clean energy projects and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The T D segment also provides emergency restoration services. T D customers include investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, private developers, government-funded utilities, independent power producers, independent transmission companies, industrial facility owners and other contractors. 
 Commercial and Industrial: The C I segment provides services such as the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, the installation of intelligent transportation systems, roadway lighting, signalization and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Typical C I contracts cover electrical contracting services for airports, hospitals, data centers, hotels, stadiums, commercial and industrial facilities, clean energy projects, manufacturing plants, processing facilities, water/waste-water treatment facilities, mining facilities, and transportation control and management systems. The C I segment generally provides electric construction and maintenance services as a subcontractor to general contractors in the C I industry, but also contracts directly with facility owners. The C I segment has a diverse customer base with many long-standing relationships.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 This management s discussion and analysis provides a narrative on the Company s financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ). In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed herein under the captions Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements and Information and Risk Factors, as well as in the 2023 Annual Report. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements. 
 
 Overview and Outlook 
 We are a holding company of specialty electrical construction service providers that was established in 1995 through the merger of long-standing specialty contractors. Through our subsidiaries, we serve the electric utility infrastructure, commercial and industrial construction markets. We manage and report our operations through two electrical contracting service segments: Transmission and Distribution T D and Commercial and Industrial C I ). 
 We have operated in the transmission and distribution industry since 1891. We are one of the largest U.S. contractors servicing the T D sector of the electric utility industry and provide T D services throughout the United States and in Ontario, Canada. Our T D customers include many of the leading companies in the electric utility industry. We have provided electrical contracting services for commercial and industrial construction since 1912. Our C I segment provides services in the United States and in western Canada. Our C I customers include facility owners and general contractors. We strive to maintain our 
 status as a preferred provider to our T D and C I customers. 
 We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages in both of our segments, including our skilled workforce, extensive centralized fleet, proven safety performance and reputation for timely completion of quality work that allows us to compete favorably in our markets. In addition, we believe that we are better capitalized than some of our competitors, which provides us with valuable flexibility to take on additional and more complex projects. 
 We believe legislative actions aimed at supporting infrastructure improvements in the United States may positively impact long-term demand, particularly in connection with electric power infrastructure, transportation and clean energy spending. We believe the legislative actions are likely to provide greater long-term opportunity in both of our reporting segments. However, we expect our financial results, in both of our segments, to continue to be affected by delays and cost volatility through 2024, due to supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, tariffs and regulatory slowdowns. These factors will cause us to carry impacted projects at lower margins until their completion and may result in decelerations in project opportunities and awards. 
 We had consolidated revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 2.53 billion, of which 56.5 was attributable to our T D customers and 43.5 was attributable to our C I customers. Our consolidated revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 2.64 billion. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net income and EBITDA (1) were 14.3 million and 72.3 million, respectively, compared to 66.9 million and 135.4 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We believe there is an ongoing need for utilities to sustain investment in their transmission systems to improve reliability, reduce congestion, connect to new clean energy sources and support future load growth. Consequently, we believe that we will continue to see continued bidding activity on large transmission projects going forward. The timing of multi-year transmission project awards and substantial construction activity is difficult to predict due to regulatory requirements and the permitting needed to commence construction. Significant construction on any large, multi-year projects awarded in the remainder of 2024 will not likely begin until 2025. Bidding and construction activity for small to medium-size transmission projects and upgrades remain active, and we expect this trend to continue. 
 We believe there is a need for further investment by utilities on their distribution systems to properly maintain or meet reliability requirements. We continue to see strong bidding activity in some of our electric distribution markets. We believe the increased storm activity and destruction caused by wildfires will cause a push to strengthen utility distribution systems against catastrophic damage. Distribution systems may also require upgrades to accommodate additional distributed energy resources and increased electrification. We expect to see an increase in the distribution market opportunities during the rest of 2024.

 Although our C I bidding opportunities remain strong, we may see impacts due to continued market disruptions and overall market volatility which could result in slower growth of our C I segment. We believe that the primary markets we serve such as transportation, data centers, health care, clean energy and warehousing, may be somewhat less vulnerable to an economic slowdown. 
 In addition, the United States has experienced decades of underfunded economic expansion and aging infrastructure that have challenged the capacity of public water and transportation infrastructure forcing states and municipalities to seek creative means to fund needed expansion and repair. We believe the need for expanding public infrastructure in both the United States and Canada will offer opportunity in our C I segment for several years. Legislation and regulation that promotes domestic manufacturing could also create opportunity for our C I segment. We expect the long-term growth in our C I segment to generally track the overall growth of the regions we serve. 
 We continue to implement strategies that are designed to further expand our capabilities and effectively allocate capital. We have maintained a strong balance sheet, while also supporting our organic growth with capital expenditures and working capital and repurchasing our shares. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 643,549 shares of its common stock under our repurchase program at a weighted-average price of 116.54 per share, exhausting substantially all of the authorized funds under our share repurchase program. We believe the borrowing availability under our 490 million revolving credit facility and future cash flow from operations will enable us to support the organic growth of our business, pursue acquisitions and opportunistically repurchase shares. 
 We continue to manage our increasing operating costs, including increasing insurance, equipment, labor and material costs. We believe that our financial position, positive cash flows and other operational strengths will enable us to respond to challenges and uncertainties in the markets we serve and give us the flexibility to successfully execute our strategy. We continue to invest in developing key management and craft personnel in both our T D and C I segments and in procuring the specific specialty equipment and tooling needed to win and execute projects of all sizes and complexity. 
 
 Backlog 
 We refer to our estimated revenue on uncompleted contracts, including the amount of revenue on contracts for which work has not begun, less the revenue we have recognized under such contracts, as backlog. A customer s intention to award us work under a fixed-price contract is not included in backlog unless there is an actual written award to perform a specific scope of work at specific terms and pricing. For many of our unit-price, time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost plus contracts, we only include projected revenue for a three-month period in the calculation of backlog, although these types of contracts are generally awarded as part of master service agreements that typically have a one-year to three-year duration from execution. Backlog may not accurately represent the revenues that we expect to realize during any particular period. Several factors, such as the timing of contract awards, the type and duration of contracts, and the mix of subcontractor and material costs in our projects, can impact our backlog at any point in time. Some of our revenue does not appear in our periodic backlog reporting because the award of the project, as well as the execution of the work, may all take place within the period. Our backlog includes projects that have a written award, a letter of intent, a notice to proceed or an agreed upon work order to perform work on mutually accepted terms and conditions. Backlog should not be relied upon as a stand-alone indicator of future events. 
 The difference between our backlog and remaining performance obligations is due to the exclusion of a portion of our master service agreements under certain contract types from our remaining performance obligations as these contracts can be canceled for convenience at any time by us or the customer without considerable cost incurred by the customer. Our estimated backlog also includes our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture contracts. Additional information related to our remaining performance obligations is provided in Note 6 Revenue Recognition in the accompanying notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Our backlog was 2.60 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 2.51 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2.62 billion at September 30, 2023. Our backlog at September 30, 2024 increased 54.4 million from June 30, 2024. Backlog in the T D segment decreased 32.0 million and C I backlog increased 86.3 million compared to June 30, 2024. Our backlog as of September 30, 2024 included our proportionate share of joint venture backlog totaling 186.2 million, compared to 188.7 million at June 30, 2024.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues. Revenues decreased 51.5 million or 5.5 , to 888.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 939.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 81.0 million in revenue on transmission projects, offset by an increase of 15.3 million in C I revenue, and an increase of 14.3 million in revenue on distribution projects. 
 Gross margin. Gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 8.7 compared to 9.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross margin was primarily impacted by significant changes in our estimated gross profit on certain projects resulting in a net gross margin decrease of 3.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net decrease of 1.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, significant estimate changes negatively impacted gross margin by 4.7 , primarily related to clean energy projects in T D, the unfavorable impact of a C I project, as well as an increase in costs associated with unfavorable job closeouts, and labor and project inefficiencies. In addition, significant estimate changes in gross profit positively impacted gross margin by 0.8 and largely related to better-than-anticipated productivity and a favorable change order.

 Gross profit. Gross profit was 77.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 92.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 15.1 million, or 16.3 , was due to lower margin and lower revenues. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A were 57.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 59.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The period-over-period decrease of 2.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in employee incentive compensation costs and a decrease of 1.1 million of contingent compensation expense related to a prior acquisition, partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses to support future growth. 
 Gain on sale of property and equipment . Gains from the sale of property and equipment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.8 million compared to 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gains from the sale of property and equipment are attributable to routine sales of property and equipment no longer useful or valuable to our ongoing operations. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense was 2.0 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was attributable to higher average outstanding debt balances during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income tax expense. Income tax expense was 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, with an effective tax rate of 42.5 , compared to the expense of 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, with an effective tax rate of 30.3 . The increase in the tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher permanent difference items mostly related to deductibility limits of contingent compensation, associated with a prior acquisition, which was successfully achieved during the third quarter of 2024, as well as higher U.S. taxes on Canadian income. 
 Net income. Net income was 10.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 21.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the reasons stated earlier.

 Operating income for our T D segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.6 million, a decrease of 18.7 million, or 51.6 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, operating income for our T D segment was 3.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to operating income of 6.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating income margin was impacted by significant changes in our estimated gross profit on certain projects resulting in a net operating income margin decrease of 5.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net decrease of 1.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, significant estimated gross profit changes negatively impacted operating income as a percentage of revenues by 5.8 with 5.5 of the impact related to losses on certain clean energy projects. Losses on these projects were primarily related to unfavorable weather conditions, labor and project inefficiencies, higher labor and contract related costs and contractual disputes. In addition, schedule extensions caused by owner-furnished panel delays led to increased costs on two clean energy projects. Many of these projects have reached mechanical completion and the remaining projects are anticipated to reach mechanical completion in the fourth quarter of 2024. Significant estimated gross profit changes were also negatively impacted by an unfavorable job closeout. These decreases were partially offset by positive significant estimated gross profit changes totaling 0.8 and largely related to better-than-anticipated productivity. Additionally, T D operating income margin was negatively impacted by a decrease in work in progress. 
 Commercial Industrial 
 Revenues for our C I segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 406.2 million compared to 390.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 15.3 million, or 3.9 . The increase in revenue was related to an increase of 11.6 million in revenue on fixed priced contracts, an increase of 6.8 million on T E contracts, offset by a decrease of 3.1 million in revenues on unit price work. 
 Operating income for our C I segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.3 million, an increase of 6.4 million, over the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, operating income for our C I segment was 5.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating income margin was positively impacted during the three months ended September 30, 2024, by the continued benefit of higher margins on certain projects nearing completion, due to better-than-anticipated productivity and previous favorable change orders. Operating income margin was also impacted by significant changes in our estimated gross profit on certain projects resulting in a net operating income margin decrease of 2.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net decrease of 0.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Significant estimated gross profit changes negatively impacted operating income as a percentage of revenues by 3.5 , with 2.9 of the impact from a single project that is anticipated to reach substantial completion during the fourth quarter of 2024. The loss from this project was primarily due to scope additions, increased labor costs related to schedule compression and lower productivity due to access and workflow issues. Significant estimated gross profit changes were also negatively impacted by an unfavorable job closeout and labor and project inefficiencies. These decreases were partially offset by positive significant estimated gross profit changes totaling 0.9 and largely related to better-than-anticipated productivity and favorable change orders. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues. Revenues decreased 107.2 million or 4.1 , to 2.53 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.64 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 105.0 million in revenue on transmission projects and a decrease of 40.1 million in C I revenue, partially offset by an increase of 37.8 million in revenue on distribution projects. 
 Gross margin. Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 8.1 compared to 10.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross margin was primarily impacted by significant changes in our estimated gross profit on certain projects resulting in a net gross margin decrease of 4.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net decrease of 1.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, significant estimate changes negatively impacted gross margin by 5.7 , primarily related to clean energy projects in T D, the unfavorable impact of a C I project, labor and project inefficiencies, an increase in costs associated with schedule compression on certain projects, an unfavorable change order and an unfavorable job closeout. In addition, significant estimate changes in gross profit positively impacted gross margin by 1.3 and mainly related to better-than-anticipated productivity, favorable change orders and favorable job closeouts. Gross margin also benefited by approximately 0.2 from favorable joint venture results during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Gross profit. Gross profit was 204.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 266.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 62.5 million, or 23.4 was due to lower margin and lower revenues. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG A was 181.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 174.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The period-over-period increase of 6.9 million was primarily due to an increase of 4.2 million of contingent compensation expense related to a prior acquisition and an increase in employee-related expenses to support future growth, partially offset by a decrease in employee incentive compensation costs. 
 Gain on sale of property and equipment. Gains from the sale of property and equipment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.7 million compared to 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gains from the sale of property and equipment are attributable to routine sales of property and equipment no longer useful or valuable to our ongoing operations. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense was 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Revenues for our T D segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.43 billion compared to 1.50 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 67.2 million. The decrease in revenue was related to a decrease of 105.0 million in revenue on transmission projects, offset by an increase of 37.8 million in revenue on distribution projects. Revenues from transmission projects represented 61.0 and 65.3 of T D segment revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Operating income for our T D segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 39.1 million, a decrease of 67.7 million, or 63.4 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, operating income for our T D segment was 2.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating income margin was impacted by significant changes in our estimated gross profit on certain projects resulting in a net operating income margin decrease of 6.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net decrease of 1.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, significant estimated gross profit changes negatively impacted operating income as a percentage of revenues by 6.3 with 6.1 of the impact related to losses on certain clean energy projects. Losses on these projects were primarily related to contractual disputes, labor and project inefficiencies, higher labor and contract related costs and unfavorable weather conditions. In addition, schedule extensions caused by owner-furnished panel delays led to increased costs on two clean energy projects. Many of these projects have reached mechanical completion and the remaining projects are anticipated to reach mechanical completion in the fourth quarter of 2024. Significant estimated gross profit changes were also negatively impacted by an unfavorable job closeout and labor and project inefficiencies. These decreases were partially offset by positive significant estimated gross profit changes totaling 0.3 of revenues mostly related to better-than-anticipated productivity. Additionally, T D operating income margin was negatively impacted by higher fleet depreciation and maintenance expenses. 
 Commercial Industrial 
 Revenues for our C I segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.10 billion compared to 1.14 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 40.1 million, or 3.5 , which was primarily due to the delayed start of certain projects in 2024. The decrease in revenue was related to a decrease of 36.0 million in revenue on fixed priced contracts and a decrease of 9.1 million in revenues on unit price work, offset by an increase of 5.0 million on T E contracts. 
 Operating income for our C I segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 33.3 million, a decrease of 3.9 million, over the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, operating income for our C I segment was 3.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating income margin was impacted by significant changes in our estimated gross profit on certain projects resulting in a net operating income margin decrease of 2.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net decrease of 1.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Significant estimated gross profit changes negatively impacted operating income as a percentage of revenues by 5.1 with 2.3 of the impact from a single project that is anticipated to reach substantial completion during the fourth quarter of 2024. The loss from this project was primarily due to scope additions, increased labor costs related to schedule compression and lower productivity due to access and workflow issues. Significant estimated gross profit changes were also negatively impacted by an increase in costs associated with labor and project inefficiencies, schedule compression on certain projects and an unfavorable change order. These decreases were partially offset by positive significant estimated gross profit changes totaling 2.7 and largely related to better-than-anticipated productivity, some of which related to clean energy projects, favorable change orders and favorable job closeouts. Additionally, C I operating income margin was positively impacted by approximately 0.5 due to favorable joint venture results. This increase was partially offset by higher contingent compensation expense related to a prior acquisition, a decrease in work in progress and higher fleet depreciation and maintenance expenses. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measure EBITDA 
 We define EBITDA, a performance measure used by management, as net income plus interest expense net of interest income, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to net cash flows provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our Consolidated Financial Statements in evaluating our operating performance and cash flow because EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, useful lives placed on assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies. We use, and we believe investors benefit from, the presentation of EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with an additional tool to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 Using EBITDA as a performance measure has material limitations as compared to net income, or other financial measures as defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), as it excludes certain recurring items, which may be meaningful to investors. EBITDA excludes interest expense net of interest income; however, as we have borrowed money to finance transactions and operations, or invested available cash to generate interest income, interest expense and interest income are elements of our cost structure and can affect our ability to generate revenue and returns for our shareholders. Further, EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization; however, as we use capital and intangible assets to generate revenues, depreciation and amortization are a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue. Finally, EBITDA excludes income taxes; however, as we are organized as a corporation, the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our operations. As a result of these exclusions from EBITDA, any measure that excludes interest expense net of interest income, depreciation and amortization and income taxes has material limitations as compared to net income. When using EBITDA as a performance measure, management compensates for these limitations by comparing EBITDA to net income in each period, to allow for the comparison of the performance of the underlying core operations with the overall performance of the company on a full-cost, after-tax basis. Using both EBITDA and net income to evaluate the business allows management and investors to (a) assess our relative performance against our competitors and (b) monitor our capacity to generate returns for our shareholders. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income 10,649 21,512 14,311 66,948 Add: Interest expense, net 1,943 1,093 4,015 2,319 Income tax expense 7,881 9,331 5,178 22,563 Depreciation amortization 16,693 15,039 48,797 43,534 EBITDA 37,166 46,975 72,301 135,364 
 We also use EBITDA as a liquidity measure. Certain material covenants contained within our credit agreement (the Credit Agreement are based on EBITDA with certain additional adjustments. Non-compliance with these financial covenants under the Credit Agreement our interest coverage ratio which is defined in the Credit Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) divided by interest expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and our net leverage ratio, which is defined in the Credit Agreement as Total Net Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement), divided by Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) could result in our lenders requiring us to immediately repay all amounts borrowed on our revolving credit facility. If we anticipated a potential covenant violation, we would seek relief from our lenders, likely causing us to incur additional cost, and such relief might not be available, or if available, might not be on terms as favorable as those in the Credit Agreement. In addition, if we cannot satisfy these financial covenants, we would be prohibited under the Credit Agreement from engaging in certain activities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, making certain payments, and acquiring or disposing of assets. Based on the information above, management believes that the presentation of EBITDA as a liquidity measure is useful to investors and relevant to their assessment of our capacity to service or incur debt, fund capital expenditures, finance acquisitions and expand our operations.

 The following table provides a reconciliation of net cash flows provided by operating activities to EBITDA:

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Material Cash Requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 269.2 million. We define working capital as current assets less current liabilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities of our business provided net cash of 66.0 million, compared to 28.4 million of cash provided for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by operating margins, timing of contract performance and the type of services we provide to our customers. The 37.6 million year-over-year increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to favorable net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 86.5 million, offset by a decrease of 52.6 million in net income. The favorable change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the net favorable year-over-year changes in various working capital accounts that relate primarily to construction activities (accounts receivable, contract assets, accounts payable and contract liabilities) of 79.6 million and the favorable change of 9.4 million in other liabilities. The net favorable changes of 79.6 million in cash provided by working capital accounts, mainly related to construction activities, was due to the timing of billings and payments under our contracts. The favorable change of 9.4 million in other liabilities was primarily due to the timing of employee related wage and tax payments. 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used net cash of 56.8 million in investing activities consisting of 63.6 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by 6.8 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities used net cash of 26.0 million, consisting primarily of 75.0 million of share repurchases under our share repurchase program, 7.0 million of payments under our equipment notes and 5.9 million of shares repurchased to satisfy tax obligations under our stock compensation programs, partially offset by 64.0 million of net borrowings under our revolving line of credit. 
 We believe our 375.5 million borrowing availability under our revolving line of credit as of September 30, 2024, future cash flow from operations and our ability to utilize short-term and long-term leases will provide sufficient liquidity for our short-term and long-term needs. Our primary short-term liquidity needs include cash for operations, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, and acquisition and joint venture opportunities. We believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our long-term liquidity needs and foreseeable material cash requirements, including those associated with funding future acquisition opportunities. We continue to invest in developing key management and craft personnel in both our T D and C I segments and in procuring the specific specialty equipment and tooling needed to win and execute projects of all sizes and complexity. 
 We have not historically paid dividends and currently do not expect to pay dividends.

 Debt Instruments 
 Credit Agreement 
 On May 31, 2023, the Company entered into a five-year third amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. that provides for a 490 million revolving credit facility (the Facility ), subject to certain financial covenants as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Facility allows for revolving loans in Canadian dollars and other non-US currencies, up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of 150 million. Up to 75 million of the Facility may be used for letters of credit, with an additional 75 million available for letters of credit, subject to the sole discretion of each issuing bank. The Facility also allows for 15 million to be used for swingline loans. The Company has an expansion option to increase the commitments under the Facility or enter into incremental term loans, subject to certain conditions, by up to an additional 200 million upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Subject to certain exceptions, the Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries, and by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of the Company s domestic subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of the direct foreign subsidiaries of the Company. Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the Company s domestic subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the Facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and payable. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are used to refinance existing indebtedness, and to provide for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. 
 Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company s option, at a rate equal to either (1) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25 to 1.00 ; or (2) the Term Benchmark Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25 to 2.00 . The applicable margin is determined based on the Company s Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Letters of credit issued under the Facility are subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.25 to 2.00 for non-performance letters of credit or 0.625 to 1.00 for performance letters of credit, based on the Company s Net Leverage Ratio. The Company is subject to a commitment fee of 0.20 to 0.30 , based on the Company s Net Leverage Ratio, on any unused portion of the Facility. The Credit Agreement restricts certain types of payments when the Company s Net Leverage Ratio, after giving pro forma effect thereto, exceeds 2.75. 
 Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is subject to certain financial covenants including a maximum Net Leverage Ratio of 3.0 and a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 3.0. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants including limitations on asset sales, investments, indebtedness and liens. The Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 
 We had 77.2 million and 13.2 million of borrowings outstanding under the Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Letters of Credit 
 Some of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf, such as to beneficiaries under our insurance programs. In addition, from time to time, certain customers require us to post letters of credit to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to guarantee performance under our contracts. Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution. The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder claims that we have failed to perform specified actions in accordance with the terms of the letter of credit. If this were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. Currently, we do not believe it is likely that any claims will be made under any letter of credit. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 37.3 million in letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Agreement, including 32.6 million related to the Company's payment obligation under its insurance programs and 4.7 million related to contract performance obligations. As of December 31, 2023, we had 34.4 million in letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Agreement, including 27.1 million related to the Company's payment obligations under its insurance programs and 7.3 million related to contract performance obligations.

 Equipment Notes 
 We have entered into multiple Master Loan Agreements with multiple finance companies. The Master Loan Agreements may be used for financing of equipment between us and the lenders pursuant to one or more equipment notes ("Equipment Notes"). Each Equipment Note constitutes a separate, distinct and independent financing of equipment and contractual obligation. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had one outstanding Equipment Note collateralized by equipment and vehicles owned by us. As of December 31, 2023, we had two outstanding Equipment Notes collateralized by equipment and vehicles owned by us. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we also had one other equipment note outstanding collateralized by a vehicle owned by us. The outstanding balance of all equipment notes was 16.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and 23.0 million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding short-term and long-term equipment notes of approximately 4.4 million and 11.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding short-term and long-term equipment notes of approximately 7.1 million and 16.0 million, respectively. 
 Lease Obligations 
 From time to time, the Company enters into non-cancelable leases for some of our facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow the Company to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for the use of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them. The Company s leases have remaining terms ranging from one to nine years, some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to ten years, and some of which may include options to terminate the leases within one year. Typically, the Company has purchase options on the equipment underlying its long-term leases and many of its short-term rental arrangements. The Company may exercise some of these purchase options when the need for equipment is on-going and the purchase option price is attractive. 
 The outstanding balance of operating lease obligations was 40.6 million as of September 30, 2024, consisting of short-term and long-term operating lease obligations of approximately 11.1 million and 29.5 million, respectively. The outstanding balance of operating lease obligations was 35.0 million as of December 31, 2023, consisting of short-term and long-term operating lease obligations of approximately 9.2 million and 25.8 million, respectively. 
 The outstanding balance of finance lease obligations was 3.5 million as of September 30, 2024, consisting of short-term and long-term finance lease obligations of approximately 1.2 million and 2.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 we had 2.3 million outstanding finance lease obligations, consisting of short-term and long-term finance lease obligations of approximately 2.0 million and 0.3 million, respectively. 
 Purchase Commitments for Construction Equipment 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 5.5 million in outstanding purchase obligations for certain construction equipment to be paid with cash outlays scheduled to occur in 2024 and 2025. 
 Performance and Payment Bonds and Parent Guarantees 
 Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse our sureties for any expenses or outlays they incur. Under our continuing indemnity and security agreements with the issuers of the bonds, we may be required to grant them a security interest relating to a particular project. We believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund significant claims under our surety arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, an aggregate of approximately 2.83 billion in original face amount of bonds issued by our sureties were outstanding. Our estimated remaining cost to complete these bonded projects was approximately 741.6 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 From time to time, we guarantee the obligations of our wholly owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease agreements, and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors licenses. Additionally, from time to time, we are required to post letters of credit to guarantee the obligations of our wholly owned subsidiaries, which reduces the borrowing availability under our credit facility.

 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 We grant trade credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include high credit quality electric utilities, governmental entities, general contractors and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located in the United States and Canada. Consequently, we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the United States and Canada. However, we generally have certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Under certain circumstances such as foreclosures or negotiated settlements, we may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, none of our customers individually exceeded 10 of consolidated accounts receivable. Management believes the terms and conditions in its contracts, billing and collection policies are adequate to minimize the potential credit risk.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We have operations within the United States and Canada, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effects of fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were not party to any derivative instruments. We did not use any material derivative financial instruments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, including instruments for trading, hedging, or speculating on changes in interest rates, changes in foreign currency rates or changes in commodity prices of materials used in our business. 
 Any borrowings under our Facility are based upon interest rates that will vary depending upon the prime rate, Canadian prime rate, the NYFRB overnight bank funding rate, Term CORRA, and Term SOFR Reference Rate. If the prime rate, Canadian prime rate, the NYFRB overnight bank funding rate, Term CORRA, or Term SOFR Reference Rate rises, any interest payment obligations would increase and have a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition. We currently do not maintain any hedging contracts that would limit our exposure to variable rates of interest when we have outstanding borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, we had 77.2 million of borrowings outstanding under the Facility. If market rates of interest on all our revolving debt as of September 30, 2024, which is subject to variable rates, permanently increased by 1 , the increase in interest expense on all revolving debt would decrease future income before provision for income taxes and cash flows by approximately 0.8 million annually. If market rates of interest on all our revolving debt, which is subject to variable rates as of September 30, 2024, permanently decreased by 1 , the decrease in interest expense on all debt would increase future income before provision for income taxes and cash flows by approximately 0.8 million annually. Borrowings under our equipment notes are at fixed rates established on the date the respective equipment note was executed.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 We face a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, employees, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A discussion of our risk factors can be found in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. As of the date of this filing, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. An investment in our common stock involves various risks. When considering an investment in the Company, you should carefully consider all of the risk factors described in our 2023 Annual Report. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us and there may be additional matters that are not known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. These risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our business, employees, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and, thus, the value of our common stock and any investment in the Company.
