Each Unit consists of Class A Ordinary Share and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (the Public Warrants ), with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase Class A Ordinary Share at per share. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of an aggregate of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant, in a private placement to the Company s sponsor, Graf Global Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Sponsor ), and Cantor Fitzgerald Co., the representative of the underwriters of the initial Public Offering, generating gross proceeds of , which is described in Note 4. Transaction costs amounted to , consisting of of cash underwriting fee, of deferred underwriting fee (see additional discussion in Note 6), and of other offering costs. The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of its Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination (less deferred underwriting commissions). The Company s initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80 of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding any deferred underwriters fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time the Company signs a definitive agreement to enter into an initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.

 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in the trust account (the Trust Account ), with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee and held as cash or invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations., until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. To mitigate the risk that might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, which risk increases the longer that the Company holds investments in the Trust Account, the Company may, at any time in its own discretion, instruct the trustee to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest bearing bank demand deposit account. The Company will provide its holders of the Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem, regardless of whether they abstain, vote for, or against, a Business Combination, all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be 10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering (as discussed in Note 6). All of the Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the initial Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association ). In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and its guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ), paragraph 10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of a company require ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Accordingly, all of the Public Shares were presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of the Company s balance sheets. Given that the Public Shares were issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., public warrants), the initial carrying value of Class A Ordinary Shares classified as temporary equity were the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. The resulting discount to the initial carrying value of temporary equity was accreted upon closing the Initial Public Offering such that the carrying value equals the redemption value on such date. The accretion or remeasurement is recognized as a reduction to retained earnings, or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital. Accretion associated with the redeemable Class A Ordinary Shares is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. The Public Shares are redeemable and were classified as such on the balance sheets until such date that a redemption event takes place. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the holders of the Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) prior to Initial Public Offering (the Initial Shareholders have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. In addition, the Initial Shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of or more of the Public Shares without the prior consent of the Company.

 of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in conjunction with any such amendment. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or during any extended time that the Company has to consummate a business combination beyond 24 months as a result of a shareholder vote to amend the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the Combination Period ), the Company will but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) subject to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. In such event, the warrants will expire and be worthless. In connection with the redemption of 100 of the Company s outstanding Public Shares for a portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the fund held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses). The Initial Shareholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Shareholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Company s Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only 10.00 per share initially held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) 10.00 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than 10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable; provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Liquidity and Going Concern As of September 30, 2024, the Company had in its operating bank account and working capital of . The Company initially has until June 27, 2026 to consummate the initial Business Combination (assume no extensions). If the Company does not complete a Business Combination, the Company will trigger an automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. Notwithstanding management s belief that the Company would have sufficient funds to execute its business strategy, there is a possibility that business combination might not happen within the 24-month period from the date of the auditors report.

As a result, diluted net income (loss) per Ordinary Share is the same as basic net income (loss) per Ordinary Share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

On February 8, 2024, the Sponsor surrendered Founder Shares for consideration, resulting in the Sponsor holding Founder Shares. All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the share capitalization. The holders of the Founder Shares agreed to forfeit and cancel up to an aggregate of Founder Shares, on a pro rata basis, to the extent that the option to purchase additional Units is not exercised in full by the underwriters. The forfeiture will be adjusted to the extent that the option to purchase additional Units is not exercised in full by the underwriters so that the Founder Shares will represent approximately of the Company s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. On June 27, 2024, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full as part of the closing of the Initial Public Offering. As such, the Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. On June 7, 2024, the Sponsor transferred Founder Shares to each of the Company s independent directors, Louis B langer-Martin, Kenneth Weinstein, and Fred Zeidman, for an aggregate of Founder Shares, at a price of per share. Each independent director paid or an aggregate purchase price of in consideration of the assignment of shares. The sale of the Founders Shares to each of the Company s independent directors is in the scope of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ASC 718 ).

The fair value of the shares granted to the Company s independent directors was or per share. The Founder Shares were granted subject to a performance condition (i.e., the occurrence of a Business Combination). Compensation expense related to the Founder Shares is recognized only when the performance condition is probable of occurrence under the applicable accounting literature in this circumstance. As of June 27, 2024, the Company determined that a Business Combination is not considered probable, and, therefore, stock-based compensation expense has been recognized. Stock-based compensation would be recognized at the date a Business Combination is considered probable (i.e., upon consummation of a Business Combination) in an amount equal to the number of Founder Shares times the grant date fair value per share (unless subsequently modified) less the amount initially received for the purchase of the Founder Shares. With certain limited exceptions, the Founder Shares are not transferable, assignable or salable (except to the Company s officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with the Sponsor, each of whom will be subject to the same transfer restrictions) until the earlier to occur of (i) after the completion of the initial Business Combination or (ii) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction after the initial Business Combination that results in all of the shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property; except to certain permitted transferees and under certain circumstances as described herein.

The underwriters were entitled to an underwriting discount of per Unit on Units other than those sold pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional Units, or in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, the underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of per Unit on Units other than those sold pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional Units, and per Unit on Units sold pursuant to the underwriters over-allotment option or in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.

Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, it will use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.

References to our management or our management team refer to our officers and directors, and references to the Sponsor refer to Graf Global Sponsor LLC. The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-Q including, without limitation, statements in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the completion of an initial Business Combination (as defined below), the Company s financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as expect, believe, anticipate, intend, estimate, seek and variations and similar words and expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance, but reflect management s current beliefs, based on information currently available. A number of factors could cause actual events, performance or results to differ materially from the events, performance and results discussed in the forward-looking statements, including that the conditions of an initial Business Combination are not satisfied. For information identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Risk Factors section of the Company s final prospectus for its initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). The Company s securities filings can be accessed on the EDGAR section of the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on November 17, 2021 formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination that the Company has not yet identified. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from November 17, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 2,799,891, which consists of interest income on cash held in the Trust Account of 2,995,098, offset by operating costs of 195,207. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 2,781,073, which consists of interest income on cash held in the Trust Account of 3,093,615, offset by operating costs of 312,542. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had no net income or loss.

Table of Contents 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 45, which consists of operating costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources On June 27, 2024, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 23,000,000 Units, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,000,000 Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 230,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of an aggregate of 6,000,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, in a private placement to the Company s sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 6,000,000. Following the Initial Public Offering, the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the Private Units, a total of 230,000,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred 14,455,519, consisting of 4,000,000 of cash underwriting fee, 9,800,000 of deferred underwriting fee (see additional discussion in Note 6), and 655,519 of other offering costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 827,464. Net loss of 2,781,073 was affected by payment of operation costs through promissory note of 32,151 and interest earned on cash held in the Trust Account of 3,093,615. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used 547,073 of cash for operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 0. Net loss of 45 was affected by payment of operation costs through promissory note of 2,898. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used 2,853 of cash for operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash held in the Trust Account of 233,093,615 (including approximately 3,093,615 of interest income). We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 568,772. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1.5 million of such Working Capital Loans may be converted into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon consummation of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.

 Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor 20,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support services provided to members of the management team. We began incurring these fees on June 25, 2024 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred and paid 60,000 and 64,000 in fees in administrative support services fee, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not incur any payment for these services. The underwriters were entitled to an underwriting discount of 0.20 per Unit on Units other than those sold pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional Units, or 4,000,000 in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, the underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 0.40 per Unit on Units other than those sold pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional Units, and 0.60 per Unit on Units sold pursuant to the underwriters over-allotment option or 9,800,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgement. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financials statements, which management consider in formulating its estimated, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could materially differ from those estimates. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any critical accounting estimates to be disclosed. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level and, accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
