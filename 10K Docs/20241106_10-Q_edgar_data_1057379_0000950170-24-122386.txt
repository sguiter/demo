 and , respectively. In connection with the awards, the annual equity incentive award opportunities for the recipients during the performance period of the awards will be reduced by compared to the annual equity incentive award opportunities in the Company s executive compensation program for 2024. The awards are split into three equal tranches with each tranche having its own market condition and service condition. The market condition is met when the Company s stock price reaches a certain share price hurdle for consecutive trading days during the performance period from the grant date through December 31, 2028. The share price hurdles are , , and for the first, second, and third tranches, respectively. Additionally, the service condition is met if the employee is employed on the first, second, and third anniversary of the grant date for the first tranche, second tranche, and third tranche, respectively. Furthermore, if the second or third tranches are not met during the performance period, and the volume weighted average of the Company s stock price falls between two share price hurdles for over consecutive trading days immediately prior to the end of the performance period, the employee will vest in an interpolated amount of the next tranche. The Company used a lattice valuation model to determine the fair value of the three tranches as of the grant date. The lattice valuation model, using different share price paths, calculates a derived service period which is the median share price path on which the market condition is satisfied for each tranche. The requisite service period was determined to be service conditions as the service conditions are greater than the derived service period. For each of the three tranches, stock compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as incurred. If an employee forfeits nonvested shares subsequent to meeting a service condition, the previously recognized expense is not reversed. If an employee forfeits nonvested shares prior to meeting the service condition, the previously recognized expense is reversed. As of September 27, 2024, these market conditions had not been met and as such these shares had not vested and were not included in the Company's basic or dilutive shares outstanding. The stock price appreciation equity program non-cash stock compensation expense was million for both the quarter and nine months ended September 27, 2024. As of September 27, 2024, there was million of total unrecognized non-cash stock based compensation expense which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years.

Revenue . We are a global Company with operations in our primary markets located in the United States and Western Europe. Our revenue is denominated in multiple currencies, primarily the U.S. Dollar, British Pound and Euro, and as a result is affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. The impact of currency fluctuations did not have a significant impact on comparisons between the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and the same comparable periods of 2023. In this MD A, we discuss revenue based on geographical location of engagement team personnel. 
 
 Our Company total revenue was 79.8 million and 234.6 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 75.9 million and 224.2 million in the same periods in 2023, respectively. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, one customer accounted for 13 and 12 , respectively, of our total revenue. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, one customer accounted for 6 and 5 , respectively, of our total revenue. 
 
 Segment revenue. The Company has three reportable segments: Global Strategy Business Transformation (Global S BT), Oracle Solutions and SAP Solutions. Global S BT includes S BT Gen A.I. and Business Transformation Consulting, Benchmarking, Business Advisory Services, Intellectual Property as-a-Service (IPASS) and OneStream offerings. Oracle Solutions and SAP Solutions support the two fundamentally distinct ERP systems: Oracle and SAP.

Global S BT total revenue was 44.1 million and 127.2 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 43.8 million and 129.8 million in the same periods of 2023, respectively. The revenue growth in our Gen A.I. consulting and implementation offerings were offset by weakness in our e-procurement implementation offerings. 
 Oracle Solutions total revenue was 22.8 million and 67.5 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 20.8 million and 58.8 million in the same periods of 2023, respectively. The segment has continued the momentum it has experienced since the second quarter of 2023. 
 SAP Solutions total revenue was 13.0 million and 40.0 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 11.2 million and 35.6 million in the same periods of 2023, respectively. The increase in revenue during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was due to the strong software-related sales during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. 
 Reimbursements as a percentage of Company total revenue were 2 during both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023. Reimbursements are project travel-related expenses passed through to a client with no associated operating margin. 
 Cost of Service. Cost of service consists of personnel costs before reimbursable expenses, which includes salaries, benefits and incentive compensation for consultants and subcontractor fees, acquisition-related non-cash stock based compensation expense and non-cash stock based compensation expense, and reimbursable expenses which are travel and other expenses passed through to a client and are associated with projects. 
 Personnel costs before reimbursable expenses were 46.4 million and 137.6 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 44.4 million and 133.0 million in the same periods of 2023, respectively. The higher costs in the first nine months of 2024 were primarily a result of increased salaries, higher utilization of subcontractors and increases in non-cash stock compensation expense. Personnel costs as a percentage of total Company total revenue were 58 and 59 during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and 59 for each of the same periods in 2023, respectively. 
 Non-cash stock based compensation expense, included in personnel costs before reimbursable expenses was 2.1 million and 5.2 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 1.5 million and 4.7 million in the same periods of 2023, respectively. This increase was primarily related to increased non-cash stock compensation from the stock price appreciation equity program issuances (Note 7) and to the acquisition related non-cash stock compensation expense (Note 1 and Note 7). 
 Selling, General and Administrative Costs SG A . SG A primarily consists of salaries, benefits and incentive compensation for the selling, marketing, administrative and executive employees, non-cash stock based compensation expense and various other overhead expenses. 
 SG A costs increased 14 , to 18.7 million, and 12 , to 55.0 million, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 16.5 million and 49.3 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. This increase in the costs during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to the incremental investments we have made in sales and related expenses, increased commissions, increased incentive compensation commensurate with Company performance, increased non-cash stock based compensation, as well as foreign currency fluctuations. SG A costs as a percentage of total Company revenue were 23 during both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 22 during the same periods in 2023. 
 Non-cash stock based compensation expense, included in SG A, was 1.7 million and 4.1 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 1.2 million and 3.2 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. The increase in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 primarily relates to the non-cash stock compensation expense from the stock price appreciation equity program issuances (Note 7) . 
 Segment Profit. Segment profit consists of the revenue generated by the segment, less the direct costs of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses that are incurred directly by the segment. Items not allocated to the segment level include corporate costs related to the administrative functions that are performed in a centralized manner and that are not attributable to a particular segment. These administrative function costs include corporate general and administrative expenses, non-cash compensation, depreciation expense, interest expense and legal settlement and related costs. 
 22 

Global S BT segment profit was 14.1 million and 37.0 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 14.0 million and 40.9 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. This decrease in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to the revenue growth in our Gen A.I. consulting and implementation offerings more than offset by weakness in our e-procurement implementation offerings. 
 Oracle Solutions segment profit was 5.5 million and 16.2 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 5.0 million and 14.0 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. The increase during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by increased headcount and increased usage of subcontractors. 
 SAP Solutions segment profit was 3.7 million and 11.8 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 2.9 million and 8.5 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. The increase in segment profit in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to the value-added reseller activity in the quarter, partially offset by higher commissions and sales related costs. 
 
 Legal Settlement and Related Costs. In May 2023, Gartner, Inc. ("Gartner") filed a lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction and damages against the Company and two ex-Gartner employees that were hired by us. On February 17, 2024, we, Gartner and the two ex-Gartner employees entered into a settlement agreement whereby we made a settlement payment of 985,000 to Gartner in exchange for a dismissal of the lawsuit and a release of all claims which is reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 29, 2023. In addition, we incurred incremental legal costs related to the settlement which were recorded as expense in the period incurred. 
 Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net was 0.4 million and 1.4 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 0.8 million and 2.6 million in the same periods in 2023, respectively. As of September 27, 2024, we had outstanding debt of 20.0 million, excluding debt issue costs. As of September 29, 2023, we had outstanding debt of 44.0 million, excluding debt issue costs. 
 Income Taxes. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, we recorded 3.8 million and 9.4 million of income tax expense, respectively, related to certain federal, foreign and state taxes which reflected an effective tax rate of 30.9 and 26.6 , respectively. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, we recorded 3.5 million and 8.9 million of income tax expense, respectively, related to certain federal, foreign and state taxes which reflected an effective tax rate of 27.1 and 25.3 , respectively. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 27, 2024 and December 29, 2023, we had 9.7 million and 21.0 million, respectively, classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets. We currently believe that available funds (including the cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under our revolving line of credit the "Credit Facility") and cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, including debt payments, lease obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months and beyond. We may decide to raise additional funds in order to fund expansion, to develop new or further enhance products and services, to respond to competitive pressures, or to acquire complementary businesses or technologies. There is no assurance that additional financing would be available when needed or desired. Our cash requirements have not changed materially from those disclosed in Item 7 included in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2023. 
 The following table summarizes our cash flow activity (in thousands):

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 27.1 million during the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 11.8 million during the same period in 2023. In 2024 and 2023, the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and contract assets, decreases in accrued liabilities and other accruals primarily due to payments of the prior year earned incentive compensation liabilities and payments to vendors. 
 23 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 9.6 million during the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 3.2 million during the same period in 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company acquired LeewayHertz for 6.5 million, net of cash acquired (see Note 1). During both the first nine months periods of 2024 and 2023, cash flows used in investing activities also included investments made to the continued development of our Hackett Connect Executive Advisory member platform, our QL benchmark, Digital Transformation technologies and our Gen A.I. platform, A.I. XPLR. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 28.4 million and 29.0 million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The usage of cash in 2024, primarily related to the repayment of borrowings of 13.0 million related to our Credit Facility, dividend payments of 9.1 million and the repurchase of 6.9 million of the Company's common stock. The usage of cash in 2023 primarily related to the net repayment of borrowings of 21.0 million related to our Credit Facility, dividend payments of 9.0 million and the repurchase of 4.4 million of the Company's common stock. 
 As of September 27, 2024, we had 20.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility, excluding deferred debt costs, leaving us with a capacity of approximately 80.0 million. 
 24 

Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 As of September 27, 2024, our exposure to market risk related primarily to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate risks. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Credit Facility, which is subject to variable interest rates. Under our credit agreement, the interest rates per annum applicable to loans under the Credit Facility was, at our option, equal to a base rate for one-, two-, three- or nine-month interest periods chosen by us in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage. A 100-basis point increase in our interest rate under our Credit Facility would not have had a material impact on our results of operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 27, 2024. 
 Exchange Rate Sensitivity 
 We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a portion of our revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the British Pound, the Euro and the Australian Dollar. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Item 5.	Other Information. 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements 
 During the three months ended September 27, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
