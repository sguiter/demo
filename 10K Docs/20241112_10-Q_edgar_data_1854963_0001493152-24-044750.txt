and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 respectively, were moved from Interest Expense to Change
in the Fair Value of Deferred Consideration . Corresponding adjustments have been made to the statement of cash flows and the applicable
notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SHF Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries where the Company have controlling
financial interests. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the instructions to Form 10-Q. 

of the total loan balance. The Company
also indemnified twenty-four loans as of September 30, 2024; of which three of these indemnified loans were in excess of of the total
balance. 

in cash and net working capital deficit of , as compared to in
cash and net working capital deficit of as of December 31, 2023. The retained deficit was on September 30, 2024,
and on December 31, 2023. The Company has also generated operating income of and for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024 respectively. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported positive operating income. However, considering the historical data, where
the Company experienced negative operating income and negative net working capital, management acknowledges the need to closely evaluate
the financial performance in upcoming quarters to mitigate any going concern risks. As of September 30, 2024, due to these historical
trends, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the
date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. 

If
the Company is not able to sustain its present level of operations, it may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms
with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, or suspend or curtail planned expansion programs. Any of these actions could materially
harm the Company s business, results of operations and future prospects. 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or amounts and classification
of liabilities that may result should the Company not continue as a going concern as a result of this uncertainty.

Troubled
Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 

This
Accounting Standard Update (ASU 2022-02) eliminates the recognition and measurement guidance on troubled debt restructurings for creditors
that have adopted ASC 326 and requires them to make enhanced disclosures about loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty. The new guidance also requires public business entities to present current period gross write-offs (on a current year-to-date
basis for interim-period disclosures) by year of origination in their vintage disclosures. For entities that have adopted ASU 2016-13,
this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
has adopted this standard as of January 1, 2023 and the ASU has not had a material impact on the Company s unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements. 

Fair
Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions 

This
Accounting Standard Update (ASU 2022-03) clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered
part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered when measuring fair value. Recognizing a contractual
restriction on the sale of an equity security as a separate unit of account is not permitted. This ASU is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has adopted this standard as of January
1, 2024 and the ASU has not had a material impact on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Reference
Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 

This
Accounting Standard Update (ASU 2022-06) defers the Sunset Date of ASC Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which provides temporary
optional relief in accounting for the impact of Reference Rate Reform. This ASU is effective upon issuance (December 21, 2022) and generally
can be applied through December 31, 2024. This ASU has not had a material impact on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

Investments-Equity
Method and Joint Ventures 

In
March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax
Credit Structures using the Proportional Amortization Method. The FASB issued final guidance allowing entities to apply the proportional
amortization method to equity investments in all tax credit programs that meet the conditions in ASC 323-740, rather than just investments
in qualified affordable projects that generate low income housing tax credits, as was required under the legacy guidance. The guidance
is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within those fiscal
years. This ASU has not had a material impact on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Standards
Pending to be Adopted 

Business
Combinations-Joint Venture Formations 

In
August 2023, the FASB issued 2023-05, Business Combinations-Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60); Recognition and Initial Measurement.
This ASU contains guidance requiring certain joint ventures to apply a new basis of accounting upon formation by recognizing and initially
measuring most of their assets and liabilities at fair value. This guidance is effective for all joint venture formations with a formation
date on or after January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. Joint Ventures formed before the effective date have the option to apply
it retrospectively, while those formed after the effective date are required to apply it prospectively. The Company does not expect this
ASU to have a material impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Disclosure
Improvements, Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. 

In
October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements, Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC s Disclosure
Update and Simplification Initiative . This ASU amends the disclosure or presentation requirements related to various subtopics
in the FASB codification. 

The
effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or
Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. For all other entities, the amendments will be effective two years
later. The amendments in this Update should be applied prospectively. For all entities, if by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed
the applicable requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the
codification and will not become effective for any entity. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Segment
Reporting 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). This ASU requires public entities to provide disclosures of
significant segment expenses and other segment items. It also requires public entities to provide in interim periods all disclosures
about a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Public entities with a single reportable
segment will have to provide all the disclosures required by ASC 280, including the significant segment expense disclosures. This guidance
is applied retrospectively to all periods presented, unless it is impractical. This ASU applies to all public entities and is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Income
Taxes 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740). This ASU requires public business entities to disclose in their
rate reconciliation table additional categories of information about income taxes paid, including certain disclosures that would be disaggregated
by jurisdiction and other categories. This ASU is effective for fiscal years after December 15, 2024. Early adoption would be permitted.
The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

ASU
2024-01: Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards 

ASU
2024-01 clarifies the scope applications of profits interest awards by adding illustrative guidance to ASC 718 Compensation-Stock
Compensation. The amendments in the ASU apply to all reporting entities that account for profits interest awards as compensation
to employees or non-employees in return for goods or services. 

The
term profits interest is not explicitly defined in U.S. GAAP. Rather, an IRS Revenue Procedure (Rev Proc 93-27) defines
a Profits Interest as a partnership interest other than a capital interest. Unlike a capital interest, which
provides rights to existing net assets of an entity, a profits interest only provides rights to future profits and/or equity appreciation
of an entity. This distinction, along with other terms, conditions and characteristics of profits interests often complicates accounting
decisions for profits interests, leading to diversity in practice whether to account for profits interests under ASC 718 or other U.S.
GAAP. 

The
ASU introduces four (4) illustrative examples of fact patterns that demonstrate how an entity would apply the scope guidance in paragraph
718-10-15-3 to a profits interest or similar award with certain features. 

The
ASUs are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those years.
For all other entities, adoption is required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

ASU
2024-02: Codification Improvements Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements 

The
ASU contains amendments to the Codification that remove references to various FASB Concepts Statements. The FASB has a standing project
on its agenda to address suggestions received from stakeholders on the Accounting Standards Codification and other incremental improvements
to U.S. GAAP. This effort facilitates Codification updates for technical corrections such as conforming amendments, clarifications to
guidance, simplifications to wording or the structure of guidance and other minor improvements. In the Board s view, removing all
references to Concept Statements in the guidance will simplify the codification and draw a distinction between authoritative and non-authoritative
literature. 

The
amendments in the Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. For all other
entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. The
Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

million through a mix of cash
and stock. The payment structure included million in cash, distributed in three equal installments, with the first installment occurring
at the merger closing and the other installments being paid on the first and second anniversaries of the merger closing. Additionally,
the Class A Common Stock consideration was settled through Class A Common Stock which represented a monetary equivalent calculated
against the closing trading price, alongside deferred stock consideration calculated with a 10-day VWAP formula. Adjustments were made
via amendments to redefine the terms and conditions of the deferred stock and cash considerations. The foregoing description of the Merger
Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Merger Agreement attached as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company s
Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 16, 2022. 

A
Second Amendment to the Merger Agreement, dated October 26, 2023, by and among the Company, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, Rockview Digital
Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation, d/b/a Abaca and Dan Roda, solely in such individual s capacity as the representative of
the Abaca security holders as referenced in Exhibit 2.1 of the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on October
27, 2023 (the Amended Abaca Merger Agreement amends the Merger Agreement to provide for deferred stock consideration of
 shares of Class A Common Stock to be issued at the first anniversary of the Abaca Merger Agreement based on a recalculated
value of per share. No changes affected the scheduled cash payments under the Amended Abaca Merger Agreement/the Merger Agreement.
Furthermore, a third-anniversary consideration of million was introduced, payable in cash or Class A Common Stock at the Company s
discretion, alongside an issue of stock warrants at an exercise price of per share of Class A Common Stock. The adjustments
and additional considerations have been valued and recorded according to ASC 815, reflecting changes in the fair value of deferred consideration
in the consolidated statements of operations.

Redemption
of warrants become exercisable when the price per share of Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds . Once the warrants become exercisable,
the Company may redeem the warrants: 

in
 whole and not in part; 

at
 a price of per warrant; 

upon
 not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and 

if,
 and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock splits,
 stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like and certain issuances of Class A Common Stock and equity-linked
 securities) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing no earlier than the date the warrants become exercisable
 and ending on the third business day before the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 

If
and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption rights; this is also the case if the
Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. 

If
the Company calls the warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Warrants
to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of Class A
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend,
or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of Class A Common
Stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants.

Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that the private placement warrants and the Class A Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants were not transferable, assignable or saleable, subject to certain limited
exceptions. Additionally, the private placement warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and non-redeemable so long as they are held
by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the private placement warrants are held by someone other than the initial
purchasers or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders
on the same basis as the public warrants.

exercised only during the period commencing 1 year of the Effective Date and terminating five years from the effective date of the
registration statement. The Company may, in its sole discretion, settle the Abaca Warrant when exercised, in whole or in part, in cash
in lieu of issuing shares of common stock underlying the Warrant. The Company may elect to pay the Registered Holder in cash in the amount
equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Company s Class A Common Stock on the date of exercise and the warrant
price multiplied by the number of shares of Class A Common Stock. The Company commits to promptly registering shares of Class
A Common Stock issued upon Abaca Warrant exercises if required by law, ensuring these shares can be sold without restrictions. This registration
must be filed within 45 days of receiving a notification of such a requirement, with failure to do so constituting a default. The Company
will endeavor to keep the registration effective until the Warrants expire. If the registration isn t effective within one year,
Abaca Warrant holders may exercise their Warrants on a cashless basis, receiving shares based on a defined fair market value calculation.
This process aims to facilitate the straightforward and lawful exercise of the Abaca Warrants, ensuring the shares issued are readily
tradable without the need for restrictive legends.

As
of September 30, 2024 and on December 31, 2023, the valuation of Private Placement Warrants, PIPE warrants, and Abaca warrants was carried
out using the Black-Scholes model, while the fair value of the Abaca third anniversary payment consideration was determined using the
Black Scholes Merton Option pricing model. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these warrants were valued using Level 3 inputs. 

As
of December 31, 2023, the Company assessed the fair value of its Forward Purchase Agreement (FPA) derivative utilizing a Monte Carlo
Simulation within a risk-neutral setting, which is a particular instance of the Income Approach, based on calculations from December
31, 2022. Throughout the periods ended September 30, of 2023 and 2024, there were no notable alterations in risk factors that would impact
the valuation of the FPA derivative. Consequently, management retained the December 31, 2022, valuation for December 31, 2023 and September
30, 2024. The Company will continue to monitor the fair value of the forward option derivative each reporting period with subsequent
revisions to be recorded in the Statements of Operations. 

During
the period ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, there were no changes in the classification of financial instruments within Level 2 and
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

for employees to render services and to exert maximum effort for the success of the Company. The Company s incentive stock options
generally permit net-share settlement upon exercise. The option exercise price, vesting schedule and exercise period are determined for
each grant by the administrator (person appointed by board to administer the stock plans) of the applicable plan. The Company s
stock options generally have a -year contractual term.

The
expected term of the options granted is calculated based on the simplified method by taking average of contractual term and vesting period
the awards. The shares and the redeemable warrants of the Company were listed on the stock exchange for a limited period of the time
and the share price has also dropped significantly from the date of listing. Based on these factors Management has considered the expected

Stock-Based
Compensation to Vendor 

On
September 3, 2024, the Company issued shares of common stock to Outside The Box Capital Inc. as compensation for marketing and
distribution services under a Marketing Services Agreement. The fair value of the common stock issued was determined based on the market
price of the Company s stock on the grant date, which was per share, resulting in a total fair value of . The fair
value of the award is recorded as an expense under General and administrative expenses in the income statement, with
the expense being recognized over the service period from September 4, 2024, to March 3, 2025, aligning with the period during which
the services are rendered. In accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, as updated by ASU 2018-07,
the stock award has been classified as equity as it is settled through the issuance of common stock and does not contain any terms requiring
cash settlement or other liabilities. 

, the Staff will provide written confirmation that the Company has achieved compliance.
If the Company does not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by the end of the second compliance period, the Common
Stock will become subject to delisting. In the event that the Company receives notice that the Common Stock is being delisted, the Nasdaq
listing rules permit the Company to appeal a delisting determination by the Staff to a hearings panel. There can be no assurance that
the Company will be able to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq
Listing Rules. However, the Company intends to actively monitor the closing bid price for the Common Stock and will consider available
options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, including initiating a reverse stock
split. If the Company chooses to implement a reverse stock split, we must complete the reverse stock split no later than 10 business
days prior to the expiration date of the additional compliance period on March 31, 2025 in order to timely regain compliance.

Item
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD A) OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Unless
the context otherwise requires, references in this section to we, us, or our refer to SHF Holdings,
Inc and its subsidiaries (herein referred to as the Company ). References to management refer to our officers
and Board of Directors. The following discussion and analysis of our financial performance and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Forward
Looking Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events
or our future financial or operating performance and may include statements concerning, among other things, our business strategy (including
anticipated trends and developments in, and management plans for, our business and the markets in which we operate), financial results,
results of operations, revenues, operating expenses, and capital expenditures, sales and marketing initiatives and competition. In some
cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as may, might, will, 
 should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, 
 target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, 
 suggests, potential or continue or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions
that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance; they reflect
our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from expectations or results
projected or implied by forward-looking statements. 

We
discuss many of these risks in other filings we make from time to time with the SEC. Also, these forward-looking statements represent
our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which are inherently subject to change and involve
risks and uncertainties. Unless required by federal securities laws, we assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements,
or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated, to reflect circumstances or events that occur
after the statements are made. Given these uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. 

Investors
should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this report and have filed with the SEC, including
our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially
different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 

Overview 

We
provide services to a variety of cannabis-industry participants in 41 states, including financial institutions that support business
banking, private banking and commercial banking services to their customers, particularly those customers conducting business in or adjacent
to the cannabis industry. Our services include, among other things: 

regulatory
 compliance consulting and software enabled service for maintaining Know Your Customer KYC and Bank
 Secrecy Act BSA compliance to financial institutions, principally conducted vis- -vis our proprietary financial
 services platform; 

the
 origination, onboarding, verification, and servicing of cannabis-related deposit business for and on behalf of our partner financial
 institutions; and 

sourcing,
 underwriting, servicing, and administering loans issued to cannabis businesses and related entities, which are often also our customers,
 as well as being customers of our partner financial institutions. 

Financial
Services Platform 

The
Company has developed and commercialized a software-based services platform for financial institutions providing banking services to
cannabis-related businesses CRBs ). Our software enabled services access and maintain reliable financial information to
enable both our financial institution clients and our CRB clients to meet regulatory requirements. Our platform has been streamlined
and fine-tuned since 2014. Our software platform enables the Company s staff to efficiently guide financial institution clients
and CRBs desiring banking services through the onboarding, validation and monitoring process. Our automated platform provides for an
efficient and effective management tool allowing our employees to provide continuity of service while enabling compliance staff to monitor
BSA activities. 

Through
the Company s financial services platform, our financial institution clients have the ability to provide CRBs with access to traditional
financial services including wires, debit, ACH, remote deposit capture, business checking and savings accounts, courier and vaulting
services, cash management accounts and commercial lending. We believe our services have been implemented consistent with applicable law
and regulations, ensuring our financial institution clients will be able to provide CRBs with reliable access to these services. We feel
our history of developing processes that satisfy regulatory standards has resulted in a solid reputation with related authorities and
solidifies our ability to continue to grow existing services while simultaneously reducing barriers to expanding into new service offerings. 

32 

CRB
Deposits 

The
Company maintains relationships with PCCU and other financial institutions in which CRBs funds are deposited and monetary transactions
are performed. The Company s agreements with the financial institution allow the Company s platform to interface with the
financial institution s core banking systems to monitor account activity for those accounts the Company facilitated the onboarding. 

The
Company earns income on deposit activity and from onboarding fees, which have historically been the majority of our revenue. When we
help establish a new relationship between a CRB or ancillary service provider with our financial institution clients for which the Company
provides its onboarding services, an initial onboarding fee is assessed based on the type and complexity of the business. Onboarding
is an important part of the KYC requirements set forth in federal guidance. Additionally, the Company assesses fees monthly based on
the frequency and amount of deposit activity fees of the applicable CRB client. These fees are also based on business type and size. 

The
Company earns investment income based on the balances maintained on deposit by our CRB clients with our financial institution clients.
Our financial institution clients invest the deposits of our CRB clients principally in US Treasury Federal Overnight Securities. We
recognize revenue pursuant to the interest earned on these deposit balances and incur a cost of revenue we owe to the financial institution
for facilitating the investment activity. Under our PCCU CAA, the Company pays 25 of the investment income as a hosting cost of revenue
fee to PCCU based on the earned investment income from the CRB deposit balances maintained at PCCU. Through its relationship with PCCU,
depository amounts invested are typically restricted to low-risk assets with high liquidity and modest returns. The investment income
is significantly influenced by the levels of CRB deposits and the prevailing interest rate environment for cash and similar assets. 

Commercial
Lending Program 

We earn interest income from lending activity we facilitate between our CRB clients and our financial institution clients and to a lesser
extent, direct lending by the Company. The robust CRB deposits onboarded by the Company and held at PCCU provide a strong foundation
for lending capacity. In 2020, the Company launched a commercial lending program that has developed to be our largest revenue component
by value and percentage. The program focuses on senior secured lending, with smaller unsecured loans also being considered. Collateral
types include real estate, equipment, and other business assets. 

Currently,
lending is primarily funded through PCCU. The Company is seeking relationships with additional financial institutions and other sources
of working capital to directly fund the loans. The Company, in collaboration with third parties manages loan underwriting and loan servicing.
As the program develops, the Company intends to establish a full-service internal lending function to perform a larger percentage of
the underwriting and servicing activities, improve efficiency and increase profitability of this revenue element. 

33 

Key
Metrics 

In
addition to the measures presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, our management regularly monitors certain
measures in the operation of our business. These key metrics are discussed below. 

Non-GAAP
Measures 

We
use certain non-GAAP measures, referenced in this MD A. These measures are not recognized measures under GAAP and do not have a standardized
meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Accordingly, these measures
should not be considered in isolation from nor as a substitute for our financial information reported under GAAP. We use non-GAAP measures
including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin which may be calculated differently by other companies. These non-GAAP measures
and metrics are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and liquidity and thus highlight trends
in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures
should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the
GAAP financial measures presented. We also recognize that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use
non-GAAP measures in the evaluation of companies within our industry. 

Earnings
Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 

To
provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both of
which are non-GAAP financial measures that we calculate as net income before taxes and depreciation and amortization expense in the case
of EBITDA and further adjusted to exclude non-cash, unusual and/or infrequent costs in the case of Adjusted EBITDA. Below we have provided
a reconciliation of net (loss)/income (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) to EBITDA and from EBITDA to Adjusted
EBITDA. 

We
present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because these metrics are a key measure used by our management to evaluate our operating performance,
generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of investment capacity. Accordingly, we believe
that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results
in the same manner as our management. 

EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis
of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows: 

although
 depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future,
 and both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital
 expenditure requirements; 

EBITDA
 and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and 

EBITDA
 and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. 

Because
of these limitations, you should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss
and our other U.S. GAAP results.

reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our EBITDA income improved primarily as a result of decrease in General and Administrative
expenses. This reduction was driven by lower investment hosting fees, decreased amortization and depreciation expenses, and reduced business
insurance costs. Additionally, there were decreases in compensation, employee benefits, marketing expenses, and other insurance costs.
These factors contributing to our financial performance are further discussed in the Discussion of our Results of Operations 
section below. Other adjustments include estimated future credit losses not yet realized, including amounts indemnified to PCCU for loans
funded by them. The Company has entered into a Commercial Alliance Agreement with PCCU (referred to as PCCU CAA ), pursuant
to which the Company agreed to indemnify PCCU for claims associated with CRB activities including any loan default related losses for
loans funded by PCCU. Deferred loan origination fees and costs represent the change in net deferred loan origination fees and costs.
When included with a new loan origination, we receive an upfront loan origination fee in conjunction with new loans funded by our financial
institution partners and incur costs associated with originating a specific loan. For accounting purposes, the cash received for loan
origination fees and costs is initially deferred and recognized as interest income utilizing the interest method. 

Other
Metrics 

For
our business operations, we monitor the following key metrics. 

Total
account balances, number of accounts and average account balances 

Our
lending capacity is dependent on the size of our managed deposit base and number of active accounts. In addition, fees are generated
based on open accounts and account activity. We monitor account activity including deposits, withdrawals and ending account balance daily.
Total account balances represent the balance of onboarded and monitored deposits on hand at financial institution clients at period end.
Average account balance represents the total account balance divided by the number of accounts at the period end. 

Account
fees per average active accounts managed 

Currently
a significant amount of our fees are generated from account openings, active accounts and account activity. As a result, we monitor account
openings and closings on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. We strive to meet the appropriate balance between depository balances and
fees and therefore review account fees per average number of active accounts managed.

 Refer
 to the below section Discussion of Results of our Operations for additional discussion of trends. 

35 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a decline in the average number of accounts and fees compared to the previous period,
primarily due to a decrease in clientele following the termination of an agreement with the Central Bank of Arkansas. We expect this
trend to shift as we lead with our lending program typically requiring borrowers to place deposits with financial institutions with which
we have relationships. 

We
are focused on enhancing and growing our lending platform. Incremental lending key metrics will be monitored as this portion of our business
grows in volume. Metrics will include average loan balance, average life to repayment, average effective interest rate and loan status,
amongst others. 

Components

Account
fee income consists of deposit account fees, activity fees and onboarding income. We receive a flat fee and lower rates for ancillary
accounts, which are accounts provided to businesses servicing the cannabis industry in general but do not manufacture, possess, distribute
or transport cannabis. 

 The
decrease in deposit, activity and onboarding income was primarily attributable to the decrease in the number of accounts related to the
Abaca acquisition. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, PCCU accounted for 3,778,633 of the revenue generated from deposits,
activities, and client onboarding. Related to this revenue, the Company recognized 356,369 in account hosting expenses, in accordance
with the PCCU CAA. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, PCCU contributed 4,051,353 to the revenue from similar sources, with
account hosting expenses amounting to 170,987 as per the Loan Servicing Agreement provisions. These expenses were categorized under
 General and Administrative Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

The
Company provides similar account services and outsourced support to other financial institutions providing banking services to the cannabis
industry.

Under
our Commercial Alliance Agreement with PCCU PCCU CAA ), we pay 25 of the investment income as a hosting fee based on this
income. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the income derived from investment income associated with PCCU totaled 1,601,611.
In relation to this income, the Company incurred 374,591 in investment hosting fees, consistent with the stipulations of the PCCU CAA.
In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, PCCU s contribution to investment income amounted to 4,051,353, against which the
Company recorded investment hosting fees of 978,671, as governed by the terms of the Loan Servicing Agreement. These expenses were categorized
under General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

We
previously had a Loan Servicing Agreement with PCCU (related party) which has since been superseded by the PCCU CAA. The loan interest
income reflects our share of loan interest on issued loans. We are obligated to pay 0.35 on the total outstanding principal of each
loan that is funded and serviced by PCCU. Loan interest earned on the Company s direct loans and the indemnified loans grew as
the Company increased its focus on lending. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SHF serviced twenty-four loans, as compared
to twelve loans in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In nine months ended September 2024, the Company recognized 4,814,349 in
loan interest income attributable to PCCU activities. The related expenses for this income included 106,946 in loan servicing fees,
in compliance with both the Loan Servicing Agreement and the PCCU CAA. In nine months ended September 2023, loan interest income from
PCCU operations amounted to 1,977,337, with associated loan servicing fees totaling 53,790, pursuant to the same agreements. These
expenses were categorized under General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

of stock-based compensation and also related to a reduction in force. 

Rent

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased across various categories including: i) approximately
 604,080 in investment hosting fees due to a reduction in investment income, and ii) approximately 535,179 in amortization and depreciation

For

decline in the fair value adjustment on the stock and cash consideration payable to the Abaca shareholders, as a result of payments made
before the end of 2023, and a decrease in the share price as of September 30,2024, which affected the fair value of the third anniversary
payment. 

The
interest expenses decreased by 551,135, primarily due to the elimination of the interest component on the deferred cash consideration
payable to the PCCU related to the business combination, which was settled and restructured at the end of the first quarter of 2023. 

The
change in the fair value of warrant liabilities by 3,173,843 was attributable to the decrease in the share price.

Account
fee income consists of deposit account fees, activity fees and onboarding income. We receive a flat fee and lower rates for ancillary
accounts, which are accounts provided to businesses servicing the cannabis industry in general but do not manufacture, possess, distribute
or transport cannabis. 

37 

The
decrease in deposit, activity and onboarding income was primarily attributable to the decrease in the number of accounts related to the
Abaca acquisition. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, PCCU accounted for 1,354,036 of the revenue generated from deposits,
activities, and client onboarding. Related to this revenue, the Company recognized 131,002 in account hosting expenses, in accordance
with the PCCU CAA. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, PCCU contributed 1,287,669 to the revenue from similar sources, with
account hosting expenses amounting to 54,729 as per the Loan Servicing Agreement provisions. These expenses were categorized under
 General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

The
Company provides similar account services and outsourced support to other financial institutions providing banking to the cannabis industry.
These services are provided under the Safe Harbor Master Program Agreement. 

We
have agreements with PCCU (related party) and Five Star Bank (FSB) where our financial institution clients pay us interest on the daily
account balance as per the rates in the agreements. Under our Commercial Alliance Agreement with PCCU PCCU CAA ), we pay
25 of the investment income as a hosting fee based on this income. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the income derived
from investment income associated with PCCU totaled 434,949. In relation to this income, the Company incurred 96,870 in investment
hosting fees, consistent with the stipulations of the PCCU CAA. In three months ended September 30, 2023, PCCU s contribution to
investment income amounted to 1,186,246, against which the Company recorded investment hosting fees of 273,939, as governed by the
terms of the Loan Servicing Agreement. These expenses were categorized under General and administrative expenses in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

We
had a Loan Servicing Agreement with PCCU (related party) where our financial institution carries the loan balances on their financial
statement; the Loan Servicing Agreement has since been superseded by the PCCU CAA. The loan interest income reflects our share of loan
interest on issued loans. We are obligated to pay 0.35 on the total outstanding principal of each loan that is funded and serviced by
PCCU. Loan interest earned on the Company s direct loans and the indemnified loans grew as the Company increased its focus on lending.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, SHF serviced twenty-four loans, as compared to twelve loans in the quarter ended September
30, 2023. In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized 1,341,501 in loan interest income attributable to PCCU activities.
Related expenses for this income included 34,889 in loan servicing fees, in compliance with both the Loan Servicing Agreement and the
PCCU CAA. In the quarter ended September 30, 2023, loan interest income from PCCU operations amounted to 906,213, with associated loan
servicing fees totaling 25,120, pursuant to the same agreements. These expenses were categorized under General and Administrative
Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Financial
Condition 

Cash
and cash equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents totaled 5,861,475 and 4,888,769 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

38 

Cash
flows 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated 3,207,069 in cash from operations, compared to cash used of 225,032
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This improvement was mainly due to lower operating expenses and the greater number of performing
loans at better interest rates than the previous period. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated 8,173 in cash from investing activities, compared to 783,481 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of loans by customers in the previous period. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used 2,242,536 in cash for financing activities, compared to zero cash flow in
the corresponding period of 2023. This was mainly due to the repayments on the senior secured promissory note during 2024, which was
not in place during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and going concern 

Liquidity
refers to our capacity to fulfill anticipated cash demands, encompassing obligations to settle debt, sustain assets and operations, distribute
earnings to shareholders, and cover other typical business expenditures. Our cash outflows predominantly settle towards repaying debt
principal and interest, distributing dividends to shareholders, and financing our operational activities. The main contributors to our
liquidity are the cash inflows from our operational performance. As of September 30, 2024, the Company reports no significant commitments
to capital investments. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had 5,861,475 in cash and net working capital deficit of 2,520,441 as compared to 4,888,769 in
cash and net working capital deficit of 135,355 as at December 31, 2023. The retained deficit was 69,091,050 on September 30, 2024,
and 71,569,821 on December 31, 2023. The Company has also generated operating income of 176,909 and 802,013 for the three months and
nine months period ended September 30, 2024. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported positive operating income. However, considering the historical data from
the four preceding quarters, where the Company experienced negative operating income and negative net working capital, management acknowledges
the need to closely evaluate the financial performance in upcoming quarters to mitigate any going concern risks. As of September 30,
2024, due to these historical trends, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for
at least twelve months from the date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. 

If
the Company is not able to sustain its present level of operations, it may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms
with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, or suspend or curtail planned expansion programs. Any of these actions could materially
harm the Company s business, results of operations and future prospects. 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or amounts and classification
of liabilities that may result should the Company not continue as a going concern as a result of this uncertainty. 

Litigation

As
reported on its Current Report on Form 8-K, on October 17, 2024 the Company caused a declaratory judgment complaint to be filed in the
District Court for the City and County of Denver, Colorado, captioned SHF Holdings, Inc. v. Daniel Roda, Gregory W. Ellis, and James
R. Carroll, Case No. 2024CV33187, Denver County District Court Declaratory Judgement Complaint ). The Declaratory Judgement
Complaint was filed related to the Amended Abaca Merger Agreement, dated October 26, 2023. On November 4, 2024, in connection with the
Declaratory Judgment Complaint, the Company filed a motion with the court requesting that the court authorize the Company to deposit
the 3,000,000 payment owed pursuant to the Amended Abaca Merger Agreement into the court s registry so that it can be distributed
in accordance with the terms of the Amended Abaca Merger Agreement. The payment obligation of 3,000,000 has already been accounted for
in the working capital deficit disclosed in the Liquidity and Going Concern section . 

39 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

As
of September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in the application or the nature of accounting estimates that are considered
critical in nature from those presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

We
are an emerging growth company, or EGC, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the
 JOBS Act ). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are
applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory
vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an EGC can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section
7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an EGC can delay the adoption
of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the
benefits of this extended transition period, for as long as it is available. We will remain an EGC until the earlier of (1) the last
day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act (June 23, 2026) or (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at
least 1.07 billion, (2) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common
stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter,
and (3) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References
herein to emerging growth company have the meaning provided in the JOBS Act. 

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

In
connection with our management assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of and for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company has identified two (2) material weaknesses within our internal controls associated with Revenue Recognition and
Complex Financial Instruments. Refer to Item 4 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details. 

Related
Party Relationships 

Account
Servicing Agreement 

The
Company had an Account Servicing Agreement with PCCU. SHF provides services as per the agreement to CRB accounts at PCCU. In addition
to providing the services, SHF assumed the costs associated with the CRB accounts. These costs include employees to manage account onboarding,
monitoring and compliance, rent and office expense, insurance and other operating expenses necessary to service these accounts. Under
the agreement, PCCU agreed to pay SHF all revenue generated from CRB accounts. Amounts due to SHF were due monthly in arrears and upon
receipt of invoice. This agreement was replaced and superseded in its entirety by PCCU CAA entered on March 29, 2023, between PCCU and
the Company. 

Support
Services Agreement 

On
July 1, 2021, SHF entered into a Support Services Agreement with PCCU. In connection with PCCU hosting the depository accounts and the
related loans and providing certain infrastructure support, PCCU receives (and SHF pays) a monthly fee per depository account. In addition,
25 of any investment income associated with CRB deposits is paid to PCCU. This agreement was replaced and superseded in its entirety
by PCCU CAA entered on March 29, 2023, between PCCU and the Company. 

40 

Effective
February 11, 2022, SHF entered into a Loan Servicing Agreement with PCCU. The agreement sets forth the application, underwriting and
approval process for loans from PCCU to CRB customers and the loan servicing and monitoring responsibilities provided by both PCCU and
SHF. PCCU receives a monthly servicing fee at the annual rate of 0.25 of the then-outstanding principal balance of each loan funded
and serviced by PCCU. For the loans that are subject to this agreement, SHF originates the loans and performs all compliance analysis,
credit analysis of the potential borrower, due diligence and underwriting and all administration, including hiring and incurring the
costs of all related personnel or third-party vendors necessary to perform these services. Under the Loan Servicing Agreement, SHF has
agreed to indemnify PCCU from all claims related to default-related credit losses as defined in the Loan Servicing Agreement. This agreement
was replaced and superseded in its entirety by PCCU CAA entered on March 29, 2023, between PCCU and the Company. 

Commercial
Alliance Agreement 

On
March 29, 2023, the Company and PCCU entered into the Commercial Alliance Agreement (referred to as PCCU CAA). This Agreement sets forth
the terms and conditions of the lending and account-related services, governing the relationship between the Company and PCCU. The PCCU
CAA sets forth the application, underwriting, loan approval, and foreclosure process for loans from PCCU to borrowers that are cannabis-related
businesses and the loan servicing and monitoring responsibilities provided by the Company and PCCU. In particular, the PCCU CAA provides
for procedures to be followed upon the default of a loan to ensure that neither the Company nor PCCU will take title to or possession
of any cannabis-related assets, including real property, that may be collateral for a loan funded by PCCU pursuant to the PCCU CAA. Under
the PCCU CAA, the PCCU has the right to receive monthly fees for managing loans. For SHF-serviced loans, which are CRB loans provided
by the PCCU but primarily handled by SHF, a yearly fee of 0.25 of the remaining loan balance is applied. On the other hand, loans both
financed and serviced by the PCCU are charged a yearly fee of 0.35 on their outstanding balance. These fees are calculated using the
average daily balance of each loan for the preceding month. In addition, the Company s is obligated by the PCCU CAA to indemnify
PCCU from certain default-related loan losses (as fully defined in the PCCU CAA). 

In
addition, the PCCU CAA provides for certain fees to be paid to the Company for certain identified account related services to include:
all cannabis-related income, including all lending-related income (such as loan origination fees, interest income on CRB-related loans,
participation fees and servicing fees), investment income, interest income, account activity fees, processing fees, flat fees, and other
revenue generated from cannabis and multi-state hemp accounts that are hosted on PCCU s core system for a monthly fee equal to
 30.96 per account in 2022, 25.32- 27.85 per account in 2023, and 26.08- 28.69 in 2024. In addition, as it pertains to CRB deposits
held at PCCU, investment and interest income earned on these deposits (excluding interest income on loans funded by PCCU) will be shared
25 to PCCU and 75 to the Company. Finally, under the PCCU CAA, PCCU will continue to allow its ratio of CRB-related deposits to total
assets to equal at least 60 unless otherwise dictated by regulatory, regulator or policy requirements. The initial term of the PCCU
CAA is for a period of two years, with a one-year automatic renewal unless a party provides one hundred twenty days written notice
prior to the end of the term.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

The
Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information otherwise
required with respect to market risk. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024
due to the material weaknesses described below. In light of these material weaknesses, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary
to ensure that our unaudited interim financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Accordingly, management believes that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, solely due to the below-mentioned material weaknesses, the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of September 30,
2024.

Material
Weaknesses 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. 

 We
consider the following material weaknesses to be outstanding as of September 30, 2024, which existed at previous periods: 

Revenue
Recognition : The Company s revenue is earned through certain related party contracts with PCCU that define contractually
the revenue earned by the Company from PCCU for account servicing. The Company has identified a material weakness in our internal control
over financial reporting related to the need to enhance the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the review of
revenue recognition from allocations that occurs on a monthly basis between the Company and PCCU. 

To
remediate this material weakness, the Company has implemented a monthly process with enhanced management review controls to perform and
review revenue recognition. The analysis and disclosures are assessed by senior management of the Company performing review of the documentation
and disclosures. 

Complex
Financial Instruments: The Company has had a material weakness with regard to the ineffectiveness in management review controls
of the accounting, disclosure and valuation of complex financial instruments (warrants, deferred consideration, forward purchase agreement,
and stock-based compensation). 

To
remediate this material weakness, the Company has implemented a quarterly process with enhanced management review controls to perform
and review complex financial instruments. The analysis and disclosures are assessed by senior management of the Company performing review
of the documentation and disclosures. 

With
the implementation of our remediation plans for each material weakness, we believe, in subsequent periods, these material weaknesses
can be remediated. 

We
plan to continue to assess and improve our internal controls and procedures and to take further action as necessary or appropriate to
address any other matters we identify. 

Completion
of remediation does not provide assurance that our remediation or other controls will continue to operate properly. A failure to maintain
effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in errors in its financial statements that could require the Company
to restate past financial statements, cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence
in the Company s reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect the Company. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than as noted above in the September 30, 2024 material weaknesses, there was no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 covered by this Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

The
Company s management has expended, and will continue to expend, a substantial amount of effort and resources for their mediation
of the material weaknesses and improvement of our internal control over financial reporting. While we have processes to properly identify
and evaluate the appropriate accounting technical pronouncements and other literature for all significant or unusual transactions, we
have expanded and will continue to improve these processes to ensure that the nuances of such transactions are effectively evaluated
in the context of the increasingly complex accounting standards.
