 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

INTRODUCTION 
 
 This management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations is intended to assist you in understanding the Company's past performance, financial condition and prospects. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, along with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in and referred to within this report. 

OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS 
 
 Graphic Packaging is a leading global provider of consumer goods packaging made from renewable or recycled materials. The Company designs and manufactures sustainable packaging solutions including cartons, multipack cartons, trays, carriers, paperboard canisters, and cups and bowls, made primarily from unbleached paperboard, recycled paperboard, and bleached paperboard. Paperboard used in its packaging solutions comes from wood fiber, a renewable resource, and from secondary (reused) fiber. Graphic Packaging s consumer packaging is designed to be recycled, and the Company works across the value chain to make it easier for people to recycle. With this focus, the Company plays an active role in support of the move to a more circular economy and a sustainable future for generations to come. Graphic Packaging s commitment to reducing the environmental impact of everyday consumer packaging is fundamental to our strategy, our goals, and to our business purpose. 
 
 The Company serves a wide variety of consumer nondurables (consumer staples) markets, from food and beverage, to foodservice, household products, beauty and heath care. It produces packaging solutions at over 100 locations in over 25 countries around the world, serving customers and brands ranging from local consumer products companies and retailers to the largest multinationals. The Company offers one of the most comprehensive ranges of packaging design, manufacture, and execution capabilities available. Graphic Packaging manufactures a significant amount of the paperboard that it uses to produce packaging solutions, mainly where it believes that self-manufacture provides it with a competitive advantage and allows the Company to deliver better, more consistent results for customers. The Company currently manufactures most of the paperboard it consumes in the Americas and purchases from third parties the majority of the paperboard it consumes in its Europe Paperboard Packaging segment. 
 
 Graphic Packaging works closely with its customers to understand their needs and goals and to create new and innovative designs customized to their specific needs. The Company s approach serves to build and strengthen long-term relationships with purchasing, brand management, marketing, and other key customer functions. The Company is organized to bring the full resources of its global and local innovation, design, and manufacturing capabilities to all of its customers, with the goal of delivering packaging solutions that are more circular, more functional, and more convenient. 
 
 The Company competes with a wide range of packaging companies whose primary raw materials are paperboard, plastic, multi-layer laminates, shrink film, paper, corrugated board, biobased materials and other packaging materials. While circularity and sustainability are increasingly important to customer purchase decisions, the Company also competes on the basis of product innovation, price, and execution capabilities. Many of the Company s multi-year supply contracts include terms which provide for the pass through of certain costs including raw materials, energy, labor and other manufacturing costs, with the intention of reducing exposure to the volatility of these costs, many of which are outside of the Company s control. 
 
 The Company is implementing strategies (i) to expand market share in its current markets and to identify and penetrate new markets; (ii) to capitalize on the Company s customer relationships, business competencies, and manufacturing facilities; (iii) to develop and market innovative, packaging products and applications that benefit from consumer-led sustainability trends; and (iv) to continue to reduce costs by focusing on operational improvements. The Company s ability to fully implement its strategies and achieve its objectives may be influenced by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond its control. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact that rising interest rates, a global or any regional recession, or higher inflation may have on our customers or suppliers. Additionally, we are unable to predict the potential effects that any future pandemic or other global health emergency and widespread military and geopolitical conflicts and other social and political unrest or change, including Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and related sanctions or market disruptions, may have on our business. 

Acquisitions and Dispositions 
 
 On May 1, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Augusta, Georgia bleached paperboard manufacturing facility (the Augusta divestiture to Clearwater Paper Corporation for a total consideration of 711 million. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company decided to close multiple packaging facilities by the end of 2024. These are in addition to the multiple packaging facilities for which the Company decided to close by the end of 2023 and early 2024.

Segment Reporting 
 
 The Company has three reportable segments as follows: 
 
 Americas Paperboard Packaging includes paperboard packaging sold primarily to consumer packaged goods CPG companies serving the food, beverage, and consumer product markets and cups, lids and food containers sold primarily to foodservice companies and quick-service restaurants QSR in the Americas. 
 
 Europe Paperboard Packaging includes paperboard packaging sold primarily to CPG companies serving the food, beverage and consumer product markets, including healthcare and beauty, primarily in Europe. 
 
 Paperboard Manufacturing includes the six North American paperboard manufacturing facilities that produce recycled, unbleached and bleached paperboard, which is consumed internally to produce paperboard consumer packaging for the Americas and Europe Paperboard Packaging segments. Paperboard not consumed internally is sold externally to a wide variety of paperboard packaging converters and brokers. The Paperboard Manufacturing segment's Net Sales represent the sale of paperboard only to external customers. The effect of intercompany transfers to the paperboard packaging segments has been eliminated from the Paperboard Manufacturing segment to reflect the economics of the integration of these segments. 
 
 The Company allocates certain paperboard manufacturing and corporate costs to the reportable segments to appropriately represent the economics of these segments. The Corporate and Other caption includes the Pacific Rim and Australia operating segments and unallocated corporate and one-time costs. 
 
 These segments are evaluated by the chief operating decision maker based primarily on Income from Operations, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described above in Note 1 - General Information in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Under the terms of the Current Credit Agreement, the Company must comply with a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio covenant and a minimum Consolidated Interest Expense Ratio covenant. 
 
 The Current Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of less than 4.25 to 1.00. At September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with such covenant and the ratio was 2.85 to 1.00. 
 
 The Company must also comply with a minimum Consolidated Interest Expense Ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. At September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with such covenant and the ratio was 7.39 to 1.00. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's credit was rated BB+ by Standard Poor's and Ba1 by Moody's Investor Services. Standard Poor's and Moody's Investor Services' ratings on the Company included a stable outlook. 

Environmental Matters 
 
 Some of the Company s current and former facilities are the subject of environmental investigations and remediations resulting from historical operations and the release of hazardous substances or other constituents. Some current and former facilities have a history of industrial usage for which investigation and remediation obligations may be imposed in the future or for which indemnification claims may be asserted against the Company. Also, closures or sales of facilities may necessitate further investigation and may result in remediation at those facilities. The Company has established reserves for those facilities or issues where a liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable. The Company believes that the amounts accrued for its loss contingencies, and the reasonably possible loss beyond the amounts accrued, are not material to the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 For further discussion of the Company s environmental matters, see Note 9 - Environmental and Legal Matters in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. The critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the Company s financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. 
 
 The Company s most critical accounting policies, which require significant judgment or involve complex estimations, are described in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2023. The Company concluded that all reporting units with goodwill have a fair value that exceeds their carrying value, and thus goodwill was not impaired. The Europe reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its respective carrying value by 26 , whereas all other reporting units exceeded by more than 90 . The Europe reporting unit had goodwill totaling 500 million at September 30, 2024.

 The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of its short-term and long-term debt, which include both fixed and floating rate debt. The Company has previously used interest rate swap agreements effectively to fix the SOFR rate on certain variable rate borrowings. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no active interest rate swap agreements. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon such evaluation, management has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
