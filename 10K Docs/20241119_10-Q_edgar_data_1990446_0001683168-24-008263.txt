NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

Basis of Accounting 

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Trans American Aquaculture, Inc and its wholly owned subsidiary Trans American
Aquaculture, LLC, a Texas Limited Liability Company. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes
of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents. 

Inventory 

Inventory is valued at lower of
cost or the net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. Depending on the development and growth stage of shrimp, the Company s
inventory is comprised of 1) broodstock held for restocking the next harvest cycle, 2) broodstock held for sale, and shrimp held for sale.
The Company evaluates realization of shrimp based on market prices at the end of each period.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance
and repairs are expensed while expenditures for renewals which prolong the lives of the assets are capitalized. When items are disposed
of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any net gain or loss is included in the consolidated statement
of income. 

For financial reporting purposes, depreciation
of property and equipment is provided for by using the straight-line method based on the estimated service lives of the property as follows: 

Land improvements 
 40 years 
 
 Buildings and structures 
 40 years 
 
 Farm equipment 
 10 20 years 
 
 Autos and trucks 
 10 years 

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If it is determined
that an asset has been impaired, the amount of the impairment is charged to operations. No impairments were recognized for the periods
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 

Income Taxes 

The Company uses an asset and
liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. The difference between the financial statement and tax basis
of assets and liabilities is determined annually. 

Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are computed for those differences that have future tax consequences using the currently enacted tax laws and rates that apply
to the periods in which they are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, if necessary, to reduce the
deferred tax asset to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. Income tax expense is the current tax payable or refundable
for the period, plus or minus the net change in the deferred tax assets and liabilities. 

The Company's income tax returns
are subject to examination by the appropriate tax jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company needs to file federal and state
income tax returns for 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. During 2020, the Company had taxable income primarily as a result of a short-term capital
gain of 445,500 on the sale of a joint venture interest. This resulted in taxable income of 155,200 and an unremitted federal income
tax liability of 33,180. With accrued penalties and interest, the total due the IRS is approximately 58,300. All liabilities, including
federal taxes, were indemnified by Goulding as part of the transaction and accordingly a receivable due from the previous owner of the
Company has been recorded and netted against the tax obligation. The Company intends to file its 2020 federal tax return and pay the tax
due, plus penalties in interest once it has sufficient cash to do so.

 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenues according to the
Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB Accounting Standard Codification ASC 606 and Accounting Standard
Update ASU 2014-09 Revenues from Contracts with Customers. Under the ASC 606, revenues is recognized when the customer obtains
control of promised goods or services in amounts that reflect the consideration which the entity expected to receive in exchange of goods
and service. The Company does not collect sales, value-add and other taxes collected on behalf of third parties. To determine revenue
recognition, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract with customer; (2) identify the performance obligations
in contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract; and
(5) recognize revenues when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

The Company recognizes revenue as a single performance
obligation when it transfers its products to customers, being when the goods are shipped and transfers to a buyer and when performance
obligation under contracted sales are completed. 

Advertising and Promotion 

All costs
associated with advertising and promoting the Company's goods and services are expensed in the year incurred. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

The Company's financial instruments
that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments and accounts receivable. 

The Company
maintains its cash balances at a large financial institution. At times such balances may exceed federally insured limits. The Company
has not experienced any losses in an account. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and had no
balances in excess of the 250,000 FDIC limit for the period ended September 30, 2024. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, two and one customer accounted for 100 of total revenues earned. 

The Company s sole source
of expected future revenue consists of the sale of a single live product which requires substantial care. Production risks such
as weather, disease and other factors could affect the Company s ability to realize revenue from its inventory stock.

Subsequent Events 

In preparing
these consolidated financial statements, the Company has evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through
November 19, 2024, the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. 

Net Loss Per Share 

Basic net
loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive
potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of the Company is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application
of the treasury stock method. The dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share when net loss is
recorded for the period as their effect would be anti-dilutive. 

NOTE 3 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 

On
December 11, 2023, the Company entered into an accounts receivable factoring agreement in the amount of 750,000. The agreement
calls for 80 with recourse financing on eligible receivables. The amount received for the factored receivables on February 7, 2024, totaled
 135,847, of which 12,357 remains outstanding after factoring fees at September 30, 2024 and 0 at December 31, 2023. 

NOTE 4 INVENTORY 

The inventory at September 30,
2024, consists of shrimp held for sale and broodstock held for restocking. Included in this amount is the broodstock cost basis reclassified
to shrimp held for sale as those costs are applicable expenditures and charges directly and indirectly incurred in bringing shrimp inventory
to its existing condition and location as noted in FASB ASC 330-10-30. Although, these animals will eventually come to end of life, their
costs are considered part of the necessary costs to birthing and raising shrimp held for sale. 

Just prior to harvest, the Company
segregates and retains selected premium shrimp to become broodstock for the following shrimp harvest cycle. Upon identification and segregation,
the selected animals are transferred from outdoor ponds to specialized indoor tanks. These tanks are highly regulated with respect to
temperature, lighting and salinity levels. Costs allocated to broodstock animals at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled 210,000
and 60,388, respectively. 

The Company recorded inventory write-down of 196,552
related to the death of broodstock in its aquaculture operations. The number of broodstock animals held decreased from 15,400 to 3,000
during the three-months ended September 30, 2024. The write-down is included in the cost of revenues in the consolidated statement of
operations.

NOTE 8 INCOME TAX
(CONTINUED) 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be covered
or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
the enactment date. An allowance has been recorded as of September 30, 2024 due to uncertainty of the realization of deferred tax asset
in future periods. 

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable
on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period, and any
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 

In accordance with FASB
Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, included in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, the Company recognizes the
effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are
measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected
in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. There were no uncertain tax positions that required recognition by the Company.
As of the date of these consolidated financial statements, the Company s federal and various state tax returns will generally remain
open for the last three years. 

The Company s provision
for income taxes attributable to income before income taxes for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, consisted

shares of the Company s common stock. 

The EFA
grants the Company the right, to direct GHS to purchase shares of the Company s common stock on any business day (a Put ),
provided that at least ten trading days (as defined in the EFA) have passed since the closing of the most recent Put. The purchase price
of the shares of common stock contained in a Put shall be 80 of the lowest traded price of the Company common stock during the ten consecutive 

Trading
Days preceding the date of the Put notice. In the event The Company up lists to Nasdaq or an equivalent national exchange, the purchase
price will be 90 . No Put will be made in an amount less than 10,000 or greater than 500,000 and any single drawdown may not exceed
200 of the average daily trading dollar volume of the Company s common stock during the ten trading days preceding the Put. In
no event is the Company entitled to make a Put or is GHS entitled to purchase and own cumulative shares greater than 4.99 of the Company s

of the common stock, the number of shares outstanding, and the Company s determinations as to the appropriate sources of funding
for the Company and its operations. The net proceeds under the EFA to the Company will depend on the frequency and prices at which the

 September
30, 2024 and 2023 

NOTE 11 GOING CONCERN 

The Company follows FASB ASU 2014-10 
Development Stage Entities because its principal operations have commenced, but there has been no significant revenue therefrom. To date,
the Company's activities since inception have consisted principally of acquiring property, equipment, and other operating assets, raising
capital, starting up production, recruiting and training personnel and raising capital. 

The Company's ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan as well as continuing to develop
its brood stock in order to fulfill recently signed contracts. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
if the business plan cannot be implemented or if additional capital cannot be raised, either of which could result in the Company not
being able to continue as a going concern. 

The Company is in the process of raising additional
capital to support the completion of the developmental stage activities and ramp up ongoing full shrimp harvest cycles and establish its
customer base. Therefore, the Company's activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional
funding to operationalize the Company's current technology. Further, the company is under threat of foreclosure of the farm facilities as described in Note 6. The company
plans to sell certain assets, including portions of the land to pay off debt and fund operations.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain certain forward-looking statements. Historical results may not indicate future
performance. Our forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events; are based on assumptions and are subject to
known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements.
Factors that may cause differences between actual results and those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited
to, those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed
with the SEC on July 2, 2024. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, including any changes
that might result from any facts, events, or circumstances after the date hereof that may bear upon forward-looking statements. Furthermore,
we cannot guarantee future results, events, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The following discussions are based upon our financial
statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP Financial Measures of the United States. 

The preparation of these financial statements
requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosures of contingencies. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the
financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experiences and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and
circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. 

Accounting for Our Shrimp Inventory 

Our inventory of shrimp is divided into shrimp
held for sale and broodstock shrimp. Broodstock are shrimp that are used for breeding purposes; selected for their genetic, disease-free
and size attributes they can be more valuable than shrimp held for sale. We collect broodstock from the biomass just before the harvest
and segregate them from the shrimp that will be harvested and sold. Broodstock, because of their higher value, may be sold to other shrimp
farmers in the United States and overseas. We also keep a number of broodstock for our own restocking purposes. So, during the year, our
inventory can consist of shrimp held for sale, broodstock held for sale and broodstock used for restocking purposes. 

Shrimp farming is a seasonal business. On a calendar
year basis, we typically use the broodstock to breed our larvae shrimp during the first quarter so that by spring the shrimp are held
in large post-larvae tanks for development. Later, in early summer, the shrimp are transferred to ponds where they complete the grow out
process over the next five to nine months. This can vary if we have more than one cycle of shrimp. Grow out may begin in the second in
the second quarter, with a second cycle grow out beginning in early summer. The first harvest cycle can occur in early fall with the second
harvest cycle occurring in November or December. During 2023, we had one cycle and harvest occurred in early November 2023. During 2024,
we have not stocked, nor have we had a harvest; however, we are in process of larval development for broodstock families and line continuation. 

Our shrimp inventory is valued at lower of cost
or the net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. 

The inventory at September 30, 2024 consists of
live broodstock animals. Included in this amount are costs and charges directly and indirectly incurred in bringing shrimp inventory to
its existing condition and location as noted in FASB ASC 330-10-30. 

19 

At September 30, 2024, the broodstock shrimp for
the 2024 harvest had been identified and segregated from consumable shrimp in outdoor ponds to indoor tanks. The table below summarizes
inventory at September 30, 2024 and 2023.

on a pro rata basis of cost per pound of the total biomass of shrimp held for sale. Subsequent costs will be allocated in accordance with
ASC 330-10-30. 

Business Overview 

Founded in 2017, we are a leading aquaculture
company that provides premium quality, farm-raised pacific white shrimp, 100 free of antibiotics and hormones, to the U.S. domestic seafood
market. We believe we are a leading aquaculture company due to Best Aquaculture Practices BAP guidelines, 1 
considering the rarity of the standards in the U.S. Although we are not currently in full compliance with BAP guidelines, we are working
towards full compliance. At the moment, we adhere to BAP guidelines as part of our operating and production model. Grown at our 1,880-acre
farm located in Rio Hondo, Texas, on the largest scale aquaculture farm in the U.S., our shrimp are meticulously raised to exceed in line
with industry best practices according to BAP guidelines 2 using only authentic, sustainable practices. Within our controlled
facility, each harvest is responsibly raised and cultivated onsite with minimal ecological footprint, promising our customers a superior
product developed from the highest standard of care. 

We have and will continue to utilize superior
genetic linage broodstock for cultivation of own post larvae in our onsite genetics, maturation and hatchery facilities. These facilities
allow us to continually develop animals with increasing growth rates, lower mortality, and stronger disease resistance. We began formal
production runs in 2018 and to date have produced almost one million lbs. of shrimp for consumption. 

Recent trends in the shrimp industry, including
that, according to preliminary 2023 data from the National Marine Fisheries Service, shrimp prices have dropped as much as 44 since 2022. 3 
Our business, prospects, revenues, profitability, and future growth are highly dependent upon the prices of and demand for shrimp. Our
ability to borrow and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also substantially dependent upon shrimp prices. These prices
have been and are likely to continue to be extremely volatile for seasonal, cyclical, and other reasons. Any substantial or extended decline
in the price of shrimp will have a material adverse effect on our financing capacity and our prospects for commencing and sustaining any
economic commercial production. In addition, increased availability of imported shrimp can affect our business by lowering commodity prices.
This could reduce the value of inventories, held both by us and by our customers, and cause many of our customers to reduce their orders
for new products until they can dispose of their higher-cost inventories.

Going Concern Uncertainty 

As shown in the accompanying financial statements,
during the three-months ended September 30, 2024, we reported a net loss of 575,325. As of September 30, 2024, our current liabilities
exceeded its current assets by 4,777,659. As of September 30, 2024, we had 0 cash. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we reported
a net loss of 1,971,551. As of December 31, 2023, our current liabilities exceeded its current assets by 3,554,981. As of December
31, 2023, we had 6,600 cash. 

We will require additional funding to finance
the growth of our operations and achieve our strategic objectives. These factors, as relative to capital raising activities, create doubt
as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We are seeking to raise additional capital and are targeting strategic partners to
accelerate the sales and marketing of our products and begin generating revenues. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon the success of future capital offerings or alternative financing arrangements, expansion of our operations and generating sales.
The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going
concern. Management is actively pursuing additional sources of financing sufficient to generate enough cash flow to fund its operations;
however, management cannot make any assurances that such financing will be secured. 

Results of Operations for the Three-Months
Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenues 

For the three-months ended September 30, 2024,
total revenues were 0 compared to 0 for the same period in 2023. In 2023, the Company focused efforts primarily on the development of
genetic lines in the first half of the year and did not produce a meaning full harvest until the end of the year. 

Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 

For the three-months ended September 30, 2024,
cost of goods sold was 196,552 compared to 400,000 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 203,448 or 51 . This was the result of
less inventory written off during the current three months ended September 30, 2024. 

There was no gross margin for the three-months
ended September 30, 2024 and for the same period in 2023. 

Operating Expenses

ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 33,417, or 13 , to 213,250 from 246,667 for the three-months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease
in expenses resulted from less legal and professional fees and payroll wages, the primary components, being approximately the same. 

Other Income (Expense)

we had interest expenses of 175,836 compared to interest expenses of 121,551 for the same period in 2023, an increase in interest expense
of 54,285. This increase in interest expense was due primarily to three new notes.

As a result of the above, we reported a net loss
of 575,325 for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 768,218 for the three-months ended September 30,
2023.

2024. 

Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 

For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024,
cost of goods sold was 419,851 compared to 400,000 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 19,851 or 5 . This was the result of
sales of shrimp during the current nine months ended September 30, 2024.

period September 30, 2023 and for the same period in 2023. 

Operating Expenses 

General and administrative expenses for nine-months
ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 57,609, or 10 , to 534,633 from 592,242 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023. These nearly
equivalent expenses resulted from legal and professional fees and payroll wages, the primary components, being approximately the same. 

Other Income (Expense) 

For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024,
we had interest expenses of 449,356 compared to interest expenses of 358,925 for the same period in 2023, an increase in interest expense
of 90,431. This increase in interest expense was due primarily to three new notes.

2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance
of 0, compared to a balance of 6,600 at December 31, 2023. We currently do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations for the next
12 months and we will require working capital to complete development and production, testing and marketing of our products and to pay
for ongoing operating expenses. We anticipate adding management positions for corporate development and the corresponding operations of
the Company, but this will not occur prior to obtaining additional capital. Currently, competitively priced loans from banks or other
lending sources for lines of credit or similar short-term borrowings are not available to us. We have been able to raise working capital
to fund operations through the issuances of convertible preferred stock to GHS, factoring our receivables, and borrowing funds from employees
of the Company. As of September 30, 2024, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by 4,777,659 as compared to December 31,
2023, when current liabilities exceeded current assets by 3,554,981, an increase of 1,222,678. 

22 

Our liquidity is significantly impacted by the
farm note to King s Aqua Farm LLC, dated June 15, 2017, in the original amount of 5,600,000 bearing interest at 6.0 per annum,
due in 2039, yielding a monthly payment of 38,687. Secured by the farm property, the outstanding principal balance at both September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2923, was 4,707,902. On May 31, 2024, the Company entered into a Forbearance and Modification Agreement with
the lender. Under the agreement, the lender agreed that it would not exercise or enforce its rights or remedies against the Company to
which it would be entitled under the terms of the Real Estate Lien Note dated June 15, 2017 in the original principal amount of 5,600,000,
and the Deed of Trust executed by the Company as grantor in favor of Jizhong Wang, as trustee, for the benefit of the lender by occurrence
of the failure by the Company to pay principal and interest installments from May 1, 2023 through May 31, 2024 before August 6, 2024.
The forbearance was conditioned on the obligation of the Company to pay the lender 77,375, which was paid. At September 30, 2024, the
Company is in default for 4,845,024 including principal and interest due to failure to remit timely monthly payments. On October 25,
2024, the Company signed a Deed in Lieu of where the lender agrees to forbear from exercising its rights to foreclosure take position
of the property secured by the loan on or prior to November 30, 2024. If by December 1, 2024, the full amount of the debt has not been
paid, the lender will proceed to either record the Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure or pursue to take possession of the property. 

The Company is also a party to an SBA Loan through
a bank in the original amount of 150,000 bearing interest at 3.75 per annum, due in 2050, yielding a monthly payment amount of 731. 

Liquidity
is also affected by notes to our shareholders. At September 30, 2024, shareholders have loaned the Company approximately 1,642,598 which
notes accrue interest at ranging from 12.0 to 18 per annum and were due March 31, 2024. The Company extended this due date to July 1,
2024, and plans to extend it again to January 1, 2025 . Current
discussions with noteholders are underway and, although an extension is not certain, we expect the noteholders to agree to this extension.
Until an extension is agreed, the notes are in default. 

In
February 2024, the Company signed an unsecured promissory note with a lender for 111,600, bearing one-time interest at the rate of 13 ,
and maturing on four dates beginning on August 30, 2024 and ending on November 30, 2024. The proceeds of this note were issued with an
original issue discount of 18,600, yielding net proceeds of 88,000. Upon full maturity, the Company will have paid a total of 126,108
of principal and interest on this note. 

In
August 2024, the Company signed an unsecured promissory note with a lender for 82,800 bearing one-time interest at the rate of 13 , and
maturing on four dates beginning in February 2025 and ending on May 2025. The proceeds of this note were issued with an original issue
discount of 13,800 and loan cost 6,000, yielding net proceeds of 63,000. Upon full maturity, the Company will have paid a total of
 93,564 of principal and interest on this note. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

During
the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 442,196 due mainly to a net loss of 1,143,656, increase
in accounts payable and accrued expense of 613,243 due to increased operations, and increase in accrued interest expense due mainly to
falling into arrears on the note payable covering our farm property and increased interest expense on notes payable to shareholders. 

By comparison, during the nine-months ended September
30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 824,548 resulting mainly from a net operating loss of 1,322,481 and increased inventory
levels of 242,641, offset by increases in accrued interest of 267,991. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024,
we had 7,494 net cash provided by investing activities. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2023, we had 15,132 of net cash used
in investing activities. This increase is mainly due to sale of property and equipment. 

23 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024,
net cash provided by financing activities was 428,102 which was mainly comprised of proceeds from notes payable of 506,000, offset by
payments due to shareholders of 74,375, and notes payable of 74,243. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided
by financing activities was 908,667 which was mainly comprised of proceeds from 958,000 from issued Series D Preferred Stock to GHS,
offset by 116,488 in payments on related party notes and 56,258 in notes payable as well as proceeds from shareholder notes of 123,700. 

Factors That May Affect Future Results 

Management s Discussion and Analysis contains
information based on management s beliefs and forward-looking statements that involve several risks, uncertainties, and assumptions.
There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,
including but not limited to, our ability to obtain the equity/debt funding or borrowings necessary to produce, market and launch our
products, our ability to successfully serially produce and market our products; our success establishing and maintaining production lines;
the acceptance of our products by customers; our continued ability to pay operating costs; our ability to meet demand for our products;
the amount and nature of competition from our competitors; the effects of technological changes on products and product demand; and our
ability to successfully adapt to market forces and technological demands of our customers. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

We have provided a discussion of recent accounting
pronouncements in NOTE 2 to the Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements for September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company, the Company has
elected not to provide the disclosure required by this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have established disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC and, as such, is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
Adam Thomas, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Mr. Thomas has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on his evaluation, Mr. Thomas concluded that, due to a material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30,
2024. In light of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, we completed substantive procedures, including validating
the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used for accounting prior to filing this Form 10-Q. 

These additional procedures have allowed us to
conclude that, notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the consolidated financial statements
included in this Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There has been no change in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act, during our quarter ended September 30, 2024,
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
