The future viability of the Company is dependent on the Company s ability to generate cash flows from the sales of the Company s product candidates, such as AXPAXLI, if and as approved, and the sales of DEXTENZA, and to raise additional capital to finance its operations. The Company will need to finance its operations through public or private securities offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing agreements, royalty agreements, or marketing and distribution agreements. Although the Company has been successful in raising capital in the past, there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. If the Company is unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, in sufficient amounts, or at all, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs for product candidates, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, any of which could adversely affect its business prospects, or the Company may be unable to continue operations.

The Conversion Option Derivative Liability was recorded at fair value upon the issuance of the Convertible Notes and was subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting period. The Conversion Option Derivative Liability was initially valued and was subsequently remeasured using a with-and-without method. The with-and-without methodology involves valuing the whole instrument on an as-is basis with the embedded conversion option and then valuing the instrument without the embedded conversion option. The difference between the entire instrument with the embedded conversion option compared to the instrument without the embedded conversion option is the fair value of the derivative, recorded as the Conversion Option Derivative Liability. Refer to Note 9 for details regarding the determination of fair value.

The estimated fair value of the Barings Credit Facility, without the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability, was at September 30, 2024. At December 31, 2023, the Barings Credit Facility, net of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability, was carried at amortized cost totaling comprised of the non-current liability (Note 7) and accrued interest (Note 6). The estimated fair value of the Barings Credit Facility, without the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability, was at December 31, 2023. The fair value of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The use of this approach requires the use of Level 3 unobservable inputs. The main inputs when determining the fair value of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability are the amount and timing of the expected future revenue of the Company, the estimated volatility of these revenues, and the discount rate corresponding to the risk of revenue.

 , comprised of the non-current liability (Note 7) and accrued interest (Note 6). The fair value of the Convertible Notes with and without the conversion option as of December 31, 2023 was estimated using a binomial lattice approach. The use of this approach required the use of Level 3 unobservable inputs. The main input when determining the fair value of the Convertible Notes was the bond yield that pertained to the host instrument without the conversion option. The significant assumption used in determining the bond yield was the market yield movements of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date, which was assessed and updated each period. The main input when determining the fair value for disclosure purposes was the bond yield which was updated each period to reflect the yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date. The fair value of the Conversion Option Derivative Liability immediately before the Conversion was determined based on the intrinsic value of the separated conversion option. shares to shares. On February 21, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement with certain institutional accredited investors (the Investors ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to the Investors in a private placement an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share (the Shares ), at a price of per share, and, to certain Investors in lieu of Shares, pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock (the Pre-Funded Warrants ), at a price of per Pre-Funded Warrant (the 2024 Private Placement ). Each Pre-Funded Warrant issued in the 2024 Private Placement has an exercise price of per share, is currently exercisable and will remain exercisable until the Pre-Funded Warrant is exercised in full. The 2024 Private Placement closed on February 26, 2024. The Company received total net proceeds from the 2024 Private Placement of approximately after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Overview Our Company We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving vision in the real world through the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for retinal diseases and other eye conditions. AXPAXLI (axitinib intravitreal implant, also known as OTX-TKI), our product candidate for retinal disease, is based on our ELUTYX proprietary bioresorbable hydrogel-based formulation technology. AXPAXLI is currently in two Phase 3 clinical trials for wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, which we refer to as the SOL-1 trial and the SOL-R trial, respectively. We have also completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of AXPAXLI for the treatment of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or NPDR, which we refer to as the HELIOS trial. Our pipeline also leverages the ELUTYX technology in our commercial product DEXTENZA, a corticosteroid approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery and ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis, and in our product candidate PAXTRAVA (travoprost intracameral implant also known as OTX-TIC), which is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, or OAG, or ocular hypertension, or OHT. Key Business and Financial Developments AXPAXLI for wet AMD We are currently conducting the SOL-1 trial, a registrational Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of wet AMD. The SOL-1 trial is designed as a prospective, multi-center, randomized, parallel-group trial that involves over 100 trial sites located in the U.S. and Argentina. The SOL-1 trial is designed as a superiority trial comparing a single optimized implant of AXPAXLI with a drug load of 450 g of axitinib to a single injection of aflibercept 2 mg and assessing the safety and efficacy of AXPAXLI in subjects with wet AMD by measuring Best Corrected Visual Accuity, or BCVA, and central subfield thickness. We are conducting the SOL-1 trial in accordance with a Special Protocol Agreement, or SPA, letter we received in October 2023 from the FDA regarding the proposed clinical trial protocol and the statistical analysis plan and a subsequent SPA modification letter we received from the FDA in January 2024 regarding the formulation of AXPAXLI to be used and the trial s inclusion criteria. The SOL-1 trial is intended to randomize approximately 300 evaluable treatment-na ve subjects with a diagnosis of wet AMD in the study eye with good visual acuity and a diagnosis of macular choroidal neovascularization at screening. Under the study protocol, after initial screening, enrolled subjects in the trial will receive two aflibercept 2 mg loading doses between the screening visit and Day 1: one at Week -8 and another at Week -4. Subjects reaching approximately 20/20 vision or experiencing an improvement of 10 Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study, or ETDRS, letters after these injections, in addition to satisfying other criteria, will then be randomized in the trial at Day 1 to receive either one implant of AXPAXLI in the investigational arm or one injection of aflibercept 2 mg in the control arm. Those subjects who fail randomization will then be eligible to be enrolled in the SOL-R trial. All subjects who are successfully randomized in the SOL-1 trial will then be followed every month and rescued as needed with supplemental anti-VEGF treatment based on pre-specified criteria. The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects who maintain visual acuity, defined as a BCVA loss of less than 15 letters on the ETDRS chart at week 36. Our pre-specified rescue criteria are a loss of 15 or more letters on the ETDRS chart compared to baseline, or a new hemorrhage that is deemed to be likely to 

 22

 cause irreversible vision loss. A loss of 15 letters or more on the ETDRS chart at any time in the trial would be considered as having met the endpoint as a treatment failure. The first subjects in the SOL-1 trial were screened and received their first loading aflibercept 2 mg injections in February 2024, and we started randomizing subjects in April 2024. During our Investor Day on June 13, 2024, we announced that, as of June 7, 2024, we had 60 active trial sites and 151 subjects enrolled in various stages of loading and randomization. As of November 14, 2024, we have activated over 100 trial sites. We expect the SOL-1 trial to be fully enrolled with all subjects randomized by the end of 2024 and to present topline data from the SOL-1 trial during the fourth quarter of 2025. In June 2024, we initiated the SOL-R trial, a repeat-dosing registrational Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of wet AMD. The SOL-R trial is designed as a multi-center, double-masked, randomized (2:2:1), three-arm trial that will involve sites located in the U.S. and the rest of the world. The trial is intended to randomize approximately 825 subjects that are either treatment na ve or have been diagnosed with wet AMD within three months prior to enrollment in the study eye. This non-inferiority trial reflects a patient enrichment strategy that includes five loading doses of aflibercept 2 mg and monitoring to exclude those subjects with significant retinal fluid fluctuations. In the first arm, subjects will receive a single dose of AXPAXLI at Day 1 and be re-dosed at Week 24. In the second arm, subjects will receive aflibercept 2 mg on-label every 8 weeks. In the third arm, subjects will receive a single dose of aflibercept 8 mg (Eylea HD), at Day 1 and will be re-dosed at Week 24, aligned with the AXPAXLI dosing regimen in the first arm and serving as adequate masking pursuant to FDA guidance. The clinical trial protocol requires that, during the trial, subjects in any arm meeting pre-specified rescue criteria will receive a supplemental dose of aflibercept 2 mg. The primary endpoint is non-inferiority in mean BCVA change from baseline between the AXPAXLI and on-label aflibercept 2 mg arms at one year. The first subjects were enrolled in the SOL-R trial in July 2024. Initially, subjects enrolled in the SOL-R trial included only subjects that constituted loading or randomization failures from the SOL-1 trial. On November 14, 2024, we announced that, as the SOL-1 trial nears the completion of randomization, trial sites can now directly enroll eligible subjects into the SOL-R trial. In August 2024, we received a Type C written response in which the FDA agreed that the SOL-R clinical trial is appropriate as an adequate and well-controlled trial in support of a potential NDA and product label. The FDA also noted that the use of one superiority trial and one non-inferiority trial is generally acceptable as the basis of an eventual NDA in wet AMD. If we were to obtain favorable results from the SOL-1 trial and the SOL-R trial, we plan to submit an NDA with the FDA for marketing approval of AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD. AXPAXLI for NPDR We have completed the HELIOS trial, a U.S.-based, multicenter, double-masked, randomized, parallel group Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a single injection of AXPAXLI in subjects with moderately severe to severe NPDR without diabetic macular edema, subject to finalization of the clinical study report, or CSR. We started conducting the HELIOS trial initially under an exploratory IND, which was subsequently converted to a traditional IND. We enrolled 22 subjects with diabetic retinopathy secondary to type 1 or type 2 diabetes who had not had an anti-VEGF injection in the prior 12 months or diabetic macular edema in the prior six months, randomized 2:1 to either a single implant of AXPAXLI containing 600 g of axitinib or sham control. One subject dropped out from the HELIOS trial for reasons unrelated to the trial. In June 2024, we announced topline data from the HELIOS trial at 48 weeks. AXPAXLI was generally well-tolerated and did not result in any reported incidence of intraocular inflammation, iritis, vitritis, or vasculitis. No subjects in either arm received rescue medication. At week 48, six of 13 (46.2 subjects in the AXPAXLI group experienced either a 1- or 2-step improvement in the Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale, or DRSS, with three of the 13 (23.1 experiencing a 2-step improvement. No subjects in the control group showed a 1-step or greater improvement at the same timepoint. No subjects in the AXPAXLI group experienced any worsening in DRSS. Two of eight (25.0 subjects in the control group experienced worsening in the DRSS at 48 weeks. No subjects in the AXPAXLI group developed proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or PDR, or center-involved diabetic macular edema, or CI-DME at week 48. Three of eight (37.5 subjects in the control group developed PDR or CI-DME at the same timepoint. On average, subjects in the AXPAXLI arm showed improvement in mean central subfield thickness versus baseline compared to the control group, which showed worsening at the 48-week timepoint.

 We plan to request a meeting with the FDA to discuss the results of the HELIOS trial and seek guidance as to the regulatory requirements regarding the further clinical development of AXPAXLI for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. We are also developing a potential next-generation injector that we believe could improve the administration of AXPAXLI to the eye. PAXTRAVA We are conducting a U.S.-based Phase 2 prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of PAXTRAVA for the treatment of subjects with primary OAG or OHT under an IND. The Phase 2 clinical trial was initially designed to include approximately 105 subjects at 15 to 20 sites between three arms of approximately 35 subjects each to evaluate two formulations of PAXTRAVA for the treatment of OAG or OHT in subjects compared to DURYSTA. The non-study eye of each subject receives a topical prostaglandin analog daily, if not contraindicated. The primary efficacy endpoint is measured by diurnal intraocular pressure, or IOP, mean change from baseline (8 a.m., 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) at 2, 6 and 12 weeks. The active comparator control arm receives one injection of DURYSTA in one eye and a topical prostaglandin analog daily in the non-study eye, if not contraindicated. In April 2024, we presented 6-month topline data from this Phase 2 clinical trial at the 2024 American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery Annual Meeting. In the trial, the PAXTRAVA 26 g single implant demonstrated consistent control of IOP, through six months, as statistically significant IOP changes from baseline were observed for every individual and mean diurnal measurement at primary endpoints Week 2 (M0.5), Week 6 (M1.5), and Week 12 (M3), as well as secondary endpoints Months 4.5 and 6 (p PAXTRAVA 26 g was generally well tolerated with no impact on the corneal endothelium having been observed at six months following a single administration of the product candidate. The majority of adverse events, or AEs, observed were mild in severity and generally resolved with topical medical treatment. Most ocular AEs within three days were deemed related to the injection procedure by the investigators. AEs observed more than three days post-injection procedure were consistent with the travoprost label. There was one serious AE in the trial, where an implant required removal, which the investigator assessed to be likely due to a peri-implantation bacterial infection. Consistent bioresorption of the implant coupled with the durable effect observed in the Phase 2 trial suggests redosing could be possible without the risk of stacking implants. We are conducting a pilot repeat-dose sub-study in the Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety of a repeat, sustained-release dose in a small subset of subjects with OAG or OHT. Once we have completed the pilot repeat-dose sub-study, we plan to seek an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and to determine our next steps for PAXTRAVA for the treatment of OAG or OHT following that meeting. We are also developing a potential next-generation injector that we believe could improve the administration of therapy. Commercial Our net product revenue is generated from the sale of DEXTENZA to specialty distributors, or SDs, for resale to certain ambulatory surgery centers, or ASCs, certain hospital outpatient departments, or HOPDs, and certain physicians offices, and from the direct sale by us to ASCs and physicians offices. Our net product revenue was 15.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting an increase of 0.3 million or 2.7 over the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a decrease of 1.0 million or 6.5 over the three months ended June 30, 2024. Our net product revenue was 46.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting an increase of 3.2 million or 7.5 over the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In-Market Sales, defined as unit sales from the SDs to ASCs, HOPDs, and physicians offices, and unit sales made directly by us to ASCs and physicians offices, exceeded 42,000 units in the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of more than 6,000 units compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and an increase of nearly 1,000 units compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. Differences between the development of DEXTENZA s

 product revenue, net as recognized in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and In-Market Sales figures are attributable to distributor stocking patterns. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. par. 1395 et seq., or the Medicare Statute, physician administered non-opioid pain medications will receive separate payment in both the ASC and HOPD settings of care beginning January 1, 2025. The Medicare Statute allows for continued separate payment of DEXTENZA in the ASC setting for 2025, and it re-establishes the separate payment of DEXTENZA in the HOPD setting that was lost for 2024. Additionally, the Medicare Statute limits the separate payment for physician administered non-opioid pain medications. In November 2024, the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services, or CMS, released the final Outpatient Prospective Payment System Rule for the calendar year 2025, or the CY 2025 OPPS Rule, including the maximum Medicare payment for DEXTENZA. In June 2024, we submitted the CSR for our clinical trial to evaluate DEXTENZA in pediatric subjects following cataract surgery to the FDA. We anticipate receiving the FDA s decision on the pediatric labeling for DEXTENZA during the second quarter of 2025. Reduction in Force In May 2024, our board of directors approved a strategic reduction in force to eliminate 37 full-time employees, primarily in research and development and technical operations and representing approximately 13 of our workforce, as part of an initiative to prioritize our resources on the clinical development of AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD, or the Strategic Restructuring. We substantially completed the Strategic Restructuring and recorded the related restructuring charges of 1.6 million, resulting primarily from garden leaves and severance benefits, in the three months ended June 30, 2024. We paid all previously accrued restructuring charges in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 2024 Private Placement In February 2024, we sold in a private placement 32,413,560 shares of our common stock at 7.52 per share and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 10,805,957 shares of our common stock at a price of 7.519 per pre-funded warrant for total net proceeds to us of approximately 316.4 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses, or the 2024 Private Placement. Each pre-funded warrant has an exercise price of 0.001 per share, is currently exercisable and will remain exercisable until exercised in full. Convertible Notes In March 2024, the holder of our 37.5 million unsecured senior subordinated convertible notes, or the Convertible Notes, converted the principal amount of the Convertible Notes, and we issued to the holder of the Convertible Notes 5,769,232 shares of our common stock with a total fair value of 52.5 million and paid 11.4 million for accrued interest. The accounting for the extinguishment of the Convertible Notes resulted in a non-cash loss of 28.0 million. Components of our Financial Performance Revenue We recognize product revenue when we sell DEXTENZA in the United States to a network of SDs who then resell the product to ASCs, HOPDs, and physicians offices, and when we sell DEXTENZA on a direct basis to a small number of ASCs and physicians offices. We record DEXTENZA product sales net of estimated chargebacks, rebates, distribution fees and product returns. These deductions are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions. Operating Expenses Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue consists of costs of DEXTENZA product revenue, which include: Direct materials costs; 

 25 

Table of Contents 
 Royalties; Direct labor, which includes employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and payroll taxes, and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in the production process; Manufacturing overhead costs, which includes rent, depreciation, and indirect labor costs associated with the production process; Transportation costs; and Cost of scrap material. 
 Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include: expenses incurred in connection with the clinical trials of our product candidates, including with the investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs; employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and payroll taxes, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development, clinical and regulatory and other related functions; expenses relating to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to the FDA for our submissions for product approvals; expenses associated with developing our pre-commercial manufacturing capabilities and manufacturing clinical study materials; ongoing research and development activities relating to our core bioresorbable hydrogel technology and improvements to this technology; facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; costs relating to the supply and manufacturing of product inventory, prior to approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies of our products; and expenses associated with preclinical development activities. 
 We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical trials and regulatory fees. We do not allocate employee and contractor-related costs, costs associated with our proprietary bioresorbable hydrogel-based formulation technology ELUTYX, costs related to manufacturing or purchasing clinical trial materials, and facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources in combination with third-party CROs, including clinical monitors and clinical research associates, to manage our clinical trials, monitor patient enrollment and perform data analysis for many of our clinical trials. These employees work across multiple development programs and, therefore, we do not track their costs by program.

Table of Contents 
 The successful development and commercialization of our products or product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of: the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our clinical trials and other research and development activities; the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals; the efficacy and potential advantages of our products or product candidates compared to alternative treatments, including any standard of care; the market acceptance of our products or product candidates; and significant and changing government regulation. 
 Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in clinical and preclinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate. We anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase in the future as we support our continued development of our product candidates. Selling and Marketing Expenses Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in selling and marketing functions as well as consulting, advertising and promotion costs. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, information technology, human resources and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include insurance, facility-related costs and professional fees for legal, patent, consulting and accounting and audit services. Other Income (Expense) Interest Expense . Interest expense is incurred on our debt. In August 2023, we entered into a credit and security agreement, or the Barings Credit Agreement, with Barings Finance LLC, or Barings, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, providing for a secured term loan facility, or the Barings Credit Facility, in the aggregate principal amount of 82.5 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our interest-bearing debt included the Barings Credit Facility 82.5 million outstanding principal). For the three months ended September 30, 2023, our interest-bearing debt included the Barings Credit Facility (from August 2, 2023), the Convertible Notes, and our obligations under a credit and security agreement with MidCap Financial Trust, as administrative agent, and other lenders that we entered into in 2014, or, as amended, the MidCap Credit Agreement, establishing a credit facility, or the MidCap Credit Facility 25.0 million outstanding principal through August 2, 2023, no outstanding principal thereafter). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our interest-bearing debt included the Barings Credit Facility and the Convertible Notes (through March 28, 2024, no outstanding principal thereafter). For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our interest-bearing debt included the Barings Credit Facility (from August 2, 2023), the Convertible Notes, and our obligations under the MidCap Credit Facility (through August 2, 2023). Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities. In August 2023, in connection with entering into the Barings Credit Agreement, we identified an embedded derivative liability, which we were required to measure at fair value at inception

 and then are required to measure at the end of each reporting period until the embedded derivative is settled. In 2019, in connection with the issuance of our Convertible Notes, we identified an embedded derivative liability, which we were required to measure at fair value at inception and then at the end of each reporting period until the embedded derivative was settled. The settlement of the derivative liability related to the Convertible Notes occurred on March 28, 2024. The changes in fair value of these derivative liabilities are recorded through the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss and are presented under the caption change in fair value of derivative liabilities . Gains and Losses on Extinguishment of Debt . In March 2024, the holder of the Convertible Notes converted the Convertible Notes. In connection with the conversion, our obligations under the Convertible Notes extinguished, resulting in a loss on extinguishment. Results of Operations Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) (in thousands) Revenue: Product revenue, net 15,347 14,950 397 Collaboration revenue 78 131 (53) Total revenue, net 15,425 15,081 344 Costs and operating expenses: Cost of product revenue 1,561 1,377 184 Research and development 37,054 15,019 22,035 Selling and marketing 10,573 9,315 1,258 General and administrative 12,235 8,584 3,651 Total costs and operating expenses 61,423 34,295 27,128 Loss from operations (45,998) (19,214) (26,784) Other income (expense): Interest income 5,653 1,212 4,441 Interest expense (3,224) (3,426) 202 Change in fair value of derivative liabilities 7,076 6,722 354 Gains on extinguishment of debt, net 14,190 (14,190) Total other income (expense), net 9,505 18,698 (9,193) Net loss (36,493) (516) (35,977) Product Revenue, net Our product revenue, net was 15.3 million and 15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of 0.3 million year-over-year. All of our product revenue, net, was attributable to sales of DEXTENZA. Our total gross-to-net provisions, or GTN Provisions, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 39.0 and 29.8 , respectively, of gross DEXTENZA product sales. Effective October 2024, we increased the wholesale acquisition cost, or WAC, and we concurrently increased the off-invoice discount, or OID, for DEXTENZA as part of our overall pricing strategy. The OID amounts are generally determined at the time of resale by SD or direct sales to ASCs or physicians offices by us. The total GTN Provisions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 includes timing effects related to this increase, as units that we sold to SDs under the pre-October 2024 OID will be subject to the increased OID to the extent that such units are subsequently sold as In-Market Sales. We expect that the GTN Provisions relative to gross DEXTENZA product sales will increase as a result of this change and any additional anticipated OID increases, and we expect that GTN Provisions relative to gross DEXTENZA product sales will remain at an elevated level for 2024 and beyond.

 Collaboration Revenue During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 0.1 million of collaboration revenue related to the performance obligation under our license agreement with AffaMed to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial of PAXTRAVA, compared to 0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. We recognize collaboration revenue based on a cost-to-cost method. Research and Development Expenses 

Three Months Ended September 30, Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) (in thousands) Direct research and development expenses by program: AXPAXLI for wet AMD 17,017 2,077 14,940 AXPAXLI for NPDR 244 652 (408) PAXTRAVA for OAG or OHT 314 650 (336) DEXTENZA for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain 457 606 (149) OTX-DED for the short-term treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease 70 266 (196) OTX-CSI for treatment of dry eye disease 6 (6) Preclinical programs 99 217 (118) Unallocated expenses: Personnel costs 10,104 6,407 3,697 All other costs 8,749 4,138 4,611 Total research and development expenses 37,054 15,019 22,035 Research and development expenses were 37.1 million and 15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of 22.1 million year-over-year. Within research and development expenses, expenses for clinical programs increased 13.8 million, unallocated expenses increased 8.3 million, and expenses for preclinical programs decreased 0.1 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 18.2 million in direct research and development expenses for our products and product candidates compared to 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 13.7 million is primarily related to timing and conduct of our clinical trials of AXPAXLI for wet AMD, including the SOL-1 trial and the SOL-R trial, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with the HELIOS clinical trial which we have completed, subject to finalization of the CSR, and our Phase 2 clinical trial of PAXTRAVA as we shifted to the smaller repeat dose sub-study. We expect that direct research and development expenses for our products and product candidates will increase significantly for the remainder of 2024 and beyond as we progress with the SOL-1 trial and the SOL-R trial; complete our other ongoing clinical trials; and initiate any other clinical trials of our product candidates that we might determine in the future to conduct, partially offset by reduced costs related to preclinical programs as a result of the Strategic Restructuring. We expect that personnel costs will increase for the remainder of 2024 and beyond, as we have recently strengthened and continue to strengthen our leadership team and our clinical teams dedicated to the SOL-1 and SOL-R trials with the addition of several retinal disease experts and other key professionals. The anticipated increase will be partially offset by reduced personnel costs as a result of the Strategic Restructuring.

 Selling and Marketing Expenses Three Months Ended September 30, Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) (in thousands) Personnel-related (including stock-based compensation) 6,869 6,591 278 Professional fees 2,453 1,715 738 Facility-related and other 1,251 1,009 242 Total selling and marketing expenses 10,573 9,315 1,258 Selling and marketing expenses were 10.6 million and 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of 1.3 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in professional fees of 0.7 million; an increase in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, of 0.3 million; and an increase in facility-related and other costs of 0.2 million. We expect our selling and marketing expenses to remain stable or increase slightly for the remainder of 2024 and beyond as we continue to support the commercialization of DEXTENZA. General and Administrative Expenses Three Months Ended September 30, Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) (in thousands) Personnel-related (including stock-based compensation) 6,606 5,313 1,293 Professional fees 4,390 2,575 1,815 Facility-related and other 1,239 696 543 Total general and administrative expenses 12,235 8,584 3,651 General and administrative expenses were 12.2 million and 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of 3.6 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in professional fees of 1.8 million, an increase of 1.3 million in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, and an increase of 0.5 million in facility-related and other costs. We anticipate that the level of our general and administrative expenses may continue to increase for the remainder of 2024 and beyond, as we have recently strengthened, and as we continue to further strengthen, our leadership team and other certain functions that support our clinical trials of AXPAXLI, including the SOL-1 trial and the SOL-R trial, and our business in general.

 Other Income (Expense), Net Interest Income . Interest income was 5.7 million and 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of 4.5 million year-over-year. The increase is primarily due to a higher average balance of cash and cash equivalents held by us, and higher interest rates. Interest Expense . Interest expense was 3.2 million and 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting a decrease of 0.2 million year-over-year. Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities. We recognized a non-cash gain from the change in fair values of our derivative liabilities of 7.1 million and 6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is comprised of a gain of 7.6 million from the change in the fair value of the derivative liability related to the Barings Credit Agreement, partially offset by a 0.5 million expense related to royalty fees under the Barings Credit Agreement that we paid or accrued. The gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is comprised of a gain of 7.1 million, net, from the changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities related to the Barings Credit Agreement and the Convertible Notes, partially offset by a 0.4 million expense related to royalty fees under the Barings Credit Agreement that we paid or accrued. We cannot predict how the fair value of the derivative liability related to the Barings Credit Agreement will change in 2024 and beyond. Gains and Losses on Extinguishment of Debt, Net . Gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, net, were 0 million and 14.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In August 2023, we amended the Convertible Notes, or the Convertible Notes Amendment, and accounted for the Convertible Notes Amendment as an extinguishment of debt in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 470-50 Debt. Application of this accounting standard resulted in a non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of 14.9 million. In August 2023, we also extinguished our obligations under the MidCap Credit Agreement, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 0.7 million. Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) (in thousands) Revenue: Product revenue, net 46,441 43,193 3,248 Collaboration revenue 200 449 (249) Total revenue, net 46,641 43,642 2,999 Costs and operating expenses: Cost of product revenue 4,396 3,895 501 Research and development 86,646 44,860 41,786 Selling and marketing 30,750 31,304 (554) General and administrative 46,054 25,915 20,139 Total costs and operating expenses 167,846 105,974 61,872 Loss from operations (121,205) (62,332) (58,873) Other income (expense): Interest income 15,611 2,524 13,087 Interest expense (10,471) (7,187) (3,284) Change in fair value of derivative liabilities (1,103) 1,290 (2,393) Gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, net (27,950) 14,190 (42,140) Other expense, net (1) 1 Total other income, net (23,913) 10,816 (34,729) Net loss (145,118) (51,516) (93,602)

 Product Revenue, net Our product revenue, net was 46.4 million and 43.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of 3.2 million year-over-year. All of our product revenue, net, was attributable to sales of DEXTENZA. Our total GTN Provisions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 38.3 and 29.2 , respectively, of gross DEXTENZA product sales. Effective April 2024, we increased the WAC for DEXTENZA and the OID. Effective October 2024, we increased the WAC and the OID for DEXTENZA as part of our overall pricing strategy further. The OID amounts are generally determined at the time of resale by SDs or direct sales to ASCs and physicians offices by us. The total GTN Provisions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include timing effects related to these increases, as units that we sold to SDs under the previously effective WACs and OIDs will be subject to the increased OID to the extent that such units are sold as In-Market Sales after the respective increases came into effect. The increase in the WAC and the increases in the OID have resulted in an elevation of the level of the GTN Provisions relative to gross DEXTENZA product sales compared to periods prior to the increase in the WAC and the OID. We expect that GTN Provisions relative to gross DEXTENZA product sales will further increase for 2024 and beyond based on these changes and any additional anticipated OID increases. Collaboration Revenue We recognized 0.2 million of collaboration revenue related to the performance obligation under our license agreement with AffaMed to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial of PAXTRAVA during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We recognize collaboration revenue based on a cost-to-cost method. Research and Development Expenses

Within research and development expenses, expenses for clinical programs increased 29.0 million, unallocated expenses increased 13.0 million, and expenses for preclinical programs decreased 0.2 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 42.0 million in direct research and development expenses for our products and product candidates compared to 13.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 28.8 million is primarily related to timing and conduct of our clinical trials of AXPAXLI, including the SOL-1 trial and the SOL-R trial, partially offset by reduced development activities related to our Phase 2 clinical trial of PAXTRAVA as we shifted to the smaller repeat dose sub-study.

The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, of 0.5 million and a decrease in professional fees of 0.1 million; partially offset by an increase in facility-related and other costs of 0.1 million. We expect our selling and marketing expenses to remain stable or increase slightly for the remainder of 2024 and beyond as we continue to support the commercialization of DEXTENZA. General and Administrative Expenses 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) (in thousands) Personnel-related (including stock-based compensation) 31,038 16,455 14,583 Professional fees 12,142 8,218 3,924 Facility-related and other 2,874 1,242 1,632 Total general and administrative expenses 46,054 25,915 20,139 General and administrative expenses were 46.1 million and 25.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of 20.2 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 14.6 million in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, an increase in professional fees of 3.9 million, and an increase of 1.6 million in facility-related and other costs. Personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include 1.6 million related to wages, severance, and other benefits under the Strategic Restructuring, and 9.9 million related to accrued severance and acceleration of stock-based compensation for certain employees who departed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 separate from the Strategic Restructuring, including our former Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Business Officer, and our former Chief Medical Officer. We anticipate that the level of our general and administrative expenses, exclusive of the one-time charges incurred during the first nine months of the year, will increase for the remainder of 2024 and beyond, as we have recently strengthened, and as we continue to further strengthen, our leadership team and other certain functions that support our clinical trials of AXPAXLI, including the SOL-1 trial and the SOL-R trial, and our business in general.

 Other Income (Expense), Net Interest Income . Interest income was 15.6 million and 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of 13.1 million year-over-year. The increase is primarily due to a higher average balance of cash and cash equivalents held by us, and higher interest rates. Interest Expense . Interest expense was 10.5 million and 7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of 3.3 million year-over-year. The increase is primarily due to higher average balances of debt outstanding as a result of us drawing 82.5 million of debt under the Barings Credit Facility in August 2023, partially offset by us paying off the MidCap Credit Facility, of 25.0 million in August 2023, and the conversion of the Convertible Notes of 37.5 million in March 2024. Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities. We recognized a non-cash loss from the change in fair values of our derivative liabilities of 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gain of 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is comprised of a loss of 2.1 million from the change in the fair value of the derivative liability related to the Barings Credit Agreement and a 1.6 million expense related to royalty fees under the Barings Credit Agreement that we paid or accrued, partially offset by a gain of 2.6 million from the change in the fair value of the derivative liability related to a conversion option embedded in the Convertible Notes. The net gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is comprised of a gain of 1.7 million from the change in the fair value of the derivative liability related to a conversion option embedded in the Convertible Notes, partially offset by a 0.4 million expense related to royalty fees under the Barings Credit Agreement that we paid or accrued. We cannot predict how the fair value of the derivative liability related to the Barings Credit Agreement will change in 2024 and beyond. Gains and Losses on Extinguishment of Debt, Net. We recognized a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt of 28.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gain, net, on extinguishment of debt of 14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 results from the conversion of the Convertible Notes in March 2024. The net gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 results from the accounting for the Convertible Notes Amendment, which resulted in a non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of 14.9 million, and for the extinguishment of our obligations under the MidCap Credit Agreement, which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 0.7 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity We have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, public offerings and private placements of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase our common stock, borrowings under credit facilities, the private placements of our convertible notes, and sales of our products. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 427.2 million, and outstanding notes payable with a principal amount of 82.5 million par value under the Barings Credit Facility. In February 2024, we sold 32,413,560 shares of our common stock at 7.52 per share and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 10,805,957 shares of our common stock at a price of 7.519 per pre-funded warrant for total net proceeds of approximately 316.4 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses, in the 2024 Private Placement. Each pre-funded warrant has an exercise price of 0.001 per share, is currently exercisable and will remain exercisable until exercised in full. On December 18, 2023, we sold 35,420,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of 3.25 per share. The total net proceeds of the public offering to us were approximately 107.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. In August 2023, we entered into a credit and security agreement, or the Barings Credit Agreement, with Barings Finance LLC, or Barings, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, providing for a secured term loan facility for us, or the Barings Credit Facility, in the aggregate principal amount of 82.5 million. We borrowed the full 

 34 

Table of Contents 
 amount of 82.5 million at closing and received proceeds of 77.3 million, after the application of an original issue discount and fees. In August 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement, or the 2021 Sales Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, under which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 100.0 million from time to time through Jefferies, acting as agent. We did not offer or sell shares of our common stock under the 2021 Sales Agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 144,718 and 1,514,926 shares of common stock, respectively, under the 2021 Sales Agreement, resulting in net proceeds to us, after accounting for issuance costs, of 0.7 million and 9.5 million, respectively. In connection with entering the Barings Credit Facility, in August 2023, we paid MidCap Financial Trust, as administrative agent, and our other lenders an aggregate of 26.2 million in satisfaction of our obligations under the MidCap Credit Facility. Funding Requirements We have a history of incurring significant operating losses. Our net losses were 36.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, 145.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 80.7 million and 71.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 842.7 million. We expect to continue to incur losses in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the clinical trials of our product candidates in development, specifically the SOL-1 trial and the SOL-R trial, and as we support the commercialization of DEXTENZA and the potential commercialization of our product candidates, subject to receiving FDA approval. We anticipate we will incur substantial expenses if and as we: continue our ongoing clinical trials, including the SOL-1 and the SOL-R trials of AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD; continue to monitor subjects in our clinical trials according to the applicable clinical trial protocols, or prepare submission documentation such as CSRs, for our clinical trials that have been completed; initiate any additional clinical trials we might determine in the future to conduct for our product candidates; continue to commercialize DEXTENZA in the United States; continue to develop and expand our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for DEXTENZA and any other products or product candidates we intend to commercialize; conduct or support research and development activities on, and seek regulatory approvals for, DEXTENZA and PAXTRAVA in specified Asian markets pursuant to our license agreement and collaboration with AffaMed Therapeutics Limited, or AffaMed; seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical development; scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support sales of commercial products, clinical trials of our product candidates and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, and expand our facilities to accommodate this scale up and any corresponding growth in personnel; maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; expand our operational, financial, administrative and management systems and personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts;

 defend ourselves against legal proceedings, if any; make investments to improve our defenses against cybersecurity threats and establish and maintain cybersecurity insurance; increase our product liability and clinical trial insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials and commercialization efforts; and continue to operate as a public company. 
 The amount and timing of these expenses determines our future capital requirements. Based on our current operating plan, which includes estimates of anticipated cash inflows from DEXTENZA product sales and cash outflows from operating expenses and capital expenditures and reflects our observance of the minimum liquidity covenant of 20.0 million under the Barings Credit Agreement, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our planned operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into 2028. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the progress, costs and outcome of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD; the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency or other regulatory authorities; the scope, progress, costs and outcome of preclinical development and any additional clinical trials we might determine in the future to conduct for our product candidates, including any additional clinical trials of AXPAXLI for NPDR, and PAXTRAVA for OAG or OHT; the level of product sales from DEXTENZA and any additional products for which we obtain marketing approval in the future and the level of third-party reimbursement of such products; the costs of sales, marketing, distribution and other commercialization efforts with respect to DEXTENZA and any additional products for which we obtain marketing approval in the future, including cost increases due to inflation; the costs of scaling up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support sales of commercial products, clinical trials of our product candidates and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval and of expanding our facilities to accommodate this scale up and any corresponding growth in personnel; the extent of our debt service obligations and our ability, if desired, to refinance any of our existing debt on terms that are more favorable to us; 
 the amounts we are entitled to receive, if any, as reimbursements for clinical trial expenditures, development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments, and royalty payments under our license agreement with AffaMed; 
 the extent to which we choose to establish additional collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements for our products and product candidates; the costs and outcomes of any legal actions and proceedings; the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products and technologies.

 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate product revenues sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements, and marketing and distribution arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds, although our license agreement with AffaMed provides for AffaMed s reimbursement of certain clinical expenses incurred by us in connection with our collaboration and for our potential receipt of development and sales milestone payments and royalty payments. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, preferred equity or convertible debt securities, our securityholders ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our existing securityholders rights as holders or beneficial owners of our common stock. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. The covenants under the Barings Credit Facility and our pledge of our assets as collateral to secure our obligations under the Barings Credit Facility pursuant to which we have a total borrowing capacity of 82.5 million, which has been fully drawn down, may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or other financing. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, products or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash used in operating activities (95,248) (47,780) Cash used in investing activities (1,086) (5,628) Cash provided by financing activities 327,597 61,658 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 231,263 8,250 Operating activities . Net cash used in operating activities was 95.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily resulting from our net loss of 145.1 million and net unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of 11.1 million, partially offset by non-cash adjustments of 61.0 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to operating expenses of 167.8 million, which we incurred primarily for research and development activities, selling and marketing activities, and general and administrative activities, and non-operating expenses of 23.9 million, partially offset by 46.6 million of revenue. Non-cash adjustments primarily include losses on extinguishment of debt of 28.0 million, stock-based compensation expense of 25.9 million, non-cash interest expense of 3.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 2.8 million, and non-cash expenses related to changes in the fair value of our derivative liabilities of 1.1 million. Net cash used by net unfavorable changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of increases of prepaid expenses and other current assets of 5.4 million, increases of accounts receivable of 4.1 million, and other increases, net, of 1.7 million. Net cash used in operating activities was 47.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily resulting from our net loss of 51.5 million and net unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of 0.9 million, partially offset by non-cash adjustments of 4.6 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to operating expenses of 106.0 million, which we incurred primarily for research and development activities, selling and marketing activities, and general and administrative activities, partially offset by 43.6 million of revenue and a net non-operating income of 10.8 million. Non-cash adjustments primarily include a net gain on extinguishment of debt of 14.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of 13.5 million, non-cash interest expense of 4.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 2.0 million, and non-cash income related to changes in the fair value of our derivative liabilities of 1.3 million. Net cash used by net unfavorable changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of increases of accounts receivables of 2.3 million and increases of other items, net, of 0.6 million, partially offset by increases of accrued expenses of 2.0 million.

 Investing activities . Net cash used in investing activities was 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of cash used to purchase property and equipment and leasehold improvements. Net cash used in investing activities was 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting of cash used to purchase property and equipment, primarily consisting of leasehold improvements. Financing activities . Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 327.6 million and consisted of total net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and pre-funded warrants in a private placement of approximately 316.4 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 10.8 million, and proceeds from issuing shares under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, of 0.5 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 61.7 million and consisted of 77.3 million from borrowing under the Barings Credit Facility, net of debt issuance costs, 9.5 million from the sale of shares of our common stock under the 2021 Sales Agreement, and 1.0 million from the exercises of stock options and purchases of shares of our common stock under the ESPP, partially offset by repayment of the MidCap Credit Facility of 26.1 million. In March 2023, we requested a protective advance of 2.0 million under our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement with MidCap Financial Trust, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, in response to the closure of Silicon Valley Bank, which was deemed a credit extension. We repaid the full principal amount of 2.0 million in March 2023. Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

Less Than 1 to 3 3 to 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (in thousands) Operating lease commitments 8,871 2,665 5,182 1,024 Barings Credit Agreement 82,474 82,474 Total 91,345 2,665 5,182 1,024 82,474 The table above includes our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments at September 30, 2024, as well as obligations related to contracts that we are likely to continue, regardless of the fact that they may be cancelable at September 30, 2024. Some of the figures that we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the amounts we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table. We enter into contracts in the normal course of business to assist in the performance of our research and development activities, including agreements with clinical research organizations regarding the SOL-1 trial and the SOL-R trial, and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice and therefore are cancelable contracts which are not included in contractual obligations and commitments. Operating lease commitments represent payments due under our leases of office, laboratory and manufacturing space in Bedford, Massachusetts that expire in July 2027 and July 2028, and leases of equipment that expire in 2028. The commitments under the Barings Credit Agreement represent repayment of principal only. Future payments of interest under the Barings Credit Agreement depend on the level of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, and future payments of royalty fees depend on our future revenue from DEXTENZA, both of which cannot be estimated at this time. We have in-licensed a significant portion of our intellectual property from Incept, an intellectual property holding company, under an amended and restated license agreement, or the Incept License Agreement, that we entered into with Incept in January 2012, which was most recently amended in September 2018. We are obligated to pay Incept a royalty equal to a low-single-digit percentage of net sales made by us or our affiliates of any products , devices, materials, or components thereof, or the Licensed Products, including or covered by Original IP (as defined in the Incept License Agreement), excluding the Shape-Changing IP (as defined in the Incept License Agreement), in the Ophthalmic Field of Use (as defined in the Incept License Agreement). We are obligated to pay Incept a royalty equal to a mid-single-digit percentage of net sales made by us or our affiliates of any Licensed Products including or covered by Original IP, excluding the Shape-Changing IP, in the Additional Field of Use (as defined in the Incept License Agreement). We are

Table of Contents 
 obligated to pay Incept a royalty equal to a low-single-digit percentage of net sales made by us or our affiliates of any Licensed Products including or covered by Incept IP (as defined in the Incept License Agreement) or Joint IP (as defined in the Incept License Agreement) in the field of drug delivery. Any sublicensee of ours also will be obligated to pay Incept a royalty on net sales of Licensed Products made by it and will be bound by the terms of the agreement to the same extent as we are. We are obligated to reimburse Incept for our share of the reasonable fees and costs incurred by Incept in connection with the prosecution of the patent applications licensed to us under the agreement. Our share of these fees and costs is equal to the total amount of such fees and costs divided by the total number of Incept s exclusive licensees of the patent application. We have not included in the table above any payments to Incept under this license agreement as the amount, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating financing transactions that are not required to be reflected on our balance sheets. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and have had or are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those policies. Our critical accounting policies, which relate to revenue recognition and our derivative liabilities, are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024. The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued research and development expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the current period s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 427.2 million, which includes cash in operating bank accounts, and investments in money market funds. We have policies requiring us to invest in high-quality issuers, limit our exposure to any individual issuer, and ensure adequate liquidity. Our primary exposure to market risk related to our cash and cash equivalents is interest-rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our investments are in short-term securities. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 

 39 

Table of Contents 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a secured term loan facility with a principal amount of 82.5 million under a credit and security agreement with Barings Finance LLC and the lenders party thereto, or the Barings Credit Agreement. Expected cash outflows from this financial instrument fluctuate based on changes in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, which is, among other factors, affected by the general level of U.S. and international central bank interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, an immediate 100 basis point increase or decrease in the SOFR would not have a material effect on the anticipated cash outflows from this instrument. We account for the obligation to pay royalty fees embedded in the Barings Credit Agreement as a separate financial instrument, measured at fair value, using a Monte Carlo simulation, which we refer to as the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability. As of September 30, 2024, the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability was valued at 14.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, a 10 increase or decrease of the interest rate used in the valuation model would not have a material effect on the fair value of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability. Changes of the fair value of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability have no impact on anticipated cash outflows related to this liability. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are not presently a party to any material legal proceedings, nor to the knowledge of management are any material legal proceedings threatened against us. Item 1A. Risk Factors. We are subject to a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and future growth prospects, including those identified under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on March 11, 2024, which we refer to as our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects, and such risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities The following table sets forth information with respect to repurchases of shares of our common stock during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024: Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share (1) Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (In thousands) (In thousands) (In thousands) July 1 to July 31, 2024 August 1 to August 31, 2024 31,551 8.35 September 1 to September 30, 2024 (1) On August 7, 2024, we purchased a total of 31,551 shares of our common stock in open-market transactions in connection with the unwinding of our previously reported inadvertent issuance of 31,551 shares to a former employee upon the vesting and settlement of a restricted stock unit award. The shares were purchased at an average price per share of 8.35. Item 5. Other Information. Director and Officer Trading Arrangements A portion of the compensation of our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) is in the form of equity awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, and, from time to time, directors and officers engage in open-market transactions with respect to the securities acquired pursuant to such equity awards or other of our securities, including to satisfy tax withholding obligations when equity awards vest or are exercised, and for diversification or other personal reasons.

Table of Contents 
 Transactions in our securities by directors and officers are required to be made in accordance with our insider trading policy, which requires that the transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables directors and officers to prearrange transactions in our securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions while in possession of material nonpublic information. of our directors and officers or a trading for the sale or purchase of our securities that is either (1) a contract, instruction or written plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c), or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement , or (2) a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K) during the quarterly period covered by this report. In Item 5 of Part II of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, we inadvertently omitted the disclosure of a new Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement entered into by one of our officers. The terms of this 10b5-1 trading arrangement are described below: ) ) Durable Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement for sell-to-cover transactions relating to all equity awards that have or may be granted Sale Until final settlement of any covered RSUs Indeterminable (1) (1) The number of shares subject to covered RSUs that will be sold to satisfy applicable tax withholding obligations upon vesting is unknown as the number will vary based on the extent to which vesting conditions are satisfied, the market price of the Company s common stock at the time of settlement and the potential future grant of additional RSUs subject to this arrangement. This trading arrangement, which applies to RSUs whether vesting is based on the passage of time and/or the achievement of performance goals, provides for the automatic sale of shares that would otherwise be issuable on each settlement date of a covered RSU in an amount sufficient to satisfy the applicable withholding obligation, with the proceeds of the sale delivered to the Company in satisfaction of the applicable withholding obligation.

 - 8 - 

 defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) for Executive. For purposes of this Section 4(e), the Contingent Compensation Payments so eliminated shall be referred to as the Eliminated Payments and the aggregate amount (determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, Q/A-30 or any successor provision) of the Contingent Compensation Payments so eliminated shall be referred to as the Eliminated Amount. (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4(e)(i), no such reduction in Contingent Compensation Payments shall be made if (1) the Eliminated Amount (computed without regard to this sentence) exceeds (2) 100 of the aggregate present value (determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, Q/A-31 and Q/A-32 or any successor provisions) of the amount of any additional taxes that would be incurred by Executive if the Eliminated Payments (determined without regard to this sentence) were paid to Executive (including federal and state income taxes on the Eliminated Payments, the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code payable with respect to all of the Contingent Compensation Payments in excess of Executive s base amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code), and any withholding taxes). The override of such reduction in Contingent Compensation Payments pursuant to this Section 4(e)(ii) shall be referred to as a Section 4(e)(ii) Override. For purpose of this paragraph, if any federal or state income taxes would be attributable to the receipt of any Eliminated Payment, the amount of such taxes shall be computed by multiplying the amount of the Eliminated Payment by the maximum combined federal and state income tax rate provided by law. (iii) For purposes of this Section 4(e) the following terms shall have the following respective meanings: (A) Change in Ownership or Control shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company determined in accordance with Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. (B) Contingent Compensation Payment shall mean any payment (or benefit) in the nature of compensation that is made or made available (under this Agreement or otherwise) to a disqualified individual (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) and that is contingent (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) on a Change in Ownership or Control of the Company. (iv) Any payments or other benefits otherwise due to Executive following a Change in Ownership or Control that could reasonably be characterized (as determined by the Company) as Contingent Compensation Payments (the Potential Payments shall not be made until the dates provided for in this Section 4(e)(iv). Within 30 days after each date on which Executive first becomes entitled to receive (whether or not then due) a Contingent Compensation Payment relating to such Change in Ownership or Control, the Company shall determine and notify Executive (with reasonable detail regarding the basis for its determinations) (1) which Potential Payments constitute Contingent Compensation Payments, (2) the Eliminated Amount and (3) whether the Section 4(e)(ii) Override is applicable. Within 30 days after delivery of such notice to Executive, Executive shall deliver a response to the Company (the Executive Response 
 - 9 - 

 stating either (A) that Executive agrees with the Company s determination pursuant to the preceding sentence or (B) that Executive disagrees with such determination, in which case Executive shall set forth (x) which Potential Payments should be characterized as Contingent Compensation Payments, (y) the Eliminated Amount, and (z) whether the Section 4(e)(ii) Override is applicable. In the event that Executive fails to deliver an Executive Response on or before the required date, the Company s initial determination shall be final. If Executive states in the Executive Response that Executive agrees with the Company s determination, the Company shall make the Potential Payments to Executive within three business days following delivery to the Company of the Executive Response (except for any Potential Payments which are not due to be made until after such date, which Potential Payments shall be made on the date on which they are due). If Executive states in the Executive Response that Executive disagrees with the Company s determination, then, for a period of 60 days following delivery of the Executive Response, Executive and the Company shall use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within such 60-day period, such dispute shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator s award in any court having jurisdiction. The Company shall, within three business days following delivery to the Company of the Executive Response, make to Executive those Potential Payments as to which there is no dispute between the Company and Executive regarding whether they should be made (except for any such Potential Payments which are not due to be made until after such date, which Potential Payments shall be made on the date on which they are due). The balance of the Potential Payments shall be made within three business days following the resolution of such dispute. (v) The Contingent Compensation Payments to be treated as Eliminated Payments shall be determined by the Company by determining the Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio (as defined below) for each Contingent Compensation Payment and then reducing the Contingent Compensation Payments in order beginning with the Contingent Compensation Payment with the highest Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio. For Contingent Compensation Payments with the same Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio, such Contingent Compensation Payment shall be reduced based on the time of payment of such Contingent Compensation Payments with amounts having later payment dates being reduced first. For Contingent Compensation Payments with the same Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio and the same time of payment, such Contingent Compensation Payments shall be reduced on a pro rata basis (but not below zero) prior to reducing Contingent Compensation Payments with a lower Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio. The term Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio shall mean a fraction the numerator of which is the value of the applicable Contingent Compensation Payment that must be taken into account by Executive for purposes of Section 4999(a) of the Code, and the denominator of which is the actual amount to be received by Executive in respect of the applicable Contingent Compensation Payment. For example, in the case of an equity grant that is treated as contingent on the Change in Ownership or Control because the time at which the payment is made or the payment vests is accelerated, the denominator shall be determined by reference to the fair market value of the equity at the acceleration date, and not in accordance with the methodology for determining the value of accelerated payments set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1Q/A-24(b) or (c)). 
 - 10 - 

 (vi) The provisions of this Section 4(e) are intended to apply to any and all payments or benefits available to Executive under this Agreement or any other agreement or plan of the Company under which Executive receives Contingent Compensation Payments. 5.

Executive further acknowledges that the Executive s receipt of the equity awards as set forth in Section 3(c) above and Executive s eligibility for the severance benefits described in Section 4(b) above is contingent on Executive s agreement to the post-employment non- competition provisions set forth in the Restrictive Covenants Agreement. Executive further acknowledges that such consideration was mutually agreed upon by Executive and the Company and is fair and reasonable in exchange for Executive s compliance with such non-competition obligations and that Executive was provided at least ten (10) business days to review the Restrictive Covenants Agreement. 6. Records . Upon termination of Executive s relationship with the Company, Executive shall deliver to the Company any property of the Company which may be in Executive s possession including products, materials, memoranda, notes, records, reports, or other documents or photocopies of the same. 7.

The override of such reduction in Contingent Compensation Payments pursuant to this Section 4(e)(ii) shall be referred to as a Section 4(e)(ii) Override. For purpose of this paragraph, if any federal or state income taxes would be attributable to the receipt of any Eliminated Payment, the amount of such taxes shall be computed by multiplying the amount of the Eliminated Payment by the maximum combined federal and state income tax rate provided by law. (iii) For purposes of this Section 4(e) the following terms shall have the following respective meanings: (A) Change in Ownership or Control shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company determined in accordance with Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. (B) Contingent Compensation Payment shall mean any payment (or benefit) in the nature of compensation that is made or made available (under this Agreement or otherwise) to a disqualified individual (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) and that is contingent (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) on a Change in Ownership or Control of the Company. (iv) Any payments or other benefits otherwise due to Executive following a Change in Ownership or Control that could reasonably be characterized (as determined by the Company) as Contingent Compensation Payments (the Potential Payments shall not be made until the dates provided for in this Section 4(e)(iv). Within 30 days after each date on which Executive first becomes entitled to receive (whether or not then due) a Contingent Compensation Payment relating to such Change in Ownership or Control, the Company shall determine and notify Executive (with reasonable detail regarding the basis for its determinations) (1) which Potential Payments constitute Contingent Compensation Payments, (2) the Eliminated Amount and (3) whether the Section 4(e)(ii) Override is applicable. Within 30 days after delivery of such notice to Executive, Executive shall deliver a response to the Company (the Executive Response 
 - 9 - 

 stating either (A) that Executive agrees with the Company s determination pursuant to the preceding sentence or (B) that Executive disagrees with such determination, in which case Executive shall set forth (x) which Potential Payments should be characterized as Contingent Compensation Payments, (y) the Eliminated Amount, and (z) whether the Section 4(e)(ii) Override is applicable. In the event that Executive fails to deliver an Executive Response on or before the required date, the Company s initial determination shall be final. If Executive states in the Executive Response that Executive agrees with the Company s determination, the Company shall make the Potential Payments to Executive within three business days following delivery to the Company of the Executive Response (except for any Potential Payments which are not due to be made until after such date, which Potential Payments shall be made on the date on which they are due). If Executive states in the Executive Response that Executive disagrees with the Company s determination, then, for a period of 60 days following delivery of the Executive Response, Executive and the Company shall use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within such 60-day period, such dispute shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator s award in any court having jurisdiction. The Company shall, within three business days following delivery to the Company of the Executive Response, make to Executive those Potential Payments as to which there is no dispute between the Company and Executive regarding whether they should be made (except for any such Potential Payments which are not due to be made until after such date, which Potential Payments shall be made on the date on which they are due). The balance of the Potential Payments shall be made within three business days following the resolution of such dispute. (v) The Contingent Compensation Payments to be treated as Eliminated Payments shall be determined by the Company by determining the Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio (as defined below) for each Contingent Compensation Payment and then reducing the Contingent Compensation Payments in order beginning with the Contingent Compensation Payment with the highest Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio. For Contingent Compensation Payments with the same Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio, such Contingent Compensation Payment shall be reduced based on the time of payment of such Contingent Compensation Payments with amounts having later payment dates being reduced first. For Contingent Compensation Payments with the same Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio and the same time of payment, such Contingent Compensation Payments shall be reduced on a pro rata basis (but not below zero) prior to reducing Contingent Compensation Payments with a lower Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio. The term Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio shall mean a fraction the numerator of which is the value of the applicable Contingent Compensation Payment that must be taken into account by Executive for purposes of Section 4999(a) of the Code, and the denominator of which is the actual amount to be received by Executive in respect of the applicable Contingent Compensation Payment. For example, in the case of an equity grant that is treated as contingent on the Change in Ownership or Control because the time at which the payment is made or the payment vests is accelerated, the denominator shall be determined by reference to the fair market value of the equity at the acceleration date, and not in accordance with the methodology for determining the value of accelerated payments set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1Q/A-24(b) or (c)). 
 - 10 - 

 (vi) The provisions of this Section 4(e) are intended to apply to any and all payments or benefits available to Executive under this Agreement or any other agreement or plan of the Company under which Executive receives Contingent Compensation Payments. 5.

Executive further acknowledges that such consideration was mutually agreed upon by Executive and the Company and is fair and reasonable in exchange for Executive s compliance with such non-competition obligations and that Executive was provided at least ten (10) business days to review the Restrictive Covenants Agreement. 6.

(d) Compliance with Section 409A . Subject to the provisions in this Section 4(d), any severance payments or benefits under this Agreement shall begin only upon the date of Executive s separation from service (determined as set forth below) which occurs on or after the date of termination of Executive s employment. The following rules shall apply with respect to the distribution of the severance payments and benefits, if any, to be provided to Executive under this Agreement: (i) It is intended that each installment of the severance payments and benefits provided under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A. Neither the Company nor Executive shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any such payments or benefits except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A. (ii) If, as of the date of Executive s separation from service from the Company, Executive is not a specified employee (within the meaning of Section 409A), then each installment of the severance payments and benefits shall be made on the dates and terms set forth in this Agreement. (iii)If, as of the date of Executive s separation from service from the Company, Executive is a specified employee (within the meaning of Section 409A), then: (A) Each installment of the severance payments and benefits due under this Agreement that, in accordance with the dates and terms set forth herein, will in all circumstances, regardless of when the separation from service occurs, be paid within the short-term deferral period (as defined under Section 409A) shall be treated as a short-term deferral within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A and such payments and benefits shall be paid or provided on the dates and terms set forth in this Agreement; and (B) Each installment of the severance payments and benefits due under this Agreement that is not described in Section 4(d)(iii)(A) above and that would, absent this subsection (B), be paid within the six-month period following Executive s separation from service from the Company shall not be paid until the date that is six months and one day after such separation from service (or, if earlier, Executive s death), with any such installments that are required to be delayed being accumulated during the six-month period and paid in a lump sum on the date that is six months and one day following Executive s separation from service and any subsequent installments, if any, being paid in accordance with the dates and terms set forth herein; provided, however, that the preceding provisions of this sentence shall not apply to any installment of severance payments and benefits if and to the maximum extent that such installment is deemed to be paid under a separation pay plan that does not provide for a deferral of compensation by reason of the application of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) (relating to separation pay upon an involuntary separation from service). Any installments that qualify for the exception under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A- 
 - 10 - 

1(b)(9)(iii) must be paid no later than the last day of Executive s second taxable year following the taxable year in which the separation from service occurs. (iv) The determination of whether and when Executive s separation from service from the Company has occurred shall be made in a manner consistent with, and based on the presumptions set forth in, Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h). Solely for purposes of this Section 4(d)(iv), Company shall include all persons with whom the Company would be considered a single employer under Sections 414(b) and 414(c) of the Code. (v) All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A to the extent that such reimbursements or in-kind benefits are subject to Section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirements that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during Executive s lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred and (iv) the right to reimbursement is not subject to set off or liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. (vi) The parties intend that the payments and benefits under this Agreement shall be exempt from or shall comply with Section 409A and this Agreement shall be interpreted consistent with such intent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall have no liability to Executive or to any other person if the payments and benefits provided hereunder that are intended to be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A are not so exempt or compliant. (e) Modified Section 280G Cutback . (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except as set forth in Section 4(e)(ii), in the event that the Company undergoes a Change in Ownership or Control (as defined below), the Company shall not be obligated to provide to Executive a portion of any Contingent Compensation Payments (as defined below) that Executive would otherwise be entitled to receive to the extent necessary to eliminate any excess parachute payments (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) for Executive. For purposes of this Section 4(e), the Contingent Compensation Payments so eliminated shall be referred to as the Eliminated Payments and the aggregate amount (determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, Q/A-30 or any successor provision) of the Contingent Compensation Payments so eliminated shall be referred to as the Eliminated Amount. (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4(e)(i), no such reduction in Contingent Compensation Payments shall be made if (1) the Eliminated Amount (computed without regard to this sentence) exceeds (2) 100 of the aggregate present 
 - 11 - 

value (determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, Q/A-31 and Q/A-32 or any successor provisions) of the amount of any additional taxes that would be incurred by Executive if the Eliminated Payments (determined without regard to this sentence) were paid to Executive (including federal and state income taxes on the Eliminated Payments, the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code payable with respect to all of the Contingent Compensation Payments in excess of Executive s base amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code), and any withholding taxes). The override of such reduction in Contingent Compensation Payments pursuant to this Section 4(e)(ii) shall be referred to as a Section 4(e)(ii) Override. For purpose of this paragraph, if any federal or state income taxes would be attributable to the receipt of any Eliminated Payment, the amount of such taxes shall be computed by multiplying the amount of the Eliminated Payment by the maximum combined federal and state income tax rate provided by law. (iii) For purposes of this Section 4(e) the following terms shall have the following respective meanings: (A) Change in Ownership or Control shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company determined in accordance with Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. (B) Contingent Compensation Payment shall mean any payment (or benefit) in the nature of compensation that is made or made available (under this Agreement or otherwise) to a disqualified individual (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) and that is contingent (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) on a Change in Ownership or Control of the Company. (iv) Any payments or other benefits otherwise due to Executive following a Change in Ownership or Control that could reasonably be characterized (as determined by the Company) as Contingent Compensation Payments (the Potential Payments shall not be made until the dates provided for in this Section 4(e)(iv). Within 30 days after each date on which Executive first becomes entitled to receive (whether or not then due) a Contingent Compensation Payment relating to such Change in Ownership or Control, the Company shall determine and notify Executive (with reasonable detail regarding the basis for its determinations) (1) which Potential Payments constitute Contingent Compensation Payments, (2) the Eliminated Amount and (3) whether the Section 4(e)(ii) Override is applicable. Within 30 days after delivery of such notice to Executive, Executive shall deliver a response to the Company (the Executive Response stating either (A) that Executive agrees with the Company s determination pursuant to the preceding sentence or (B) that Executive disagrees with such determination, in which case Executive shall set forth (x) which Potential Payments should be characterized as Contingent Compensation Payments, (y) the Eliminated Amount, and (z) whether the Section 4(e)(ii) Override is applicable. In the event that Executive fails to deliver an Executive Response on or before the required date, the Company s initial determination shall be final. If Executive states in the Executive Response that Executive agrees with the Company s determination, the 
 - 12 - 

Company shall make the Potential Payments to Executive within three business days following delivery to the Company of the Executive Response (except for any Potential Payments which are not due to be made until after such date, which Potential Payments shall be made on the date on which they are due). If Executive states in the Executive Response that Executive disagrees with the Company s determination, then, for a period of 60 days following delivery of the Executive Response, Executive and the Company shall use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within such 60-day period, such dispute shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator s award in any court having jurisdiction. The Company shall, within three business days following delivery to the Company of the Executive Response, make to Executive those Potential Payments as to which there is no dispute between the Company and Executive regarding whether they should be made (except for any such Potential Payments which are not due to be made until after such date, which Potential Payments shall be made on the date on which they are due). The balance of the Potential Payments shall be made within three business days following the resolution of such dispute. (v) The Contingent Compensation Payments to be treated as Eliminated Payments shall be determined by the Company by determining the Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio (as defined below) for each Contingent Compensation Payment and then reducing the Contingent Compensation Payments in order beginning with the Contingent Compensation Payment with the highest Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio. For Contingent Compensation Payments with the same Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio, such Contingent Compensation Payment shall be reduced based on the time of payment of such Contingent Compensation Payments with amounts having later payment dates being reduced first. For Contingent Compensation Payments with the same Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio and the same time of payment, such Contingent Compensation Payments shall be reduced on a pro rata basis (but not below zero) prior to reducing Contingent Compensation Payments with a lower Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio. The term Contingent Compensation Payment Ratio shall mean a fraction the numerator of which is the value of the applicable Contingent Compensation Payment that must be taken into account by Executive for purposes of Section 4999(a) of the Code, and the denominator of which is the actual amount to be received by Executive in respect of the applicable Contingent Compensation Payment. For example, in the case of an equity grant that is treated as contingent on the Change in Ownership or Control because the time at which the payment is made or the payment vests is accelerated, the denominator shall be determined by reference to the fair market value of the equity at the acceleration date, and not in accordance with the methodology for determining the value of accelerated payments set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1Q/A-24(b) or (c)). (vi) The provisions of this Section 4(e) are intended to apply to any and all payments or benefits available to Executive under this Agreement or any other agreement or plan of the Company under which Executive receives Contingent Compensation Payments.

Executive further acknowledges that the Executive s receipt of the equity award as set forth in Section 3(c) above and eligibility for the severance benefits set forth in Section 4(b) above is contingent on Executive s agreement to the post-employment non-competition provisions set forth in the Restrictive Covenants Agreement. Executive further acknowledges that such consideration was mutually agreed upon by Executive and the Company and is fair and reasonable in exchange for Executive s compliance with such non-competition obligations.
