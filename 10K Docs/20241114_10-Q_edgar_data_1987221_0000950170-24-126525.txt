Subsidiary I filed an election with the Internal Revenue Service to be treated as a corporation for tax purposes and is subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. The consolidated financial statements include Subsidiary I, for which a provision for corporate income taxes has been recorded. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Subsidiary I recorded as a deferred tax expense and deferred tax liability. Deferred income tax is computed by applying the federal statutory income tax rate of and estimated applicable state tax statutory rates (net of federal tax benefit) to unrealized gains/(losses) on investments before taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

There were no significant changes in valuation approach or technique as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privately held entities where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs. The income and market approaches were used in the determination of fair value of certain Level 3 assets. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the discount rate or market yield used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments and any other end of term fees, as applicable. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates are factors such as risk of default, interest rate risk, and changes in credit quality. The significant unobservable inputs used in the market approach are based on market comparable transactions and market multiples of publicly traded comparable companies. For discussion of the fair value measurement of the Fund's borrowings, refer to Note 6 Borrowings. 

 of net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable quarter. The Management Fee will be appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable quarter. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund incurred and , respectively, in Management Fees under the Investment Management Agreement. The Investment Adviser has chosen to voluntarily waive and , respectively, of Management Fees earned in accordance with the Investment Management Agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a part of Fee Waivers. Any fees waived under the Investment Management Agreement are not subject to future reimbursement to the Investment Adviser pursuant to the Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement. Incentive Fee The Incentive Fee consists of two components that are independent of each other. A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on a percentage of the Fund s income and a portion is based on a percentage of the Fund s capital gains, each as described below:

per quarter annualized); 

 of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of annualized). This portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than is referred to as the catch-up. The catch-up is meant to provide the Investment Adviser with approximately of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 

 of the amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are paid to the Investment Adviser. 

 These calculations are pro-rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any Share issuances or repurchases during the applicable quarter. The second part of the Incentive Fee, the capital gains incentive fee, will be payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year and will equal of the Fund s cumulative realized capital gains, if any, from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees on fees on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP. Each year, the fee paid for the capital gains incentive fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for all prior periods. The Fund will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Investment Adviser if the Fund were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. For purposes of computing the Fund s Incentive Fee on capital gains, the calculation methodology looks through derivative financial instruments or swaps, if owned, as if the Fund owned the reference assets directly. The fees that are payable under the Investment Management Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund incurred and , respectively, in Incentive Fees under the Investment Management Agreement. The Investment Adviser has chosen to voluntarily waive and , respectively, of incentive fees earned in accordance with the Investment Management Agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a part of Fee Waivers. Any fees waived under the Investment Management Agreement are not subject to future reimbursement to the Investment Adviser pursuant to the Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement. Administration Agreement The Fund entered into an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement with AMG Funds LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of AMG (the Administrator ), under which the Administrator will perform or oversees the performance of certain administrative services for the Fund. The Fund will pay the Administrator a fee (the Administration Fee at the rate of per annum of the Fund s net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable quarter, adjusted

The Administrator has chosen to voluntarily waive and , respectively, of administration fees earned in accordance with the Administration Agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a part of Fee Waivers. Any fees waived under the Administration Agreement are not subject to future reimbursement to the Administrator pursuant to the Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement. Amended and Restated Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement Effective December 26, 2023, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator entered into an Amended and Restated Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement with the Fund for a two year term beginning on the effective date of the Investment Management Agreement and ending on October 23, 2005 thereof (the Limitation Period to pay, absorb, or reimburse the Fund s aggregate Operating Expenses (as defined below) on the Fund s behalf (x) above of the value of the Fund s quarterly net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable quarter adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable quarter for the period of time that the Fund operates as a privately offered, non-traded BDC and (y) above of the value of the Fund s monthly net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases for the applicable month during the period of time that the Fund operates as a publicly- offered, non- traded BDC (each such payment, absorption or reimbursement, a Required Expense Payment ). Operating Expenses mean all of the Fund s operating costs and expenses incurred, including but not limited to, organization and offering costs and legal, administration, accounting, printing, mailing, subscription processing and filings fees and expenses, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Operating Expenses shall not include any fees payable to the Investment Adviser by the Fund under the Investment Management Agreement, interest expenses and other financing costs, portfolio transaction and other investment-related costs, shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees, taxes, and any other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Fund s business (including, without limitation, litigation expenses). The Investment Adviser and the Administrator may elect to pay certain additional expenses of the Fund on the Fund s behalf (each such payment, a Voluntary Expense Payment and together with a Required Expense Payment, the Expense Payments ). In making a Voluntary Expense Payment, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator will designate, as they deem necessary or advisable, what type of expense is being paid (including, whether it is an Operating Expense); provided that no portion of a Voluntary Expense Payment will be used to pay any interest expense or distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees of the Fund. The Fund agrees to carry forward the amount of any Expense Payment for a period not to exceed three years from the end of the month in which such Expense Payment was paid or reimbursed by the Investment Adviser and the Administrator, and to reimburse the Investment Adviser and the Administrator on a 50/50 basis in the amount of such Expense Payment as promptly as possible, on a monthly basis, even if such reimbursement occurs after the termination of the Limitation Period (each such payment, a Reimbursement Payment ), provided that the Fund s operating expense ratio Operating Expense Ratio (expressed as a percentage of the Fund s net assets and including the amount of the reimbursed payment) at the time of the reimbursement payment is less than the Fund s expense ratio (expressed as a percentage of the Fund s net assets) at the time the Required Expense Payment was made. In respect of a Voluntary Expense Payment, no Reimbursement Payment for any quarter shall be made if and to the extent that: (1) the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share (expressed as the annualized rate of regular cash distributions per share exclusive of returns of capital and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any) declared by the Fund at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is less than the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share at the time the Voluntary Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates or (2) the Fund s Operating Expense Ratio at the time of such Reimbursement Payment (including the amount of the Reimbursement Payment) is greater than the Operating Expense Ratio at the time of the Voluntary Payment was made. The contractual expense limitation may be terminated by the Fund s Board upon thirty days written notice to the Investment Adviser and the Administrator. The Amended and Restated Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement may be renewed by the mutual agreement of the Investment Adviser, the Administrator and the Fund for successive terms of one year. Unless so renewed, the Amended and Restated Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement will terminate automatically at the end of the Limitation Period. The Amended and Restated Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement will also terminate automatically upon the termination of the Investment Management Agreement, unless a new investment advisory agreement with the Investment Adviser (or with an affiliate under common control with the Investment Adviser) becomes effective upon such termination.

Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation. Our primary focus is to provide risk-adjusted returns and current income to investors by investing primarily in middle-market companies with EBITDA generally between 10 million and 100 million within a wide range of industries, although the Fund intends to focus on industries in which the Investment Adviser and its affiliates have investing experience and access to operating resources, including but not limited to healthcare, financial services, business technology services, industrials, consumer products, and franchisors/retail.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made 108,813 of investments in new or existing portfolio companies and had 1,000 in aggregate amount of sales and repayments, resulting in net investments of 107,813 for the period. The total portfolio of debt investments at fair value consisted of 100 bearing variable interest rates and 0 bearing fixed interest rates.

Portfolio Asset Quality 
 Our Investment Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Investment Adviser grades the credit risk of all debt investments on a scale of 1 to 6 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio debt investment relative to the inherent risk at the time the original debt investment was made (i.e., at the time of acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. 

Loan Rating 
 
 Summary Description 

1 
 
 Investments that are performing at or above expectations. No issues or foreseen issues on performance, covenants, liquidity, etc. The credit is expected to be repaid at or prior to maturity through available cash flow or to be refinanced. 

2 
 
 Investments that are performing substantially within our expectations, with the risks remaining neutral or favorable. All new loans are initially rated 2. The credit is expected to be repaid at or prior to maturity through available cash flow or to be refinanced by a third party. 

3 
 
 Investments that are performing below our expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where we expect no loss of investment return or principal. 

4 
 
 Investments that are performing below our expectations and for which risk has increased since the original investment. Although the loan is underperforming, there is not a high likelihood of any loss of principal or interest but there may be a possibility for equity returns, one-time fees or capitalized interest (if applicable) to be implied. 

5 
 
 Investments that are performing substantially below our expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. Typically, the borrower will be in default, or the loan will have been modified to address a default or the loan may be past due. 

6 
 
 Investments that are performing poorly; it is unlikely that the enterprise or asset values currently exceed the debt and/or material reduction in enterprise value is reasonably foreseen. 

29 

The Investment Adviser focuses on downside protection by leveraging existing rights available under the credit documents; however, for investments that are significantly underperforming, which may need to be restructured, the Investment Adviser s workout team partners with the investment team and all material amendments, waivers and restructurings require the approval of a majority of the Investment Committee. 
 
 The weighted average risk rating of our investments based on fair value was 2.0 as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Fund had no portfolio companies on non-accrual status.

 As of September 30, 2024, we are party to the Secured Loan Facility, as described in more detail in Note 6 Borrowings. 
 Our primary use of cash is to originate (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (2) the cost of operations (including expenses, the Management Fee and, to the extent permitted under 
 31 

ERISA, if applicable, and the 1940 Act, any indemnification obligations), (3) debt service of any borrowings and (4) cash distributions to our shareholders. 
 Operating liquidity is our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. The following table presents our operating liquidity position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

Taxation as a RIC 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our shareholders. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each tax year, an amount equal to at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gain over realized net long-term capital loss and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a RIC, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on our income and capital gains. 
 Additionally, in order to avoid the imposition of a U.S. federal excise tax, we are required to distribute, in respect of each calendar year, dividends to our shareholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of 98 of our calendar year net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections); 98.2 of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year; and any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding calendar years that were not distributed during such calendar years and on which we previously did not incur any U.S. federal income tax. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any reason and become subject to corporate tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. 
 Related Party Transactions and Agreements 
 Investment Management Agreement 
 We entered into an Investment Management Agreement, dated as of October 20, 2023, which was approved by our Board for an initial two year term, under which the Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of our Board manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to us. Affiliates of the Investment Adviser also provide investment advisory services to other funds that have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. The Investment Adviser has adopted policies designed to manage and mitigate the conflicts of interest associated with the allocation of investment opportunities among multiple funds. In addition, any affiliated fund currently formed or formed in the future and managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. However, in certain instances due to regulatory, tax, investment, or other restrictions, certain investment opportunities may not be appropriate for either us or other funds managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates. 
 Administration Agreement 
 On October 20, 2023, we entered into an Administration Agreement with AMG Funds LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMG (the Administrator ). Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides, or oversees the performance of, administrative and compliance services necessary for the operation of the Fund, including, but not limited to, maintaining financial records, overseeing the calculation of NAV, compliance monitoring (including diligence and oversight of the Fund s other service providers), preparing reports to shareholders and reports filed with the SEC and other regulators, preparing materials and coordinating meetings of the Fund s Board, managing the payment of expenses, the payment and receipt of funds for investments and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others and providing office space, equipment and office services. The Administrator may also provide on our behalf managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. 
 The Administrator has retained the Sub-Administrator to perform some of its obligations under the Administration Agreement. The Sub-Administrator receives compensation for its sub-administrative services under the Sub-Administration Agreement. In addition, we have entered into the Fund Accounting Servicing Agreement, pursuant to which the Sub-Administrator provides us with accounting 
 32 

services. We will reimburse the Sub-Administrator for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Sub-Administrator in providing these services under the Fund Accounting Servicing Agreement. 
 Distributions and Dividends 
 Distributions declared for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 2,001 and 3,623, respectively. 
 The following table reflects cash distributions, including dividends and returns of capital, if any, per share that have been declared by our Board as of September 30, 2024 and as of our most recent fiscal period ended December 31, 2023:

We intend to pay quarterly distributions to our shareholders in amounts sufficient to qualify as and maintain our status as a RIC. We intend to distribute approximately all of our net investment income no less frequently than quarterly and substantially all of our taxable income on an annual basis, except that we may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment. 
 Borrowings 
 We are only allowed to borrow money such that our asset coverage, which, as defined in the 1940 Act, measures the ratio of total assets less total liabilities not represented by senior securities to total borrowings, equals at least 150 after such borrowing, with certain limited exceptions. As a result, in addition to the foregoing 1940 Act restriction on leverage, we do not currently expect to borrow in excess of the lesser of 20 of our Aggregate Committed Capital and 300 million. We may in the future, though, determine to utilize a greater amount of leverage, including for investment purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we had 67,897 par value of outstanding borrowings and our asset coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings was 248 , compliant with the minimum asset coverage level of 150 generally required by a BDC by the 1940 Act. 
 Secured Loan Facility 
 On July 16, 2024, Subsidiary II entered into a Loan and Servicing Agreement (the Secured Loan Facility ), with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as administrative agent and the collateral agent and Western Alliance Trust Company, N.A., as account bank, collateral custodian and collateral administrator. The Secured Loan Facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars up to a maximum principal amount of 300 million. Proceeds from the borrowings under the Secured Loan Facility will be used primarily to finance the purchase or origination of loans. Unless otherwise terminated, the Secured Loan Facility will mature on July 16, 2029. The interest rate on outstanding loans will be calculated by taking the highest of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 , the 1-month SOFR rate plus 1.0 or zero, plus a spread of 2.60 . 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have entered into an Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser pursuant to the 1940 Act to provide us with investment advisory services and the Administration Agreement with the Administrator to provide us with administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the Advisory Agreement are described under Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Related Party Transactions . Payments for administration services under the Administration Agreement are described under Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Related Party Transactions . 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 
 Commitments 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may enter into future funding commitments. As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments on revolving credit lines and delayed draw term loans of 21,975. We maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy 
 33 

unfunded commitments, including cash on hand and undrawn Capital Commitments from our investors. Please refer to Note 5 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail of these unfunded commitments. 
 Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we will evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 While our significant accounting policies are also described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we believe the following accounting policy, Valuation of Portfolio Investments, requires the most significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because it involves judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters. In addition, the impact of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a greater impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 The Investment Adviser applies fair value accounting in accordance with GAAP and the Valuation Policy. Fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Investments are reflected on the Fund s Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected in the Fund s Consolidated Statements of Operations as Net change in unrealized gains (losses) of investments . 
 The Investment Adviser values the Fund s portfolio investments in accordance with the Valuation Policy and the 1940 Act. For purposes of the 1940 Act, the Board has designated the Investment Adviser as the Fund s Valuation Designee. The Board provides oversight of the Investment Adviser s fair value determinations of the Fund s portfolio investments on a quarterly basis in good faith, including investments that are not publicly traded and those whose market prices are not readily available. 
 One or more independent valuation firms (each a Valuation Agent are engaged to independently value our investments, in consultation with the Investment Adviser. Our valuation procedures, which are the procedures that are followed by such Valuation Agent are set forth in more detail below: 
 1) Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at such market quotations based on the closing price indicated from independent pricing services. 
 2) Investments for which indicative prices are obtained from various pricing services and/or brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process, as described below, to determine whether the quote(s) obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP. 
 a) Bond quotes are obtained through independent pricing services. Internal reviews are performed by the personnel of the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, and/or the Investment Adviser to ensure that the quote obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP and if so, the quote is used. In the event the Investment Adviser, with the assistance of the Valuation Agent, determines that the bonds quotes are not readily available or otherwise not determinable pursuant to the Fund s valuation procedures, or not reliable, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below); and 
 b) For investments other than bonds, the personnel of the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, and/or the Investment Adviser, look at the number of quotes readily available and perform the following: 
 i) Investments for which two or more quotes are received from a pricing service are valued using the mean of the mean of the bid and ask of the quotes obtained. If quotes from pricing services differ by +/- five points or if the spread between the bid and ask for a quote is greater than 10 points, the personnel of the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, will evaluate the reasonableness of the quote, and if the quote is determined to not be representative of fair value, the personnel of the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, will use one or more of the methodologies outlined below to determine fair value; 
 ii) Investments for which one quote is received from a pricing service are validated by the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, and/or the Investment Adviser. The personnel of the 
 34 

Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, and/or the Investment Adviser, analyze the market quotes obtained using an array of valuation methods (further described below) to validate the fair value. For assets where a supporting analysis is prepared, the Valuation Agent will document the selection and appropriateness of the indices selected for yield comparison and a conclusion documenting how the yield comparison analysis supports the proposed mark. The quarterly portfolio company monitoring reports which detail the qualitative and quantitative performance of the portfolio company will also be included. If the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, and/or the Investment Adviser, are unable to sufficiently validate the quote internally and if the investment s par value exceeds a certain materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below). 
 3) Investments for which quotations are not readily available through exchanges, pricing services, brokers, or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process: 
 a) Each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the personnel of the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser; 
 b) The Valuation Agent undertakes a comprehensive valuation analysis, which includes an enterprise and/or collateral valuation, and subsequently a fundamental credit analysis and valuation with respect to both credit quality and market factors, for each of the portfolio companies or investments and provides a range of values on such investments to the Investment Adviser. The Valuation Agent also provides analyses to support its valuation methodology and calculations; 
 c) The Investment Adviser then reviews each valuation recommendation to confirm they have been calculated in accordance with the Valuation Policy; 
 d) The Investment Adviser determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser s valuation team and, where applicable, the Valuation Agent or other external service providers; and 
 e) The Board provides oversight of the valuation process in accordance with Rule 2a-5, which includes a review of the quarterly reports prepared by the Investment Adviser or the Valuation Agent and the fair valuation determinations made by the Investment Adviser. 
 For investments in revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments, the cost basis of the funded investments purchased is offset by any costs/netbacks received for any unfunded portion on the total balance committed. The fair value is also adjusted for the price appreciation or depreciation on the unfunded portion. As a result, the purchase of commitments not completely funded may result in a negative fair value until it is called and funded. 
 The values assigned to investments are based upon available information and do not necessarily represent amounts which might ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual positions are liquidated. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Fund s investments may fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuations could be material. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Discount and premium on investments purchased are accreted/amortized over the expected life of the respective investment using the effective interest method. Loan origination fees, original issue discount OID and market discounts or premiums are capitalized and amortized into interest income using the effective interest method. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income. The Fund may have loans in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind PIK interest provision. PIK interest is accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The PIK interest is added to the principal balance on the capitalization date and is generally due at maturity or when deemed by the issuer. 
 Fee Income 
 Fee income, such as structuring fees, loan monitoring, amendment, syndication, commitment, termination, and other loan fees are recognized as income when earned, either upon receipt or amortized into fee income. Upon the re-payment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan fees are recorded as fee income. 
 35 

Non-accrual 
 Investments may be placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due and/or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest is generally reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment of the ultimate outcome. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. 
 Net Realized Gain or Loss and Net Change in Unrealized Gain or Loss 
 Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on the sale of investments is calculated using the specific identification method. Net change in unrealized gain or loss will reflect the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gain or loss, when a gain or loss is realized. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 We are subject to certain financial market risks, such as interest rate fluctuations. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. Key base interest rates, such as Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), may fluctuate over time. As of September 30, 2024, 99 of investments at fair value represent floating-rate investments with a reference rate floor and none of our debt investments at fair value represent fixed-rate investments. 
 Because we may borrow money to make investments, our net investment income may be dependent on the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. In periods of increasing interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which may reduce our net investment income. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Generally, we believe higher yielding assets such as those in our investment portfolio do not necessarily follow a linear interest rate relationship and are less sensitive in price to interest rate changes than many other debt investments. Consequently, our net interest income (interest income less interest expense) is exposed to risks related to interest rate fluctuations. 
 Assuming that the interim and unaudited Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, was to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our interest rate sensitivity as of such date, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table.
