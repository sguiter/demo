General Overview Our History Our company was incorporated on March 29, 2016 in the State of Nevada. Initially we engaged in the subscription box business with a focus on offering sock subscriptions to our customers. Our subscription box was a package of a pair of socks sent directly to a customer on a recurring basis. The company was controlled and operated by Rozh Caroro from inception till April of 2022. Effective April 28, 2022, Rozh Caroro, the previous sole director, CEO and majority shareholder of the Company, entered into a stock purchase agreement and sold controlling interest of the Company to Christopher McEachnie. Rozh Caroro resigned her positions with the Company and Christopher McEachnie was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, and sole Director of the Company. His job was to increase shareholder value by looking for opportunities in the digital space. Mr. McEachnie began to seek experienced operators to assist in the development of the company. On September 21, 2022, the Company incorporated a subsidiary Caro Holdings International Ltd. and appointed Meriesha Rennalls to streamline operations, hire employees, consultants and contractors including the development of a software and ecommerce platform. Between September 2022 and December 2023, the company produced a platform that can be used for a variety of businesses including B2B, B2C and D2C. The core product is now complete and the company is soliciting clients in multiple industries. The subsidiary will continue to modify and enhance the ecommerce software for its chosen vertical markets and will allow those community to sell, market and distribute their products. The company intends to create subsidiaries in markets where it perceives a significant sales opportunity. Effective December 31, 2022 the company issued 20,000,000 shares to Noise Comms Limited and subsequently the 36,795,000 shares were returned to Treasury and were cancelled, such that indirectly Meriesha Rennalls now holds approximately 53 of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company, and as such she is able to control the election of our board of directors, approve all matters upon which shareholder approval is required and, ultimately, the direction of our Company. Prior to September 2022, we were an early-stage company and our activities had been limited to the to the formation of our business strategy and the raising of funds to support our mission. Our Current Business We are now engaged in the deployment of our B2B, B2C and Direct to Consumer (D2C) systems and methodologies where we target specific vertical markets. We look for small to mid-size brands that have a strong brick-and-mortar presence and have a desire to increase their digital presence. Our D2C system is a fully integrated 360 platform that allows marketing, analytics and e-commerce functionality wrapped around an industry-specific directory listing platform. The analytical data provides insight from multiple channels to facilitate successful marketing decisions based on a client s entire business performance. 14 Table of Contents Based on these analytics, the system can immediately deploy personalization and optimization independently, and enhance understanding of how customer interactions vary across different regions. Furthermore, our infrastructure is designed to take advantage of growth opportunities with minimal additional costs. Since September 2022, the company has been actively engaged in soliciting and identifying clients in across a broad spectrum of industries. It has also been engaged in several marketing activities to attract partners, clients and beta testers who are providing valuable feedback in order for us to ensure our system meets their needs and expectations. The Company is also looking to provide its marketplace platform to the pet care and spirit industries in the United States and the United Kingdom. The Company is also engaging in a full array of marketing activities including social media, attending trade shows and fairs, online conferences, and utilizing identified experts in affiliate marketing, pay-per-click, organic, search, engine, optimization, and social media marketing to promote D2C commerce. On December 29, 2022, the Company entered into a software license agreement with Noise Comms Ltd. for the acquisition of a Unified Communications Platform which enables multi-party communications between brands and consumers in consideration of 20,000,000 shares of common stock valued at 258,000. On November 14, 2023, the Company agreed to acquire a marketplace provider in the spirits industry, a non-affiliated corporation based in Wyoming, under which the Company will issue, on a pro-rata basis, up to 12,550,000 shares of common stock based on the company reaching future milestones in exchange for 100 of the issued and outstanding shares of the company making it a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The shares will remain in escrow with the company until those milestones. We are still a small early-stage development company with minimal revenues and limited cash on hand. We have sustained losses since inception and have relied upon loans from directors and officers and the sale of our securities for funding. We have never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or been involved in any kind of legal proceeding. Marketing, Advertising, and Promotion We believe that our systems will become one of our most important assets. Our ability to successfully create brand awareness is dependent upon our ability to address the changing needs and priorities of each brand s target customers. To that end, we plan to focus much of our marketing efforts to recruit partners. We will then apply our methodologies to better understand their customers and their needs and ensure we align our brand messages in the marketing, and the channels through which we deliver these messages, to the target customers.

For the six months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 201,900 attributed to proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes of 198,000 and promissory notes of 3,900. Cash Requirements We will require additional cash as we expand our business. Initially, to carry out our business plan, we will need to raise additional capital. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or, if we are able to raise additional capital, the terms we be acceptable to us. Currently we do not have any inventory. These conditions indicate a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We require additional debt or equity financing to have the necessary funding to continue operations and meet our obligations. We have continued to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing our financial statements. We will require additional financing in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations. There is no assurance that any party will advance additional funds to us in order to continue our future plans for operations. We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods presented. Our critical estimates include revenue recognition and intangible assets. Although we believe that these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates given a change in conditions or assumptions that have been consistently applied. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. The critical accounting policies used by management and the methodology for its estimates and assumptions are as follows: 17 Table of Contents Convertible Financial Instruments We bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free standing derivative financial instruments if certain criteria are met. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable GAAP. When we have determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments, discounts are recorded for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in the instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying Common Stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the instrument . Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on her evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, Meriesha Rennalls, our President, Chief Operating Officer, Secretary and Director, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to our company, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of continuing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2024, based on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management, and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. Management believes the above weakness constitute material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Until such time, if ever, that we remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting we expect that the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures will continue. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the period covered by this report there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 18 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
