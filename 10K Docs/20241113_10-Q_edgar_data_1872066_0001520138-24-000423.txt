and
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company has an accumulated deficit of 
and on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The net cash used in operations was and for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this report. Management cannot provide
assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt and/or
equity capital. The Company is seeking to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financing to fund its operations in the
future. Although the Company has historically raised capital from sales of common shares, there is no assurance that it will be able
to continue to do so. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management
expects that the Company will need to curtail its operations. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the
recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Level 1 Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date. 

Level 2 Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices
for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are
not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3 Inputs are unobservable inputs which
reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
based on the best available information. 

The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets
for cash, inventory, prepaid expenses, deferred offering costs, and accounts payable approximate their fair market value based on the
short-term maturity of these instruments.

related to the write down of inventory to net realizable value. During the nine months

The Company follows the accounting guidance for uncertainty
in income taxes using the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740 Income Taxes . Using that guidance,
tax positions initially need to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained
upon examination by the tax authorities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had uncertain tax positions that
qualify for either recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. Tax years that remain subject to examination are the periods
ended on December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in other
expenses. However, such interest and penalties were recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Overview 

We are in the car care accessories business, focusing
on protection products/car cleaning accessories. We were founded in 2021 as a Florida corporation. Our history dates back to 2018 when
Wolfgang Ruecker, our Founder and former CEO and car enthusiast, was confronted with a challenge: how do you keep a car with the scent
it had a brand-new right off the new car lot. The challenge led to years of collaboration with chemical engineers and mixers/perfumers
resulting in what we believe delivers the perfect sensory experience for a luxury car: the Miami Breeze Car Care Products. 

The following discussion highlights our results of
operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the
periods described and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements
of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on our financial statements
contained in this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ).
You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto. 

12-Month Outlook and Roll Out of Production 

During the next 12 months, we intend to grow production
and sales through placement of sponsored ads on Amazon.com, Facebook and other digital media platforms to create product awareness to
drive customers to our product. As of November 13, 2024, we have approximately 6,300 in cash and have estimated 740,000 for projected
expenses on SEC reporting, legal, accounting and compliance, working capital/overhead and marketing and advertising for the next 12-months.
The following provides an overview of our estimated expenses to fund our plan of operation over the next twelve months. 

ESTIMATED
 EXPENSES FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS 

SEC reporting,
 legal, accounting, audit and compliance 

120,000 

Working capital/overhead 

120,000 

Marketing and advertising 

500,000 

Total 

740,000 

Our cash resources as of November 13, 2024 will not
be sufficient for us to execute our business plan. If we do not generate sufficient cash from our intended financing activities
and sales, or if our planned digital campaigns were to fail, we will be unable to execute on our projected operations for the next 12
months. In that event, we will be forced to cut down on our planned marketing and advertising campaigns, which will negatively affect
our business, results of operations and financial condition. While we intend to engage in several equity or debt financings, there is
no assurance that these will occur, nor can we assure our shareholders that we will not be required to obtain additional financing on
terms that are not dilutive of their interests. 

Going Concern 

Our auditors have issued a going concern 
opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain
additional capital. Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements, we had a net loss of 334,979 and 644,067 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
Company has an accumulated deficit of 3,766,064 and 3,431,085 on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The net cash
used in operations was 174,141 and 296,892 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No substantial
revenues are anticipated until we have implemented our plan of operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this report. Management cannot provide assurance
that we will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. We
are seeking to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financing to fund our operations in the future. Although we have historically
raised capital from sales of common shares, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so. If we are unable to raise
additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects we will need to curtail its operations. Our financial
statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Basis of Presentation 

The financial statements contained herein have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (the U.S. GAAP and
the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

This management s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions
differ from our assumptions. While our significant accounting policies and significant estimates are more fully described in Note 1 in
the Notes to Financial Statements , we believe the following estimates are critical to the process of making significant
judgments and estimates in preparation of our financial statements. 

10 

Stock-based compensation 

Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on
the requirements of ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation , which requires recognition in the financial
statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over
the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the
vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange
for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur as permitted
under ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment.

Results of Operations

30, 2024 and 2023, we generated revenues of 5,897 and 14,747, respectively, a decrease of 8,850, or 60.0 . Since inception, a majority
of the Company s sales were generated in Europe. The decrease in sales was attributable to our lack of marketing efforts.

2023, cost of sales amounted to 793 and 1,800, respectively, a decrease of 1,007, or 55.9 . For the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, cost of sales amounted to 2,703 and 6,293, respectively, a decrease of 3,590, or 57.0 . The decrease is primarily attributable
to the decrease in sales as described above.

ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, compensation and related benefits amounted to 0 and 54,648 respectively, a decrease of 54,648,
or 100.0 . The decreases were solely attributable to a decrease in compensation and related expenses. 

Advertising and promotion

and 2023, advertising and promotion expenses amounted to 708 and 3,599, respectively, a decrease of 2,891, or 80.3 . During the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, advertising and promotion expenses amounted to 3,536 and 14,655, respectively, a decrease
of 11,119, or 75.9 . The decreases were primarily attributable to the decrease in advertising campaigns in Europe to promote our products
related to cost-cutting measures. 

Professional fees 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, we reported professional fees of 35,296 and 26,705, respectively, an increase of 8,591, or 32.2 . The increase was primarily
attributable to an increase in stock-based consulting of 20,000, and an increase in legal fees of 1,500, offset by a decrease in accounting
fees of 12,910. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, we reported professional fees of 125,373 and 410,181, respectively, a decrease of 284,808, or 69.4 . The decrease was primarily
attributable to a decrease in stock-based consulting of 268,426, and a decrease in legal fees of 19,000, offset by an increase in accounting

11 

Professional fees related parties

months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred 172,370 and 138,350 in professional fees related parties, an increase
of 34,020, or 24.6 . These increases were solely attributable to increases in fees paid to GH Bill, pursuant to a business operations
agreement with GH Bill. In connection with this agreement, we paid a monthly service fee ranging from 4,000 to 18,500 to GH Bill for
administration and back-office services. Beginning in June 2022, this monthly service fee was increased from 4,000 to 8,500 per month,
in January 2023, the monthly fee was increased to 14,500, and in August 2023, the monthly fee was increased to 18,500. In addition,
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid additional service fees of 6,500 and 3,850, respectively. 

General and administrative expenses 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, general and administrative expenses amounted to 7,415 and 11,223, a decrease of 3,808, or 33.9 . This decrease was primarily
attributable to a decrease in computer and internet expenses of 1,500, and a decrease in other general and administrative expenses of
 2,308. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, general and administrative expenses amounted to 22,270 and 32,102, a decrease of 9,832, or 30.6 . This decrease was primarily
attributable to a decrease in software and technology expenses of 5,291, a decrease in computer and internet expenses of 4,100, and
a decrease in other general and administrative expenses of 441. 

Loss from Operations 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, loss
from operation amounted to 111,295 as compared to 107,976 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3,319 or 3.1 .
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, loss from operation amounted to 334,513 as compared to 641,482 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, a decrease of 306,969 or 47.9 . The decrease was primarily a result of the changes in revenue, cost of sales and
operating expenses as discussed above. 

Other Income (Expense) 

Other income (expense) solely consisted of foreign
currency transaction gain (loss). During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported other income (expense) of 232
and (2,111), respectively, a positive change of 2,343, or 111.0 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported

ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net loss was 111,063, or (0.00) per common share (basic and diluted) and 110,087, or 0.00)
per common share (basic and diluted), respectively, an increase of 976, or 0.9 , and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, our net loss was 334,979, or (0.01) per common share (basic and diluted) and 644,067, or 0.02) per common share (basic
and diluted), respectively, a decrease of 309,088, or 48.0 . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity is the ability
of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had a negative working capital of 52,941
and 3,348 in cash as of September 30, 2024, and working capital of 176,038 and 74,889 in cash as of December 31, 2023, respectively.

The decrease in working
capital of 228,979 was primarily attributable to a decrease in current assets of 169,561 primarily due to a decrease in cash of 71,541,
a decrease in inventory of 96,795, and a decrease in prepaid expenses of 1,225, and an increase in current liabilities of 59,418 primarily
due to an increase in other current liabilities of 66,600, offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 7,182,
.. 

Our primary uses of cash have been for compensation
and related expenses, fees paid to third parties for professional services, advertising and promotion expenses, and general and administrative
expenses. All funds received have been expended in the furtherance of growing the business. We received funds from the sale of our common
stock. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in changes in our liquidity over the near to long term: 

An
 increase in working capital requirements to finance our current business; 

Product
 development fees; 

Addition
 of administrative, and sales personnel as the business grows; 

The
 cost of being a public company; 

Marketing
 expense for building brand; and 

Capital
 requirements for production capacity

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure controls and procedures 

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company s reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, evaluated our company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report
on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September
30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was
due to material weaknesses, which we identified in our report on internal control over financial reporting. 

Internal control over financial reporting 

Management s quarterly report on internal
control over financial reporting 

Our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, with the participation of our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2024. Our management s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting was based on the 2013 framework
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
evaluation, our management concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. 

13 

The ineffectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures was due to the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: 

(1) We do not have sufficient and skilled
accounting personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. To mitigate the current limited resources
and limited employees, we rely heavily on the use of external legal and accounting professionals. 

(2) a lack of adequate segregation of
duties as a result of our limited financial resources to support hiring of personnel. 

Until such time as we expand
our staff to include additional accounting and executive personnel, it is likely we will continue to report material weaknesses in our
internal control over financial reporting. 

A material weakness is a deficiency
or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Internal control over financial
reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal
control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns
resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management
override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis
by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting 

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may become
involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to
inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm business. 

We are not involved in any
pending or threatened legal proceedings that it believes could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Risk factors that affect our
business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024 Annual Report ). There have been no material changes
in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report. You should carefully consider the risks described in our Annual
Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report are
not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also
may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our
business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected.
