 days notice. Revenue derived from our ALFs and MCFs is recorded in resident fee income in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Revenue from operators and residents is recognized at lease commencement only to the extent collection is expected to be probable. This assessment is based on several qualitative and quantitative factors, including and as appropriate, the payment history, ability to satisfy its lease obligations, the value of the underlying collateral or deposit, if any, and current economic conditions. If collection is assessed to not be probable, thereafter lease income recognized is limited to amounts collected, with the reversal of any revenue recognized to date in excess of amounts received. If collection is subsequently reassessed to be probable, revenue is adjusted to reflect the amount that would have been recognized had collection always been assessed as probable. 
 Beginning in February 2021, the operator of the Company s net lease properties failed to remit contractual monthly rent obligations and the Company deemed it not probable that these obligations will be satisfied in the foreseeable future. On March 27, 2023, the Company entered into a lease forbearance and modification agreement (the Forbearance Agreement with the existing operator, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company will be entitled to receive all cash flow in excess of permitted expenses, and be required to fund any operating deficits, through 2025, subject to the terms and conditions thereof. The Company received and recorded rental income related to its net lease properties of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total property and other revenue includes variable lease revenue of million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total property and other revenue includes variable lease revenue of million and million, respectively.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded impairment losses on its operating real estate totaling million, including impairment losses of million for the Company s Oak Cottage property as a result of lower operating margins and projected future cash flows, million of impairment losses for property damage sustained by facilities within the Winterfell and Aqua portfolios and impairment losses of million to reflect the market value of land parcels within the Rochester portfolio.

 million. 
 If the Company were to fail to meet these requirements, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax and potential interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations and amounts available for distributions to its stockholders. The Company s accounting policy with respect to interest and penalties is to classify these amounts as a component of income tax expense, where applicable. The Company has assessed its tax positions for all open tax years, which include 2019 to 2023, and concluded there were no material uncertainties to be recognized. The Company may also be subject to certain state, local and franchise taxes. Under certain circumstances, federal income and excise taxes may be due on its undistributed taxable income. 
 The Company made a joint election to treat certain subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries TRS which may be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. In general, a TRS of the Company may perform services for managers/operators/residents of the Company, hold assets that the Company cannot hold directly and may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. 
 Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to taxation by federal and state authorities for the periods presented. Income taxes are accounted for by the asset/liability approach in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Deferred taxes, if any, represent the expected future tax consequences when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Such amounts arise from differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax laws and tax rates in the period which such changes are enacted. A provision for income tax represents the total of income taxes paid or payable for the current period, plus the change in deferred taxes. Current and deferred taxes are provided on the portion of earnings (losses) recognized by the Company with respect to its interest in the TRS. 
 The Company recorded an income tax expense of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax expense of approximately and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the Company s U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statements and the federal and state income tax basis of assets and liabilities as of the consolidated balance sheet date. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets (e.g., net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards) and recognizes a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. When evaluating the realizability of its deferred tax assets, the Company considers estimates of expected future taxable income, existing and projected book/tax differences, tax planning strategies available and the general and industry specific economic outlook. This realizability analysis is inherently subjective, as it requires the Company to forecast its business and general economic environment in future periods. Changes in estimate of deferred tax asset realizability, if any, are included in provision for income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company has a deferred tax asset and continues to have a full valuation allowance recognized, as there are no changes in the facts and circumstances to indicate that the Company should release the valuation allowance.

Investment in Espresso joint venture 
 Derivative Assets - Interest Rate Caps 
 The Company s interest rate caps fair values are determined using models developed by the respective counterparty that use the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The floating interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the caps are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities.

 Environmental Matters 
 The Company follows a policy of monitoring its properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist at its properties, the Company is not currently aware of any environmental liability with respect to its properties that would have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Further, the Company is not aware of any material environmental liability or any unasserted claim or assessment with respect to an environmental liability that it believes would require additional disclosure or the recording of a loss contingency. 
 General Uninsured Losses

The Company attempts to obtain appropriate policy terms, conditions, limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage and current industry practice. Disruptions in insurance markets may increase the costs of coverage and result in the Company retaining more risk, to the extent it is more commercially reasonable to do so. In addition, there are also certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts of war or other events, that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements and the risk factors in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors. References to we, us, our, or NorthStar Healthcare refer to NorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. 
 
 Overview 
 We own a diversified portfolio of seniors housing properties, including independent living facilities, or ILFs, assisted living facilities, or ALFs, and memory care facilities, or MCFs, located throughout the United States. 
 We were formed in October 2010 as a Maryland corporation and commenced operations in February 2013. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We conduct our operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 We raised 2.0 billion in total gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in our continuous, public offerings, including 232.6 million pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or our DRP, collectively referred to as our Offering. 
 The Internalization 
 From inception through October 21, 2022, we were externally managed by CNI NSHC Advisors, LLC or its predecessor, or the Former Advisor, an affiliate of NRF Holdco, LLC, or the Former Sponsor. The Former Advisor was responsible for managing our operations, subject to the supervision of our board of directors, pursuant to an advisory agreement. On October 21, 2022, we completed the internalization of our management function, or the Internalization. In connection with the Internalization, we agreed with the Former Advisor to terminate the advisory agreement. 
 
 Our Strategy 
 Our primary objective is to maximize value and generate liquidity for shareholders. The key elements of our strategy include: 
 Grow the Operating Income Generated by Our Portfolio. We are focused on growing the net operating income generated by our properties, through active portfolio management and selectively deploying capital expenditures to improve occupancy and resident rates while managing expenses, in an effort to enhance the overall value of our assets. 
 Pursue Disposition Opportunities that Maximize Value . We will pursue dispositions of assets and portfolios where we believe the disposition will achieve a desired return or strategic outcome, with the goal of maximizing value for shareholders overall. 
 
 Significant Developments 
 Transactions 
 In September 2024, we completed the sale of our investment in Trilogy REIT Holdings, LLC, or the Trilogy Investment, pursuant to the previously disclosed membership interest purchase agreement, which resulted in net cash proceeds, after transaction costs, to us of 254.0 million. 
 In October 2024, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell a property within our Rochester portfolio for a sales price of 31.5 million, subject to the terms and conditions of the purchase and sales agreement. The property is encumbered by a mortgage note payable with an outstanding principal balance of 16.9 million as of September 30, 2024. Completion of the transaction is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including satisfactory due diligence; as a result, there is no assurance that the transaction will close on the terms anticipated or at all. 
 Updated Estimated Net Asset Value Per Share 
 On October 15, 2024, upon the recommendation of the audit committee of the board of directors, or the Audit Committee, the board of directors, including all of its independent directors, approved and established an estimated value per share of our common stock based on the estimated value of our assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2024, or the 2024 NAV Per Share. The 2024 NAV Per Share of 2.96 represents a year-over-year increase of 0.32 per share, or approximately 12 , compared to the previous estimated per share value of 2.64 as of June 30, 2023. The main factors impacting the 2024 NAV Per Share were as follows: 

32 

Table of Contents 

Strong supply and demand fundamentals across the industry, combined with our strategic capital investment in our properties, resulted in significant improvements in performance across our healthcare properties, driving an increase in estimated values. 
 We completed the sale of the Trilogy Investment in September 2024 at an attractive valuation, resulting in net proceeds to us of 254.0 million, which was greater than the estimated value of the Trilogy Investment in connection with the estimated per share value as of June 30, 2023. 
 The use of available cash to fund capital projects for our operating investments, along with our general and administrative expenses, partially offset the increase in the estimated value per share resulting from the improved operating performance. 
 The estimated value of our assets and liabilities is as of a specific date and is expected to fluctuate over time in response to further events. Further, as with any valuation methodology, the methodologies used to determine the estimated value per share are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may prove later to be inaccurate or incomplete. 
 The estimated value of our assets and liabilities was determined using the guidelines established by the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives Practice Guideline 2013-01, Valuations of Publicly Registered Non-Listed REITs, except for the valuation of the Trilogy Investment that was sold on September 20, 2024 and was valued based on the net cash proceeds received from the sale. As a result, no attempt was made to value us as an enterprise, and no discounts were applied relating to general and administrative expenses, the characteristics of our leverage and other financial structures and potential closing costs associated with dispositions or other transactions. Refer to our Form 8-K filed on October 17, 2024 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for additional information. 
 
 Liquidity Update 
 Inclusive of the net proceeds generated from the sale of our Trilogy Investment, as of November 7, 2024, we have approximately 343.8 million of unrestricted cash. 
 We will evaluate over the coming months how to use these proceeds to further our primary objective, which is to maximize value and generate liquidity for stockholders. In doing so, we are taking into consideration, among other factors, our current and projected liquidity needs, near-term debt maturities, leverage strategy, the potential impact on any liquidity event we may pursue in the future and potential additional special distributions to stockholders. 
 We have not announced or adopted a plan for liquidation and are not required to liquidate by any specified date. We do not have a stated term for a liquidity event, as we believe setting a finite date for a possible, but uncertain future liquidity transaction may result in actions that are not necessarily in the best interest or within the expectations of our shareholders. 
 We continue to monitor market conditions, performance and disposition or other transactional opportunities, with the goal of providing liquidity to stockholders at the earliest opportunity without compromising on the goal of maximizing value. 
 
 Market Update 
 Seniors Housing Fundamentals 
 Current market conditions impacting property-level performance are generally favorable. Average occupancy for the senior housing industry increased for the thirteenth consecutive quarter, to 86.5 for the third quarter of 2024, up 70 basis points from the previous quarter, and still remains below the pre-pandemic average of 87.1 in March 2020. The 80+ population, a key demographic for seniors housing, is expected to grow by 24 through 2028. Supply and demand fundamentals remained strong in the third quarter of 2024, with unit inventory growth of 1.1 year-over-year and the fewest senior housing units under construction since 2014. Access to capital and cost of capital, as well as construction costs, remain significant headwinds to senior housing development (sources: NIC MAP Vision 3Q2024 Market Fundamentals Report, NIC MAP Vision: December 2023). 
 Seniors Housing Transactions 
 Market conditions affecting transactions, including asset sales, have been challenging. Public and private capital markets have been affected by a general tightening of availability of credit (including the price, terms and conditions under which financing can be obtained), higher interest rates and a general decrease in liquidity in the healthcare lending markets, which resulted in higher capitalization rates, adversely impacting property values and limiting transaction activity. With the recent interest rate cuts in September 2024, and the positive market dynamics for seniors housing industry specifically, we are optimistic that we will begin to see increased transaction activity and more robust capital markets. If market conditions do improve as anticipated,

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average occupancy for our operating investments improved by 2.1 and 1.7 , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, to 90.8 and 89.6 , respectively. The favorable senior housing market conditions and our investment of capital to enhance the facilities of our properties contributed to the increase in occupancy. With the properties approaching stabilized occupancy levels, the managers of our operating investments have been focused on implementing resident rate increases and generating higher revenues, which outpaced the impact of inflation on variable operating costs over the same period. While certain operating expenses remain elevated throughout 2024 to date, same store NOI continues to trend positively, increasing 28.4 and 18.8 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year . 
 Net Lease Investments 
 Beginning in February 2021, the operator of the four net lease properties in our Arbors portfolio has been unable to satisfy its obligations under its leases. In accordance with a forbearance and modification agreement entered into in March 2023, the operator remits rent based on the properties available cash after satisfying property-level expenses. 
 Despite occupancy and resident rate improvements realized throughout 2024 to date, the portfolio s continued sub-optimal occupancy levels and rising operating expenses resulted in limited cash flow paid to us in accordance with the operator s forbearance agreement. We continue to monitor the operator s performance and cash flows closely, as well as evaluate potential options for this portfolio. 
 The following table presents the rental income, cash reserves used to service the debt obligations for our Arbors portfolio and average resident occupancy of the underlying properties (dollars in thousands):

 Our investments include the following types of properties: 
 Independent living facilities. ILFs are properties with central dining facilities that provide services that include security, housekeeping, nutrition and laundry services. ILFs are designed specifically for independent seniors who are able to live on their own, but desire the security and conveniences of community living. ILFs typically offer several services covered under a regular monthly fee. Fees at these communities are paid from private sources. As of September 30, 2024, we had 35 ILFs in our operating investments segment. 
 Assisted living facilities. ALFs provide services that include minimal assistance for activities in daily living and permit residents to maintain some of their privacy and independence as they do not require constant supervision and assistance. Services may be bundled within one monthly fee or based on the care needs of the resident and usually include meals and dining, daily housekeeping, laundry, medical reminders and 24-hour availability of assistance. Revenues generated by ALFs primarily come from private pay sources, including private insurance, and government reimbursement programs, such as Medicaid, to a lesser extent. As of September 30, 2024, we had seven properties that are predominantly ALFs in our operating investments segment and four properties that are predominantly ALFs in our net lease investments segment. 
 Memory care facilities. MCFs offer specialized options for seniors with Alzheimer s disease and other forms of dementia. These facilities offer dedicated care and specialized programming for various conditions relating to memory loss in a secured environment. Residents require a higher level of care and more assistance with activities of daily living than in ALFs. Therefore, these facilities have staff available 24 hours a day to respond to the unique needs of their residents. Fees at these communities are paid primarily from private sources and, to a lesser extent, government reimbursement, such as Medicaid. As of September 30, 2024, we had two properties that are predominantly MCFs in our operating investments segment.

 (4) Consists primarily of interest income earned on corporate-level cash and cash equivalents. 
 Operating Investments 
 Our operating properties allow us to participate in the risks and rewards of the operations of the facilities as compared to receiving only contractual rent under a net lease. We engage independent managers to operate these facilities pursuant to management agreements, including procuring supplies, hiring and training all employees, entering into all third-party contracts for the benefit of the property, including resident/patient agreements, complying with laws and regulations, including but not limited to healthcare laws, and providing resident care and services, in exchange for a management fee. As a result, we must rely on our managers personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, risk management processes, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our operating properties efficiently and effectively. We also rely on our managers to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results in a timely manner and otherwise operate our seniors housing facilities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 44 senior housing facilities in our operating investments segment with four different managers. The following presents the facilities by property type and geographic location as of September 30, 2024:

Our management agreements generally provide for monthly management fees which are calculated based on various performance measures, including revenue, net operating income and other objective financial metrics. We are also required to reimburse our managers for expenses incurred in the operation of the properties, as well as to indemnify our managers in connection with potential claims and liabilities arising out of the operation of the properties. Our management agreements are terminable after a stated term with certain renewal rights, though we have the ability to terminate earlier upon certain events with or without the payment of a fee . 
 The following table presents a summary of the terms of our management agreements:

 (3) The manager of our Pacific Northwest portfolio, formerly known as the Avamere portfolio, is Arete Living, formerly known as Avamere Heath Services. 
 Certain of our properties in our operating investments segment are held through joint ventures, where an affiliate of the manager owns a 3 non-controlling interest, primarily to create alignment and incentives for the manager to perform. In addition, we own a 20 interest in Solstice Senior Living, LLC, or Solstice, a management platform formed with Integral Senior Living, or ISL, the manager of one of our operating investments, the Winterfell portfolio, which gives us additional rights and minority protections. 
 Net Lease Investments 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had four ALFs located in New York operated by Arcadia Management under net leases. These leases obligate Arcadia to pay a fixed rental amount and pay all property-level expenses, with a lease term that expires in August 2029. However, Arcadia has been unable to satisfy its obligations under its leases since February 2021, and instead remits rent and pays property-level expenses based on its available cash. On March 27, 2023, we entered into a forbearance agreement with Arcadia, pursuant to which we are entitled to receive all cash flow in excess of permitted expenses, and are required to fund any operating deficits, through 2025, subject to the terms and conditions thereof. As a result, we participate in the risks and rewards of this portfolio similar to our operating properties. If Arcadia performs under the forbearance agreement, it will be entitled to forgiveness of accrued and unpaid rent during the forbearance period and a potential incentive fee tied to disposition of the portfolio above a certain value. 
 We continue to monitor Arcadia s performance and cash flows closely, as well as evaluate potential options for this portfolio. 
 Unconsolidated Investments 
 Until September 20, 2024, we owned a 24.0 minority interest in the Trilogy Investment, which indirectly owns 126 integrated senior health campuses, providing services associated with ILFs, ALFs, MFCs and skilled nursing facilities, across the Midwest. On September 20, 2024, we completed the sale of our Trilogy Investment, which generated net proceeds to us of 254.0 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our remaining unconsolidated investment is our 20.0 minority interest in Solstice, the management platform formed with ISL to exclusively manage one of our operating investments, the Winterfell portfolio . 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect 

38 

Table of Contents 

the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
 Certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s subjective and complex judgments, and for which the impact of changes in estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements. We believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made, based upon information available to us at that time. 
 For a summary of our accounting policies, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements. 
 
 Impairment 
 We believe impairment to be a critical accounting estimate based on the nature of our operations and/or because it requires significant management judgment and assumptions. Our investments are reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments may be impaired or that carrying value may not be recoverable. In conducting these reviews, we consider macroeconomic factors, including healthcare sector conditions, together with asset and market specific circumstances, among other factors. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value. Fair values can be estimated based upon the income capitalization approach, using net operating income and applying indicative capitalization and discount rates or sales comparison approach, using what other purchasers and sellers in the market have agreed to as price for comparable investments. 
 Operating Investments and Net Lease Investments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded impairment losses on our operating real estate totaling 3.7 million, including impairment losses of 3.0 million for our Oak Cottage property as a result of lower operating margins and projected future cash flows, 0.4 million of impairment losses for property damage sustained by facilities within our Winterfell and Aqua portfolios and impairment losses of 0.3 million to reflect the market value of land parcels within our Rochester portfolio. 
 Accumulated impairment losses totaled 166.2 million for operating real estate that we continue to hold as of September 30, 2024. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information regarding impairment recorded in prior years. 
 Unconsolidated Investments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not record impairment on our investments in unconsolidated ventures.

 Rochester Sub-Portfolio 
 In October 2023, as a result of the payment default in July 2023 on seven individual mortgage notes payable, or the Rochester Sub-Portfolio Loan, Fannie Mae, as the lender, filed a complaint seeking the appointment of a receiver and foreclosure on the seven underlying healthcare real estate properties, or the Rochester Sub-Portfolio, and to enforce its rights in its collateral under the loan documents. On October 30, 2023, the properties underlying the Rochester Sub-Portfolio Loan were placed into a receivership. Although we continue to have legal ownership of the Rochester Sub-Portfolio until transferred to Fannie Mae or its designee, the receiver now has effective control of the properties and, as of the date of the receivership order, we discontinued recognizing revenues and expenses related to the Rochester Sub-Portfolio and derecognized the properties and related assets from our financial statements. However, until legal ownership of the Rochester Sub-Portfolio is transferred and the associated debt extinguished, we continue to recognize liabilities associated with the Rochester Sub-Portfolio Loan. As of September 30, 2024, we continue to own all of the properties in the Rochester Sub-Portfolio. 
 We discontinued recognizing property revenues and expenses for the Rochester Sub-Portfolio as of October 30, 2023, the date of the receivership order. As a result, we did not recognize property revenues and expenses for the Rochester Sub-Portfolio during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a full three and nine months of activity presented for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

debt declined as a result of continued principal amortization and a decrease in the average mortgage notes principal balances as compared to September 30, 2023. Interest expense on floating-rate debt increased primarily due to a mortgage payable secured by properties within Aqua portfolio converting to a floating-rate loan from a lower yielding fixed-rate loan in February 2024. 
 Interest expense for the Rochester Sub-Portfolio Loan increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year due to its floating interest rate and the recognition of default interest, which will continue to accrue until the loan is extinguished. 
 Transaction Costs 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, t ransaction costs consisted primarily of l egal and professional fees incurred for corporate strategic initiatives. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, t ransaction costs consisted primarily of l egal and professional fees incurred for investment activity and costs incurred in connection with the Internalization and the transition of services and systems previously provided by the Former Advisor. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 Corporate cost savings of 0.1 million and 1.2 million were realized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year , primarily due to a reduction in corporate insurance premiums and other professional services.

 Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 2024 2023 ILF properties 6,767 6,344 6.7 20,075 18,253 10.0 ALF/MCF properties 1,650 1,652 (0.1) 4,905 4,930 (0.5) Net lease properties 684 729 (6.2) 2,051 2,187 (6.2) Same store subtotal 9,101 8,725 4.3 27,031 25,370 6.5 Rochester Sub-Portfolio 1,028 (100.0) 3,649 (100.0) Properties sold 95 (100.0) 286 (100.0) Total depreciation and amortization 9,101 9,848 (7.6) 27,031 29,305 (7.8) 
 On a same store basis, depreciation and amortization expense increased 0.4 million and 1.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, primarily as a result of additional capital improvements completed at the facilities within our Winterfell portfolio. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense at our net lease properties as a result of impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023, which reduced building depreciation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Impairment Loss 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , impairment losses on operating real estate totaled 0.2 million and 3.7 million, respectively. Refer to Impairment for additional discussion. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we recorded impairment losses on our operating real estate totaling 38.7 million. In addition, we recorded impairment losses on our investment in the Espresso joint venture totaling 4.7 million. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other income, net consisted primarily of capital expenditure reimbursements from the state of Oregon s Long-Term Care Capital Improvement and Emergency Preparedness Program received and recognized by facilities within our Pacific Northwest portfolio (formerly known as the Avamere portfolio). 
 Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other 
 In September 2024, in connection with the sale of our Trilogy Investment, we recognized a gain totaling 128.6 million .

Table of Contents 

In June 2023, in connection with the sale of two investments in unconsolidated ventures, we realized a loss totaling 1.3 million. In addition, as a result of the sale, we reclassified the accumulated foreign currency losses, totaling 3.3 million, previously recorded through other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of equity to realized gain (loss) on investments and other . 
 Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Ventures 
 The following table presents the equity in earnings (losses) of our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Trilogy 1,100 (146) (853.4) 3,005 454 561.9 Solstice (26) 19 (236.8) (102) (41) 148.8 Subtotal 1,074 (127) 35.4 2,903 413 (14.8) Espresso N/A 9,228 (100.0) Investments sold in 2023 N/A (16,236) (100.0) Total equity in earnings (losses) 1,074 (127) 35.4 2,903 (6,595) (105.3) 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , e quity in earnings (losses) related to our Trilogy Investment represent our proportionate share of earnings through the date of the sale of our ownership interest on September 20, 2024. 
 On June 30, 2023, we elected the fair value option to account for our investment in the Espresso joint venture, which resulted in no equity in earnings (losses) recorded subsequent to the accounting policy election. 
 We did not receive any distributions from our unconsolidated ventures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 24.1 million received during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which were primarily from sales transactions in the Espresso joint venture . 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We consider certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Funds from Operations, or FFO, Modified Funds from Operations, or MFFO, and NOI, to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not equivalent or an alternative to net income (loss) or cash flow provided by operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the U.S. GAAP methodology in evaluating our operating performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
 We compute FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciable property, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment on depreciable property owned directly or indirectly and after adjustments for unconsolidated ventures. 
 Due to certain of the unique features of publicly-registered, non-traded REITs, the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives, or IPA, an industry trade group, standardized a performance measure known as MFFO and recommends the use of MFFO for such REITs. Management believes MFFO is a useful performance measure to evaluate our business and further believes it is important to disclose MFFO in order to be consistent with the IPA recommendation and other non-traded REITs. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, nor any other regulatory body has approved the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate MFFO. In the future, the SEC or another regulatory body may decide to standardize permitted adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we may need to adjust our calculation and characterization of MFFO. 
 We define MFFO in accordance with the concepts established by the IPA. Our computation of MFFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not calculate MFFO using the same method MFFO is calculated using FFO. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a computation made by analysts and investors to measure a real estate company s operating performance. The IPA s definition of MFFO excludes from FFO the following items: 
 acquisition fees and expenses; 

43 

Table of Contents 

non-cash amounts related to straight-line rent and the amortization of above or below market and in-place intangible lease assets and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from an accrual basis of accounting under U.S. GAAP to a cash basis of accounting); 
 amortization of a premium and accretion of a discount on debt investments; 
 non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments that meet the specified criteria identified in the rules and regulations of the SEC; 
 realized gains (losses) from the early extinguishment of debt; 
 realized gains (losses) on the extinguishment or sales of hedges, foreign exchange, securities and other derivative holdings except where the trading of such instruments is a fundamental attribute of our business; 
 unrealized gains (losses) from fair value adjustments on real estate securities, including CMBS and other securities, interest rate swaps and other derivatives not deemed hedges and foreign exchange holdings; 
 unrealized gains (losses) from the consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting; 
 adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations; and 
 adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis as above. 
 MFFO does have certain limitations. For instance, realized gains (losses) from acquisitions and dispositions and other adjustments listed above are not reported in MFFO, even though such realized gains (losses) and other adjustments could affect our operating performance and cash available for distribution. Any mark-to-market or fair value adjustments may be based on many factors, including current operational or individual property issues or general market or overall industry conditions. Investors should note that while impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flow and the relatively limited term of a non-traded REIT s anticipated operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flow prior to any liquidity event. MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value, since impairment is taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO. In addition, MFFO may not be a useful measure of our operating performance or as a comparable measure to other typical non-traded REITs if we do not continue to operate in a similar manner to other non-traded REITs.

 Net Operating Income 
 We believe NOI provides useful information to stockholders and provides our management with a performance measure to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies between periods on a consistent basis. We define NOI as property and other revenues, less property operating expenses.

 For additional information regarding our operating investments segment, refer to Our Investments above and for financial information refer to Note 11, Segment Reporting in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our current principal liquidity needs are to fund: (i) operating expenses, including corporate general and administrative expenses; (ii) principal and interest payments on our borrowings and other commitments; and (iii) capital expenditures. 
 Our current primary sources of liquidity include the following: (i) cash on hand; (ii) proceeds that may be generated from investment sales and realizations; and (iii) cash flow generated by our investments. 
 As of November 7, 2024, we had approximately 343.8 million of unrestricted cash and currently believe that our capital resources are sufficient to meet our capital needs for the following 12 months. 
 Cash From Operations 
 We primarily generate cash flow from operations through net operating income from our operating properties and rental income from our net lease properties. Net cash provided by operating activities was 16.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We are exposed to various operational risks, including rising labor costs, inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates, at substantially all of our properties. We expect that these factors will continue to materially impact our cash flow generated by our investments. 
 Borrowings 
 We typically have financed our investments with medium to long-term, non-recourse mortgage loans, though our borrowing levels and terms vary depending upon the nature of the assets and the related financing. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 13.3 million and 26.1 million in recurring principal and interest payments, respectively, on borrowings. Excluding the Rochester Sub-Portfolio Loan, we had 780.0 million of consolidated asset-level borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 We have 670.2 million of borrowings that mature in 2025, including 573.5 million of borrowings collateralized by our Winterfell portfolio. We may be unable to extend or refinance these borrowings without a significant pay down of existing loan balances. Our ability to refinance these borrowings and/or sell assets will be significantly impacted by market conditions, over which we have no control. Further, given the nature of our assets and the materiality of this portfolio, we may not be able to respond quickly to changes in market conditions. Even if we are able to extend or refinance these borrowings, it will likely be at a significantly higher interest rate. 

46 

Table of Contents 

Our charter limits us from incurring borrowings that would exceed 300.0 of our net assets. We cannot exceed this limit unless any excess in borrowing over such level is approved by a majority of our independent directors. We would need to disclose any such approval to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with the justification for such excess. An approximation of this leverage limitation is 75.0 of our assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation. As of September 30, 2024, our leverage was 54.6 of our assets, other than intangibles, before deducting non-cash reserves and depreciation. 
 For additional information regarding our borrowings, including principal repayments, timing of maturities and loans currently in default, refer to Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 5, Borrowings in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements. 
 Capital Expenditures Activities 
 We are responsible for capital expenditures for our operating properties and may also fund capital expenditures for our net lease properties. We have made significant investments in capital expenditures to increase operating income and enhance the overall value of certain properties and in order to maintain market position, functional and operating standards. We will continue to invest going forward, although we expect aggregate spending to decrease in the near-term compared to 2023 and prior years. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used for capital expenditures at our investments totaled 11.3 million. 
 Realization and Disposition of Investments 
 We will pursue dispositions of assets and portfolios where we believe the disposition will achieve a desired return or strategic outcome, improve our liquidity position and generate value for shareholders. We will continue to monitor the interest rate environment and related impact on the capital markets and transaction activity, so we are well positioned to execute on our disposition strategy as and when compelling opportunities become available. 
 On September 20, 2024, we completed the sale of our Trilogy Investment to affiliates of American Healthcare REIT, Inc., or AHR, in accordance with the Option Agreement, which resulted in net cash proceeds, after transaction costs, to us of 254.0 million. 
 Distributions 
 To continue to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually dividends equal to at least 90 of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to stockholders. We have generated net operating losses for tax purposes and, accordingly, are currently not required to make distributions to our stockholders to qualify as a REIT. Refer to Distributions Declared and Paid and Liquidity Update for further information regarding our distributions. 
 Based on the current forecasted cash flow of our investments and cash needs to operate our business, we do not anticipate paying recurring dividends. Instead, the board of directors will evaluate special distributions in connection with any sales and other realizations of investments on a case-by-case basis based on, among other factors, current and projected liquidity needs. 
 Share Repurchases 
 We adopted a share repurchase program effective August 7, 2012, which enabled stockholders to sell their shares to us in limited circumstances and could be amended, suspended, or terminated at any time. On April 7, 2020, our board of directors suspended all repurchases under our existing share repurchase program effective April 30, 2020 in order to preserve capital and liquidity. We do not currently anticipate resuming the share repurchase program. If we have sufficient capital available, at this stage in our life cycle, we believe that returning capital to stockholders through special distributions, rather than repurchases, is a better use of that capital. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows (dollars in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) Cash flows provided by (used in): 2024 2023 Operating activities 16,739 13,066 3,673 Investing activities 255,225 (14,295) 269,520 Financing activities (24,232) (15,464) (8,768) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 247,732 (16,693) 264,425 

47 

Table of Contents 

Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities improved from 13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 16.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Increases in occupancy and rates at our operating investments resulted in higher rent and resident fees collected and the Rochester Sub-Portfolio Loan default in July 2023 resulted in lower cash interest payments in the current period. We did not receive any distributions from unconsolidated investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 10.6 million received and classified as operating cash flows in the corresponding period of last year. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our cash flows from investing activities are primarily proceeds from investment dispositions, including distributions received from our investments in unconsolidated investments that have been classified as investing cash flows, net of any capital expenditures. We continue to invest capital into our operating portfolios in order to maintain market position and enhance overall asset value, although we expect aggregate spending to decrease in the near-term as compared to 2023 and 2022. Net cash provided by investing activities increased from 14.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 255.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the net proceeds generated from the sale of our Trilogy Investment. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities were primarily principal amortization and repayments of our mortgage notes payable, which totaled 24.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and includes the repayment of a 10.9 million mortgage note for a property sold within our Rochester Portfolio. Mortgage principal amortization totaled 15.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we are not dependent on the use of any off-balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity. We have made investments in unconsolidated ventures. Refer to Note 4, Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements. for a discussion of such unconsolidated ventures in our consolidated financial statements. In each case, our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment. 
 
 Distributions Declared and Paid 
 From inception through September 30, 2024, we declared 530.9 million in distributions and generated cumulative FFO of 202.0 million. From April 5, 2013, the date of our first investment, through December 31, 2017, we paid monthly distributions in an amount that was equivalent to an annualized distribution of 0.675 per share of our common stock. In order to better align the distribution with anticipated cash flows from operations, beginning in January 1, 2018 through January 31, 2019, we paid monthly distributions in an amount that was equivalent to an annualized distribution of 0.3375 per share of our common stock. Effective February 1, 2019, our board of directors stopped recurring distributions in order to preserve capital and liquidity. In May 2022, we paid a special distribution in the amount of 0.50 per share of our common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not declare any distributions to stockholders. 
 While we do not anticipate recurring dividends in the near future, in light of the cash flow generated by our investments as compared to our capital expenditure needs and debt service obligations, our management and board of directors will evaluate special distributions in connection with asset sales and other realizations of our investments on a case-by-case basis based on, among other factors, current and projected liquidity needs, opportunities for investment in our assets (such as capital expenditure and de-levering opportunities) and other strategic initiatives. 
 To the extent distributions are paid from sources other than FFO, the ownership interest of our public stockholders may be diluted. Future distributions declared and paid may exceed FFO and cash flow provided by operations. FFO, as defined, may not reflect actual cash available for distributions. 
 
 Related Party Arrangements 
 Former Advisor 
 In connection with the Internalization, on October 21, 2022, the advisory agreement was terminated and, along with the Operating Partnership and the Former Advisor, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement, or TSA, to facilitate an orderly transition of the management of our operations. As of December 31, 2023, the TSA was effectively terminated. 

48 

Table of Contents 

 Prior to the Internalization, the Former Advisor was responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying, acquiring, originating and asset managing investments on our behalf. For such services, to the extent permitted by law and regulations, the Former Advisor received fees and reimbursements from us. Pursuant to the advisory agreement, the Former Advisor could defer or waive fees in its discretion. 
 Investments in Joint Ventures 
 Solstice, the manager of our Winterfell portfolio, is a joint venture between affiliates of ISL, which owns 80.0 , and us, which owns 20.0 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized property management fee expense of 5.4 million payable to Solstice related to the Winterfell portfolio. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The principal market risks affecting us are interest rate risk and inflation risk. These risks are dependent on various factors beyond our control, including monetary and fiscal policies, domestic and international economic conditions and political considerations. Our market risk sensitive assets, liabilities and related derivative positions (if any) are held for investment and not for trading purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We have exposure to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. To limit this exposure, we have generally sought long-term debt financing on a fixed-rate basis. However, certain of our borrowings are subject to variable-rate interest. 
 The following table presents a summary of our borrowings as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 
 Borrowing Type Loan Count Interest Rate (1) 
 Principal Outstanding of Outstanding Debt Fixed-rate debt 42 4.2 735,902 83.6 Floating-rate debt 2 7.0 44,059 5.0 Rochester Sub-Portfolio Loan (2) 
 7 7.6 99,786 11.4 Total/Weighted Average 51 4.7 879,747 100.0 
 _______________________________________ 
 (1) Represents the weighted average interest rate effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 (2) The Rochester Sub-Portfolio Loan is comprised of seven individual floating-rate mortgage notes payable in payment default, cross-collateralized and subject to cross-default, five ILFs and two ALFs, which have been placed into a receivership. 
 When borrowing at variable rates, we seek the lowest margins available and evaluate hedging opportunities. The interest rate on our floating-rate borrowings is a fixed spread over an index such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, and typically reprices every 30 days. For our floating-rate borrowings, we have entered into interest rate caps that involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up-front premium. As of September 30, 2024, excluding the Rochester Sub-Portfolio Loan, one of our two floating-rate loans is hedged with a contract in place through the third quarter of 2025 and had an effectively capped interest rate of 5.6 . Based on market interest rates of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase on the interest rate for our floating-rate loan without an interest rate cap in place would increase our interest expense by 0.3 million. 
 Increases in market interest rates typically result in a decrease in the fair value of fixed-rate borrowings, while decreases in market interest rates typically result in an increase in the fair value of fixed-rate borrowings. While changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed-rate borrowings, these changes do not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed-rate borrowings. Therefore, interest rate risk does not have a significant impact on our fixed-rate borrowings until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing. If we seek to refinance our fixed-rate borrowings, whether at maturity or otherwise, and interest rates have risen, our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs. Conversely, lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs. Further, the fair value of the real estate collateral for our borrowings may be negatively impacted by rising interest rates. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Many of our costs are subject to inflationary pressures. These include labor, repairs and maintenance, food costs, utilities, insurance and other operating costs. Higher rates of inflation affecting the economy may substantially affect the operating margins of our investments. While our managers have an ability to partially offset cost inflation by increasing the rates charged to residents, this ability is often limited by competitive conditions, affordability and timing, which may lag behind cost volatility. Therefore, there can be no assurance that cost increases can be offset by increased rates charged to residents in real time or that increased rates will not result in occupancy declines.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information relating to us and our subsidiaries required to be disclosed in reports that are filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, management conducted an evaluation as required under Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). 
 Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports. 
 
 Part II Other Information . 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We may be involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although we are unable to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in the opinion of management, any current legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 If we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow provided by operations, we will have less cash available for investments and your overall return may be reduced. 
 Our organizational documents permit us to pay distributions from any source, including offering proceeds, borrowings or sales of assets or we may make distributions in the form of taxable stock dividends. We have not established a limit on the amount of proceeds we may use to fund distributions. We have funded distributions in the past in excess of our cash flow from operations and may continue to do so in the future. If we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow provided by operations, such as using the proceeds of asset sales, our book value may be negatively impacted and the value of our shares will be reduced. In May 2022, we paid a special distribution to stockholders of 0.50 per share of common stock using proceeds from asset sales and not cash flow provided by operations. We did not declare any distributions during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 
 We adopted a share repurchase program in 2012, which enabled shareholders to sell their shares to us in limited circumstances and could be amended, suspended and terminated by our board of directors at any time in their sole discretion (subject to certain notice requirements set forth in the share repurchase program). On April 7, 2020, in accordance with the terms of our share repurchase program, our board of directors suspended all repurchases under the share repurchase program effective April 30, 2020 in order to preserve capital and liquidity and does not currently anticipate resuming the share repurchase program. 
 We did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024.
