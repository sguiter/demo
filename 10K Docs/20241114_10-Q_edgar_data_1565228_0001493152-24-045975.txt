million loss from operations and million of cash used in operating activities. As of September
30, 2024, the Company had million in working capital, million in accumulated deficits, and million in cash and cash
equivalents. 

During the first quarter of 2024, the Company invested
approximately million of its cash reserves in federal bonds intended to be held to maturity. No additional investments were made
during the second and third quarters of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held investments in federal bonds valued at million,
intended to be held to maturity, primarily seeking to generate investment income. 

Various
factors influence the Company s liquidity needs, including economic conditions such as inflation and currency exchange rates, competitive
dynamics within current and target markets, potential strategic acquisitions, and market strategy adjustments. Additionally, research
and development activities, regulatory developments, and technological advancements could further impact liquidity requirements. Given
these considerations, management believes that the Company has sufficient resources to continue operations for at least 12 months from
the filing date of these financial statements. 

Restructuring
Initiatives : 

On
November 12, 2024, the Board approved a plan to restructure certain operations of the business. The Company has initiated a series
of restructuring actions that include a reduction in workforce and the termination of the U.K. and Poway, California manufacturing
operations, and the transfer of these manufacturing activities to Mount Olive, New Jersey. The initiatives aim to enhance the
Company s financial position by eliminating underperforming product lines, redundant manufacturing facilities, and associated
headcount. 

The Company expects associated one-time costs
saving related to severance, lease termination, and other restructuring initiatives to total approximately 
million. The majority of these savings will be realized in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. The Company
expects to realize additional expense savings of approximately 
million throughout 2025. There is no assurance the Company will be able to achieve these objectives. The actual results may differ
from these estimates.

 NOTE 9 LEASES (continued) 

During those periods, there were no significant adjustments
to the straight-line rental expenses. Most costs accounted for in each period were reflected in the cash spent on operating activities,
mainly covering payments for the basic rent of offices and warehouses. Additionally, we can renew certain leases at various intervals,
though we are not obligated to. Expenses associated with short-term leases, taxes, and variable service fees were minimal. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company reported Right-of-Use
(ROU) assets totaling approximately million on the balance sheet net of million in accumulated amortization. In addition, the
Company recognized operating lease liabilities of approximately million, allocating million as current and million as non-current,
as noted on the balance sheet. The weighted average lease term remaining as of September 30, 2024, was years, with leases expiring
between , and the weighted average discount rate was as of September 30, 2024. 

Poway, CA Lease Renewal and Classification Correction 

On February 12, 2024, Vislink Poway, LLC signed a
renewal agreement with CPI Apartment Fund 10 LLC for the premises at 13475 Danielson Street, Suite 100, 130, and 160, Poway, California.
The renewal agreement was initially accounted for based on preliminary terms indicating a lease commencement on March 14, 2024, with an
end date of . Consequently, a Right-of-Use (ROU) asset of approximately and a lease liability of approximately
 were recognized in the first quarter of 2024. 

The final signed lease agreement was obtained during
the third quarter of 2024. It confirms a one-year lease term beginning on April 1, 2024, and ending on March 31, 2025. Since the finalized
lease term is months, it qualifies as a short-term lease under ASC 842, and no ROU asset or lease liability is required to be recorded. 

The Company corrected this by removing the previously
recognized ROU asset and lease liability. The Poway, California lease is now accurately accounted for as a short-term lease, with monthly
payments of expensed on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.

23, 2023, to adopt the 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the 2023 Plan ), which will enable it to continue to grant equity-based
compensation awards under a shareholder-approved plan to employees (including officers), non-employee consultants, non-employee directors,
and affiliates. The 2023 Plan replaces the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan, 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan, and 2017 Incentive Compensation
Plan. The Company has ceased granting awards under the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan, 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan, and 2017 Incentive
Compensation Plan. The Company reserves shares of its common stock for delivery under the 2023 Plan. The 2023 Plan rewards eligible
participants for contributing to the Company s success and encourages retaining and recruiting qualified personnel. The Company s
Board of Directors and Compensation Committee will administer the 2023 Plan. 

The 2023 Plan generally grants awards without consideration
other than prior and future service. The Company s compensation committee may grant awards under the 2023 Plan either alone or in
addition to, in tandem with, or as a substitute for any other award granted under the 2023 Plan or other Company plans. It is important
to note, however, that if a SAR is granted in conjunction with an ISO, the grant date and term of the SAR and ISO must be the same, and
the exercise price of the SAR cannot be lower than the exercise price of the ISO. A written award agreement between us and the grantee
will outline the material terms of the award.

Results of Operations 

Comparison for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, and 2023 

Revenue 

In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the
revenue was 7.1 million compared to 7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of 0.1 million
or 1 . In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the revenue was 24.4 million compared to 19.4 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 5.0 million or 26 . 

This growth is attributable to expanded market reach,
improved operational efficiencies, new product development, and the benefits of integrating the UK manufacturing operations into our U.S.
facilities. 

Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses 

Cost of Components and Personnel 

In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the
cost of components and personnel was 3.5 million compared to 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing
an increase of 0.2 million or 6 . In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the cost of components and personnel was 10.8 million
compared to 9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 1.8 million or 20 . 

The cost of components and personnel increase is
driven by our expanded market reach and new product development, which supports the Company s growth and operational strategy.
This change reflects the strategic decisions and initiatives undertaken in previous periods and the increase in revenue. In the latter
half of 2022, the Company discontinued several underperforming product lines. This decision allowed us to reallocate resources to more
profitable and promising products, contributing to overall operational efficiency. Additionally, we relocated Vislink s U.K. manufacturing
division to the United States to consolidate manufacturing operations, reduce logistics costs, and improve supply chain management. The
increase in revenue has driven higher production demands, necessitating additional components and personnel to meet market needs. The
expanded market reach and introduction of new products have also required investment in skilled labor and advanced components to maintain
a competitive advantage and support our growth strategy. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses encompass the
operational costs incurred in running the business daily, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, payroll taxes, trade
shows, marketing initiatives, promotional materials, professional services, facilities, general liability insurance, travel, and other
expenses associated with maintaining public company status. 

In the three months ending September 30, 2024, the
general and administrative expenses were 5.1 million compared to 4.8 million for the three months ending September 30, 2023, representing
an increase of 0.3 million or 6 . In the nine months ending September 30, 2024, the general and administrative expenses were 16.3 million
compared to 14.5 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 1.8 million or 12 . 

The three-month increase of 0.3 million is predominantly
due to 0.5 million in salaries and benefits and 0.2 million in miscellaneous taxes. The increase was partially offset by a decrease
of 0.3 million in miscellaneous expenses, 0.2 million in legal fees, and 0.1 million each in computer and consulting expenses. The
nine-month increase of 1.8 million is primarily attributable to 1.6 million in salaries and benefits, 0.3 million in commissions,
 0.2 million each in advertising, bad debt, and director s fees, partially offset by a decrease of 0.7 million in stock-based
compensation. The nine-month increase of 1.8 million is primarily attributable to 2.6 million in salaries and benefits, partially offset
by a decrease of 0.8 million. 

Research and Development 

In the three months ending September 30, 2024, the
research and development expenses were 1.2 million compared to 0.8 million for the three months ending September 30, 2023, representing
an increase of 0.4 million or 50 . In the nine months ending September 30, 2024, the research and development expenses were 2.9 million
compared to 2.5 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 0.4 million or 16 . 

The three-month increase of 0.4 million is predominantly
due to 0.3 million each in professional fees and salaries and benefits. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in consulting
fees of 0.1 million. The nine-month increase of 0.4 million is primarily attributable to 0.3 million in research and 0.2 million
in professional fees, partially offset by a decrease of 0.1 million in consulting fees. 

22 

Amortization and Depreciation 

In the three months ending September 30, 2024, amortization
and depreciation expenses remained consistent at 0.3 million, unchanged from the three months ending September 30, 2023. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, amortization and depreciation expenses increased slightly by 0.1 million to 1.0 million, compared to
 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

This stability over the three-month period and the
slight increase over the nine-month period reflect minimal changes in the net book value of our intangible and fixed assets, as the Company
does not regularly engage in material procurements of these assets. 

Other 

Dividend and Interest Income 

In the three months ending September 30, 2024, dividend
and interest income was 0.2 million, compared to 0.3 million for the three months ending September 30, 2023, representing a decrease
of 0.2 million or 67 . In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, dividend and interest income were 0.5 million compared to 0.9 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of 0.4 million or 44 . 

The decrease in dividend and interest income is partly
due to the redemption of government-backed bonds during the first quarter of 2024. 

Net Loss 

In the three months ending September 30, 2024, the
Company had a net loss of 3.0 million compared to a net loss of 1.9 million in the three months ending September 30, 2023, or an increase
in a net loss of 1.0 million or 53 . The Company s net loss for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, was 6.2 million, compared
to 6.8 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2023, or a decrease in a net loss of 0.6 million or 9 . 

The net loss increased by 1.0 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in revenue of 0.1 million, an increase of 0.4 million in research and development
expenses, 0.3 million in general and administrative expenses, and 0.2 million in cost of components and personnel. 

The net loss decreased by 0.6 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in revenue of 5.0 million, offset by increases of 1.8 million each in
cost of components and personnel, and general and administrative expenses, as well as 0.4 million in research and development expenses. 

This
improvement is attributable to more efficient expense management, including renegotiating contracts with suppliers, optimizing our workforce,
 implementing cost-saving measures, and increasing revenue. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company incurred an approximate 7.4 million loss from operations and 4.0 million of cash used in operating activities. As of September
30, 2024, the Company had 27.1 million in working capital, 315.5 million in accumulated deficits, and 3.2 million in cash and cash
equivalents. 

23 

During the first quarter of 2024, the Company invested
approximately 0.9 million of its cash reserves in federal bonds intended to be held to maturity. No additional investments were made
during the second and third quarters of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held investments in federal bonds valued at 6.0 million,
intended to be held to maturity, primarily seeking to generate investment income. 

Many factors may impact the Company s liquidity
requirements. These may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, including inflation, foreign exchange, fluctuations, the
markets in which we compete or wish to enter, strategic acquisitions, our market strategy, our research and development activities, regulatory
matters, and technology and product innovations. The Company believes it will have sufficient funds to continue its operations for at
least 12 months from the filing date of these financial statements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

As of the date of the filing of this quarterly report,
we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The location of additional information about these critical accounting policies
is in the Management s Discussion Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

acquisition. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities of approximately
 0.3 million and 0.4 million during the nine months ended September 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, was principally attributable to principal payments

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material
changes to the information related to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about the market risk provided in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
main tain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
These controls and procedures also ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decision-making regarding required disclosures. 

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls
and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. We apply our judgment in evaluating whether the benefits of the controls and procedures that
we adopt outweigh their costs. 

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act,
an evaluation as of September 30, 2024, was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024, were not effective due to the material weakness described below. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

As of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024,
our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In their assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that such control was ineffective and that there continue to be control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses because (i)
we currently do not employ the appropriate number of accounting personnel to ensure (a) we maintain proper segregation of duties, and
(b) conduct a tolerable risk assessment, and (ii) we have not adequately documented a complete assessment of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting. Considering these material weaknesses, we performed additional
procedures and analyses as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared following U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles GAAP ). 

Changes to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Although we have continued our un-remediated efforts
in connection with identified material weaknesses, the material weakness, as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period
ended December 31, 2023, has not been fully remediated. As we continue to remediate the material weakness in our internal controls, we
made changes to our internal controls during our most recently completed fiscal quarter, including changes to enhance the supervisory
review of our accounting procedures. 

Notwithstanding the continuing and unresolved material
weakness, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows for the fiscal periods presented in this Quarterly Report in conformity with GAAP. 

Except for the material weakness and remediation efforts,
there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act, that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
