 and the remaining amount with credit instruments. Currently, the Company has pledged the value of its Lima office complex for the of the guarantee and with a stand-by letter of credit for the other as a security for this obligation. Through January 2024, the Company has provided total guarantees of million. On July 20, 2021, the Peruvian Government published Law 31347, which requires companies in the production stage to set aside additional guarantees for progressive closure of its operations. The resources that back these guarantees will be returned to the Company when activities cease and the regulatory agency verifies that all closure measures have been satisfactorily completed. Under this Law, companies must include activities for environmental remediation within the closure schedule and assume costs associated with environmental impacts that are identified during audits. As of September 30, 2024, the regulation attached to this Law had yet to be published. The Company is currently evaluating the possible financial impact of the Law but cannot fully estimate the magnitude until the Law s regulation is published. The closure cost recognized for this liability includes the cost, as outlined in its closure plans, of dismantling the Toquepala and Cuajone concentrators, the Ilo smelter and refinery, and the shops and auxiliary facilities at the units. In March 2016, MINEM approved the Mining Closure Plan for the Toquepala expansion project and the revised closure plans for the Cuajone mine and the Ilo facilities were approved in January and October 2019, respectively. The closure plan for the Tia Maria project was approved in February 2017. The Company, however, has not recorded a retirement obligation for the project because the work on the project is on hold. The Company believes that under these circumstances, the recording of a retirement obligation is not appropriate. In April 2024, the Company adjusted its estimate for the asset retirement obligation due to an update of the closure plan for its Ilo facility. The effect was a decrease of million in the asset retirement obligation. Mexican operations: The Company has recognized an estimated asset retirement obligation for its mining properties in Mexico as part of its environmental commitment. Even though there is currently no enacted law, statute, ordinance, written or oral contract requiring the Company to carry out mine closure and environmental remediation activities, the Company believes that a constructive obligation presently exists based on the remediation requirements caused by the closure of any facility. The overall cost recognized for mining closure in Mexico includes the estimated costs of dismantling concentrators, smelter and refinery plants, shops and other facilities. In the nine months of 2024, the Company adjusted its estimate for the asset retirement obligation for its Mexican operations following a detailed review of the closing activities required. The adjustment led to a million decrease in the asset retirement obligation.

The Company believes that it is in material compliance with applicable Peruvian environmental laws and regulations.

The group can seek restitution or monetary compensation for the alleged injuries or suspension of the activities which allegedly caused the injuries in question. The amendments to the CFPC may result in more litigation, with plaintiffs seeking remedies, including suspension of the activities alleged to cause harm. In 2013, the Environmental Liability Federal Law was enacted. The law establishes general guidelines for actions considered likely to cause environmental harm. If a possible determination regarding harm occurs, environmental clean-up and remedial actions sufficient to restore the environment to a pre-existing condition must be taken. If restoration is not possible, compensation measures should be provided. Criminal penalties and monetary fines can be imposed under this law.

In addition, an emission trading scheme (ETS) in Mexico is currently available to the Company which is only applicable to business units, the metallurgic and lime plants in Sonora, which both generate annual GHG emissions levels above the threshold of tCO2 per year contemplated by the scheme. These two units are required to report and verify their emissions once a year. Units that emit more than tonnes CO2 equivalent per year (all of our Mexican units) are required to report their emissions to the National Emissions Registry (RENE) annually and to verify the reported emissions every three years. Total expenses to ensure annual compliance with climate change regulations in Mexico are not material to the Company. The Company believes that all of its facilities in Peru and Mexico are in compliance with environmental, mining and other applicable laws and regulations. The Company also believes that continued compliance with environmental laws of Mexico and Peru will have no material adverse effects on the Company s business, properties, or operating results. On May 09, 2023, Mexican Congress approved several changes effective immediately to the Mining Law, National Waters Law, the General Law of Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection, and the General Law for the Prevention and Integral Management of Waste.

 constitutional lawsuits (juicios de amparo) were filed before Federal Courts against various authorities and against a subsidiary of the Company, arguing; (i) the alleged lack of a waste management program approved by SEMARNAT; (ii) the alleged lack of a remediation plan approved by SEMARNAT with regard to the August 2014 spill; (iii) the alleged lack of community approval regarding the environmental impact authorizations granted by SEMARNAT to subsidiary of the Company; and (iv) the alleged inactivity of the authorities with regard of the spill in August 2014. The plaintiffs of these lawsuits are: Francisca Garcia Enriquez, et al filed lawsuits, Francisco Ramon Miranda, et al and Jesus David Lopez Peralta et al. In the third quarter of 2016, additional constitutional lawsuits, claiming similar damages were filed by Mario Alberto Salcido et al; Maria Elena Heredia Bustamante et al; Martin Eligio Ortiz Gamez et al; and Maria de los Angeles Enriquez Bacame et al. In the third quarter of 2017, BVC was served with another constitutional lawsuit filed by Francisca Garc a Enriquez et al. In 2018, BVC was served with additional constitutional lawsuits that were filed against SEMARNAT by Norberto Bustamante et al. With regard to the constitutional lawsuit filed by Maria Elena Heredia Bustamante et al; in which it was claimed the lack of community approval regarding the authorization granted by SEMARNAT to build the new BVC tailings dam, on September 5, 2018, the Supreme Court of Justice issued a resolution establishing that such authorization was granted to BVC in compliance with the applicable legislation. However, SEMARNAT must carry out a public meeting to inform the community of the technical aspects required to build the dam, potential impacts and prevention measures. This public meeting will have no material effects to BVC s operations. SEMARNAT has carried out the consultation ordered by the Supreme Court. As a result, it has informed the corresponding Judge about its compliance with the resolution, in which BVC was required to implement additional measures of environmental impact prevention, such as: (i) the building of at least monitoring wells downstream from the curtain of the contingency dam in a period of six months; (ii) monitoring of the groundwater level and water quality every six months; (iii) carrying out rain collection work in order to restore water to the Sonora River basin, with six months granted to present the execution program; (iv) determine the location of wildlife conservation and protection areas and define the need to establish biological corridors; (v) obtain photographic or videographic evidence every six months; (vi) submitting to SEMARNAT before the closure and abandonment of the site, or earlier if necessary, the closure program that includes the cleaning and restoration of the soil including Mexican regulation NOM-141; (vii) include the measures in the Environmental Monitoring Program according to the environmental components impacted; and (viii) hiring an external environmental consultant to validate compliance with the current and new conditions imposed. The foregoing does not impact BVC s operations. Additionally, the lawsuits filed by Maria de los Angeles Enriquez Bacame and Norberto Bustamante have been dismissed and closed without prejudice to the Company. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining cases were pending resolution. It is currently not possible to determine the extent of the damages sought in these state and federal lawsuits but the Company believes that these lawsuits are without merit. Accordingly, the Company is vigorously defending against them. Nevertheless, the Company believes that none of the legal proceedings resulting from the spill, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Labor matters : Peruvian operations: of the Company's Peruvian employees were unionized as of September 30, 2024. Currently, there are separate unions, of which represents the majority of workers, as defined by current Peruvian labor legislation. Currently, the Company has bargaining agreements with the unions. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company began applying the terms of the agreement entered into with the unions pursuant to Law 31632, which stipulates new conditions for compensation of leaves granted during COVID-19. Within the current framework of labor regulations and the agreements with all unions, this compensation has been adapted to align with current working hours of the mining sector. These conditions were in effect until December 1, 2023. In June 2023, the Company held meetings with the unions to discuss different issues of collective interest. In these meetings, the unions expressed concerns regarding the current economic situation, including the rise in the cost of living in Peru, as well as issues related to the provision of services granted by the Company. In this regard, in the third quarter of 2023, the Company released a formal response to each union where it is confirmed that there are collective labor agreements in force with each union. These agreements have regulated all the benefits related to salaries and working

 of affiliated workers in the Company s productive units, held elections for 2023-2025. Another union, which represents of affiliated workers, is in the process of electing its new representatives. In the second quarter of 2024, meetings were held with of the Company's unions. At the meetings, the unions collectively emphasized their requests petition for a "Productivity Bonus" starting in 2024. Additionally, the unions requested that discussions regarding their collective labor agreements move forward. The Company is still evaluating this request. In the third quarter of 2024, meetings were held with several of the Company s unions to discuss early collective bargaining agreements. Union representatives raised key issues such as long-term agreements, salary increases, administrative loans, early profit sharing, and maintaining peaceful labor relations. While some unions have already submitted their demands, others are still engaging in discussions with the Company s leadership. Negotiations remain active, with further proposals expected. Additionally, a new union has formed in Toquepala. This union, which is recognized by the Ministry of Labor, has yet to initiate formal activities and no collective labor agreement is in place. The Company maintains permanent communication with union representatives to ensure labor harmony and proper management of labor relations. Southern Peru has collective bargaining agreements with each of the unions, the earliest expiration of these agreements is in 2024 and the latest, in 2027. These agreements regulate benefits related to remuneration and working conditions. An important development in labor relations with the Company s unions stems from a ruling by the Peruvian Supreme Court that was notified to the Company on October 23, 2023. After of litigation, the Court ruled in favor of the Company to settle a suit involving a worker payment in the amount of S/ (approximately that a lower court had ordered the Company to pay to one of the unions in 2011. The Company had been legally pursuing reimbursemnt of the total amount paid to the workers. The union has expressed its intention to comply with the court order and to reach an agreement to return the amount paid by the Company. Mexican operations : In recent years, the Mexican operations have experienced a positive improvement in their labor environment, as workers opted to change their affiliation from the Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores Mineros, Metalurgicos y Similares de la Republica Mexicana (the National Mining Union to other less politicized unions. The workers of the San Martin mine were on strike since July 2007. On February 28, 2018, the striking workers of the San Mart n mine of IMMSA held an election to vote on the union that would hold the collective bargaining agreement at the San Martin mine. The Federacion Nacional de Sindicatos Independientes (the National Federation of Independent Unions) won the vote by a majority. Nevertheless, the vote was challenged by the National Mining Union. On June 26, 2018, the Federal Mediation and Arbitration Board issued a ruling recognizing the election results. Due to the agreement between workers and the Company to end the protracted strike, on August 22, 2018, the Federal Mediation and Arbitration Board authorized the restart of operations of the San Martin mine. Such authorization was challenged by the National Mining Union. On April 4, 2019, the Federal Mediation and Arbitration Board recognized, once again, the election results from February 28, 2018, by which the National Federation of Independent Unions won by a majority. In the last quarter of 2019, a Federal Court issued a resolution that established that the Labor Court should analyze the list of workers with the right to vote in the union election. The Company and the National Federation of Independent Unions challenged such determination before the Supreme Court of Justice. Such challenges were dismissed by the Supreme Court. Consequently, on September 6, 2021, the Federal Mediation and Arbitration Board issued a new resolution determining that, based on the documents submitted by the National Federation of Independent Unions and given the status of the strike until 2018, it was not possible to create a registry of workers holding a right to vote. Therefore, in case of a strike, any collective bargaining proceedings shall remain suspended. On June 9, 2023, the Federal Mediation and Arbitration Board, in a ruling that veered from its previous stance, did not recognize the common representatives of the coalition workers and consequently ruled that the agreement which such representatives had made with the Company to lift the strike in 2018 lacked validity. Notwithstanding, on June 14, 2023 the Federal Mediation and Arbitration Board

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the condensed consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Southern Copper Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, SCC , the Company , our , and we ). This item should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this quarterly report. Additionally, the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Business : Our business is primarily the production and sale of copper. In the process of producing copper, a number of valuable metallurgical by-products are recovered, which we also produce and sell. Market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products. Our management, therefore, focuses on value creation through copper production, cost control, production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices. We are one of the world s largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales and our principal operations are in Peru and Mexico. We also have exploration programs in Chile, Argentina and Ecuador. In addition to copper, we produce significant amounts of other metals, either as a by-product of the copper process or through a number of dedicated mining facilities in Mexico. Outlook : Various key factors will affect our outcome. These include, but are not limited to, the following: Sales structure : In the third quarter of 2024, approximately 77.1 of our revenue came from the sale of copper; 10.1 from molybdenum; 5.2 from silver; 3.9 from zinc; and 3.7 from various other products, including gold, sulfuric acid, and other materials. Copper : In the third quarter of 2024, the LME copper price increased from an average of 3.79 per pound in the third quarter of 2023 to 4.17 (+10.0 ). Based on supply and demand dynamics, we are expecting a slight market surplus of about 100,000 tonnes of copper for 2024. At this point in time, we estimate that the copper supply will register growth of 2.7 and demand, 2.3 . Looking at demand, although we still see weak demand from China, we believe the recently announced economic measures will promote economic growth and fuel demand from the world s largest copper consumer. Furthermore, a resilient US economy and new demand from decarbonization technologies, coupled with needs driven by artificial intelligence, are expected to bolster support for long-term copper demand. Molybdenum : Accounted for 10.1 of our sales in the third quarter of 2024 and is currently our most important by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged 21.68 per pound in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 23.59 in the same period of 2023, reflecting a decrease of 8.1 . Molybdenum is mainly used in the production of special alloys for stainless steel that require significant hardness and corrosion and heat resistance. New uses for this metal are associated with lubricants, sulfur filtering of heavy oils and shale gas production. For the short term, we believe molybdenum prices will have good support due to a market deficit and higher demand coming from the aerospace and defense industries. Silver : Represented 5.2 of our sales in the third quarter of 2024. We believe that silver prices will be supported by its extensive industrial applications, particularly in electronics, solar energy, and electric vehicles. Although the 

 37 

Table of Contents 
 supply is expected to remain stable, growing demand from emerging technologies could lead to a tighter market. This increased demand is likely to sustain higher prices over the long term. Zinc : Average zinc prices increased 14.5 in the third quarter of 2024 versus the figure in 2023. We believe zinc has strong long-term fundamentals, driven by sustained industrial demand, particularly in the construction and automotive sectors. Although current supply levels are stable, a forecasted reduction in mine production and the closing of key refineries suggest that supply will tighten over time. As demand continues to grow, this imbalance is expected to put upward pressure on prices in the long run. Zinc represented 3.9 of our sales in the third quarter of 2024. Production: For 2024, we expect to produce 975,000 tonnes of copper, an increase of 7.0 over 2023 s final print. This growth will be fueled by recovery at our SX-EW facilities at Buenavista; higher production in Peru; and copper production at our new Buenavista zinc concentrator, which is operating at full capacity. We also expect to produce 28,200 tonnes of molybdenum, which represents an increase of 5.0 over our 2023 production level. In 2024, we expect to produce 20.8 million ounces of silver, an increase of 12.8 compared to 2023 production results. Additionally, we expect to produce 120,300 tonnes of zinc from our mines, which represents an increase of 84.0 compared to our 2023 production level. This growth will be driven by the Buenavista Zinc concentrator. We expect this facility to produce 54,800 tonnes of zinc in 2024. For 2025 and on, we expect to produce over 154,000 tonnes per year. Capital Investments : In the nine month period of 2024, we spent 792.0 million on capital investments; this represented 30.7 of net income and an increase of 5.2 compared to the amount registered for the same period in 2023. KEY MATTERS Below, we discuss several matters that we believe are important to understand the results of our operations and financial condition. These matters include, (i) our earnings, (ii) our production, (iii) our operating cash costs as a measure of our performance, (iv) metal prices, (v) business segments, (vi) the effect of inflation and other local currency issues, and (vii) our capital investment and exploration program. Earnings : The table below highlights key financial and operational data of our Company for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions, except copper price, percentages and per share amounts): 

Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Variance Change 2024 2023 Variance Change Copper price LME 4.17 3.79 0.38 10.0 4.14 3.90 0.24 6.2 Pounds of copper sold 535.9 495.4 40.5 8.2 1,563.8 1,482.5 81.3 5.5 Net sales 2,930.9 2,505.6 425.3 17.0 8,649.0 7,600.2 1,048.8 13.8 Operating income 1,450.3 1,069.2 381.1 35.6 4,247.3 3,323.6 923.7 27.8 Net income attributable to SCC 896.7 619.5 277.2 44.7 2,582.9 1,980.2 602.7 30.4 Earnings per share 1.15 0.80 0.35 43.8 3.32 2.56 0.76 29.7 Dividends per share 0.60 1.00 (0.40) (40.0) 1.40 3.00 (1.60) (53.3) Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 totaled 2,930.9 million, which represented a substantial increase of 17.0 compared to net sales in the same period of 2023. This growth was primarily attributable to growth in the sales volumes of copper (+8.2 ), molybdenum (+5.6 ), silver (+17.4 ), and zinc (+50.1 ). Higher metal prices for copper (+10.0 , LME), silver (+24.7 ), and zinc (+14.5 further boosted sales. This positive performance was somewhat offset by a decline in molybdenum prices (-8.1 ).

Table of Contents 
 Net income attributable to SCC for the third quarter of 2024 reached 896.7 million, marking a 44.7 increase compared to the same period in 2023. This strong performance was primarily supported by a 17.0 rise in sales driven by improvements in pricing and higher sales volumes but slightly offset by a 3.1 increase in the cost of sales and a 33.2 rise in income taxes. Net sales for the nine-month period of 2024 increased 13.8 compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was driven by higher sales volumes of copper (+5.5 ), molybdenum (+11.6 ), silver (+13.7 ), and zinc (+39.3 ). Better results were also supported by higher prices for copper (+6.2 , LME) and silver (+16.0 ), which were nonetheless offset by a drop in prices for molybdenum (-17.4 ). Net income attributable to SCC for the nine-month period of 2024 increased by 30.4 compared to the same period in 2023. This performance was mainly driven by a 13.8 increase in sales, reflecting higher sales volumes and metal prices for most of our by-products. However, this growth was tempered by a slight rise in operating costs of 2.9 and a 30.6 increase in income taxes. Production : The table below highlights our mine production data for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Variance Change 2024 2023 Variance Change Copper (in million pounds) 556.1 498.5 57.6 11.5 1,620.2 1,492.4 127.8 8.6 Molybdenum (in million pounds) 16.0 15.1 0.9 6.0 48.5 43.3 5.2 11.9 Silver (in million ounces) 5.3 4.4 0.9 21.5 15.3 13.6 1.7 12.5 Zinc (in million pounds) 68.5 35.9 32.6 90.9 191.5 107.1 84.4 78.8 The table below highlights our mine production data for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Copper (in million pounds): 2024 2023 Variance Change 2024 2023 Variance Change Toquepala 143.4 123.3 20.1 16.3 423.7 353.8 69.9 19.8 Cuajone 90.2 74.7 15.5 20.8 271.0 238.5 32.5 13.7 La Caridad 64.4 61.3 3.1 5.1 193.9 179.1 14.8 8.3 Buenavista 253.0 233.6 19.4 8.3 715.8 705.4 10.4 1.5 IMMSA 5.1 5.6 (0.5) (8.4) 15.8 15.6 0.2 1.5 Total mined copper 556.1 498.5 57.6 11.5 1,620.2 1,492.4 127.8 8.6 Third quarter: Copper mine production in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 11.6 , reaching 556.1 million pounds. This growth was primarily driven by higher production levels at Cuajone (+20.8 ; due to higher ore grades and milling), Toquepala (+16.3 ; due to higher ore grades), Buenavista (+8.3 ; due to higher ore grades and recoveries), and La Caridad (+5.1 ; due to higher ore grades) operations. Growth was slightly offset by reduced production at the IMMSA (-8.4 ; due to lower ore grades) unit. Molybdenum production increased by 6.0 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was mainly due to higher production at our Toquepala (+51.2 ), Cuajone (+47.7 ), and Buenavista (+15.0 mines, which was primarily driven by an increase in ore grades. This performance was somewhat offset by a reduction in production at our La Caridad (-29.9 mine, which was attributable to a decrease in ore grades. Silver mine production increased by 21.5 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was attributable to higher production at our Buenavista (+45.6 ), Cuajone (+32.2 ), Toquepala (+31.4 ), and IMMSA (+5.6 operations. This performance was slightly offset by a decrease in production at our La Caridad (-1.5 mine.

 Zinc production increased by 90.9 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This significant growth was primarily attributed to the production start-up at the Buenavista zinc concentrator, which produced 14,453 tonnes during the period. Nine months : Mined copper production in the nine-month period of 2024 increased by 8.6 . This growth was mainly attributable to higher production at our Peruvian operations, where Toquepala was up 19.8 and Cuajone, 13.7 , both on the back of an improvement in ore grades. Production at our Mexican operations also rose over the period, registering growth of 2.8 . Molybdenum production, in the nine-month period of 2024 increased 11.9 compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was primarily driven by growth in output at our Toquepala mine (+65.8 ), which reflected better ore grades and recoveries. Our Cuajone (+17.0 and Buenavista (+10.6 mines also performed well during this timeframe. Growth in production was, nonetheless, somewhat attenuated by a decline in production at the La Caridad mine, which was down 15.4 . Silver mine production increased by 12.5 in the nine-month period of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This was largely attributable to higher output across our operations, including Toquepala (+27.2 ), Buenavista (+20.6 ), Cuajone (+13.5 ), La Caridad (+9.0 ), and IMMSA (+1.6 operations. Zinc production increased 78.8 in the nine-month period of 2024. This growth was primarily driven by production start-up at the Buenavista zinc concentrator, which produced 37,801 tonnes during the period. Operating Cash Costs: An overall benchmark that we use, which is a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced. Operating cash cost is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies. This non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced to the cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion) as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading, Non-GAAP Information Reconciliation on page 58. We disclose operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, both before and net of by-product revenues. We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced before by-product revenues as cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and depletion), plus selling, general and administrative charges, treatment and refining charges net of sales premiums; less the cost of purchased concentrates, workers participation and other miscellaneous charges, including royalty charges, and the change in inventory levels; divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, we exclude depreciation, amortization and depletion, which are considered non-cash expenses. Exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded. Workers participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre-tax earnings and are also excluded. Additional exclusions from operating cash costs are items of a non-recurring nature and the mining royalty charge as it is based on various calculations of taxable income, depending on which jurisdiction, Peru or Mexico, is imposing the charge. We believe these adjustments allow our management and stakeholders to more fully visualize our controllable cash cost, which we believe is one of the lowest of all copper-producing companies of similar size. We define operating cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by-product revenues as operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, as defined in the previous paragraph, less by-product revenues and net revenue (loss) on sale of metal purchased from third parties. In our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product revenues, we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of all our by-products, including, molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold, etc. and the net revenue (loss) on sale of metals purchased from third parties. We disclose this measure including the by-product revenues in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper. As part of our copper production process, much of our by-products are recovered. These by-products, as well as the processing of 

 40 

Table of Contents 
 copper purchased from third parties, are a supplemental part of our production process and their sales value contribute to covering part of our incurred fixed costs. We believe that our Company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company, and is valued, in large part, by the investment community s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost. We believe that both of these measures are useful tools for our management and our stakeholders. Our cash costs before by-product revenues allow us to monitor our cost structure and address areas of concern within operating management. The measure operating cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by-product revenues is a common measure used in the copper industry and is a useful management tool that allows us to track our performance and better allocate our resources. This measure is also used in our investment project evaluation process to determine a project s potential contribution to our operations, its competitiveness and its relative strength in different price scenarios. The expected contribution of by-products is generally a significant factor used by the copper industry to determine whether to move forward or not in the development of a new mining project. As the price of our by-product commodities can have significant fluctuations from period to period, the value of its contribution to our costs can be volatile. Our operating cash cost per pound of copper produced, before and net of by-product revenues, is presented in the table below for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Operating cash cost per pound of copper produced (1) (In millions, except cost per pound and percentages) 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Variance Change 2024 2023 Variance Change Total operating cash cost before by product revenues 1,046.2 1,073.0 (26.8) (2.5) 3,230.6 3,120.3 110.3 3.5 Total by product revenues (639.3) (604.3) (35.0) 5.8 (1,887.9) (1,752.3) (135.6) 7.7 Total operating cash cost net of by product revenues 406.9 468.7 (61.8) (13.2) 1,342.7 1,368.0 (25.3) (1.8) Total pounds of copper produced(2) 535.2 478.3 56.9 11.9 1,559.2 1,435.7 123.5 8.6 Operating cash cost per pound before by product revenues 1.95 2.24 (0.29) (13.0) 2.07 2.17 (0.10) (4.7) By products per pound revenues (1.19) (1.26) 0.07 (5.5) (1.21) (1.22) 0.01 (0.8) Operating cash cost per pound net of by product revenues 0.76 0.98 (0.22) (22.6) 0.86 0.95 (0.09) (9.7) 

 (1) These are non-GAAP measures. Please see page 57 for reconciliation to GAAP measure. (2) Net of metallurgical losses. In the third quarter of 2024, the operating cash cost per pound before by-product revenues dropped from 2.24 to 1.95, reflecting a 13.0 improvement in production efficiency. By-product revenues per pound also saw a slight decrease, going from 1.26 to 1.19. This contributed to a notable reduction in the operating cash cost per pound net of by-product revenues, which dropped from 0.98 to 0.76, a 22.6 decline. This decrease reflects positive cost management measures and higher production volumes, which offset the effect of lower by-product revenues. For the nine-month period of 2024, the operating cash cost per pound before by-product revenues fell from 2.17 to 2.07, representing a 4.7 improvement. Total operating cash costs, however, increased 3.5 to 3,230.6 million, while by-product revenues per pound remained relatively steady, falling marginally from 1.22 to 1.21. As a result, the operating cash cost per pound net of by-product revenues decreased 9.7 , going from 0.95 to 0.86. Copper production increased by 8.6 to 1,559.2 million pounds during this period, which reflects ongoing improvements in operating efficiency and cost controls.

 Metal Prices : The profitability of our operations is dependent on, and our financial performance is significantly affected by, the international market prices for the products we produce, and for copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver in particular. We are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metal prices. For the remaining three months of 2024, assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved, tax rates remain unchanged and no effects are generated by potential hedging programs, metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the following change in estimated net income attributable to SCC resulting from metal price changes: 

Copper Molybdenum Zinc Silver Change in metal prices (per pound except silver per ounce) 0.10 1.00 0.10 1.00 Change in net earnings (in millions) 31.6 8.2 6.0 3.1 Business Segments : We view our Company as having three reportable segments and manage it on the basis of these segments. These segments are (1) our Peruvian operations, (2) our Mexican open-pit operations and (3) our Mexican underground operations, known as our IMMSA unit. Our Peruvian operations include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, industrial railroad and port facilities that service both mines. The Peruvian operations produce copper, with significant by-product production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our Mexican open-pit operations include La Caridad and Buenavista mine complexes, the smelting and refining plants and support facilities, which service both mines. The Mexican open pit operations produce copper, with significant by-product production of molybdenum, silver and other material. Our IMMSA unit includes five underground mines that produce zinc, lead, copper, silver and gold, and several industrial processing facilities for zinc, copper and silver. Segment information is included in our review of Results of Operations in this item and also in Note 13 Segment and Related Information of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Inflation and Exchange Rate Effect of the Peruvian Sol and the Mexican Peso: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Significant portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian sol and Mexican pesos. Accordingly, when inflation and currency devaluation/appreciation of the Peruvian currency and Mexican currency occur, our operating results can be affected. In recent years, exchange rate volatility has been high but has had a limited effect on our results. Please see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more detailed information. Capital Investment Programs : We made capital investments of 792.0 million in the nine-month period of 2024, compared to 753.2 million in the same period of 2023. In general, the capital investments and investment projects described below are intended to increase production, decrease costs or address social and environmental commitments. Set forth below are descriptions of some of our current expected capital investment programs. We expect to meet the cash requirements for these projects by utilizing cash on hand; internally generated funds and additional external financing. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy and market conditions. Projects in Peru : Quebrada Honda dam expansion Tacna : This project aims to enlarge the main and lateral dams in Quebrada Honda and includes the relocation and repowered of some facilities due to dam growth and implementation of other facilities for water recovery, among other factors. The drainage works and removal of Eolic material for the main and lateral dam, as well as complementary operational works are completed. We have also installed two cyclone nests for the main dam, which are currently operating. Additionally, purchases are pending for equipment for tailings hauling. We intend to build administrative facilities down the line. This project has a total budget of 165.0 million, of which we have invested 152.0 million as of September 30, 2024.

 Tia Maria - Arequipa : This greenfield project, located in Arequipa, Peru, will use state of the art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards with a capacity of 120,000 tonnes of SX- EW copper cathodes per year. The Company has consistently promoted the welfare of the population of the Islay province and the Arequipa region. As part of these efforts, we have implemented several successful social programs in education, healthcare and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. Our current social programs in Islay help reduce the costs of agricultural production by improving productivity with cutting-edge technology. Additionally, we are working to provide internet access to 4,600 school students. On top of this, we are committed to developing health facilities, high performance schools, research centers and roads in the Arequipa region via the work for taxes mechanism. Tia Maria will generate significant revenues for the Arequipa region from day one of its operations. At current copper prices, we expect to export 17.5 billion and contribute 3.4 billion in taxes and royalties during the first 20 years of operation. The Company is currently reviewing its historical capital budget for Tia Maria of 1.4 billion. We will update this budget by year-end. Project update: As of September 30, 2024, the Company had generated more than 422 jobs, 355 of which were filled with local applicants. To the fullest extent possible, we intend to fill the 9,000 jobs estimated to be required during Tia Maria s construction with workers from the Islay province. When we start operations in 2027, the project will generate 600 direct jobs and 4,800 indirect jobs. In the coming months, we expect to build roads and access points; train operators; update the topographic network; install and delimit properties along the living fence; install a temporary camp; and begin earthmoving activities. In 2025, we expect construction to begin. Potential projects: We have a number of other projects that we may develop in the future. We continuously evaluate new projects on the basis of our long-term corporate objectives, expected return on investment, environmental concerns, required investment and estimated production, among other considerations. All capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted to respond to changes in the economy and market conditions. El Arco - Baja California : This is a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula with ore reserves of over 1,230 million tonnes with an average ore grade of 0.40 and 141 million tonnes of leach material with an average ore grade of 0.27 . The project includes an open-pit mine with a combined concentrator and SX-EW operations. Annual production is expected to total 190,000 tonnes of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold. Project update: The Company has completed the environmental baseline study for the mine, concentrator and industrial facilities and will proceed to submit the Environmental Impact Statement (Manifestacion de Impacto Ambiental MIA to the Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources SEMARNAT to request the respective environmental impact permits. The Company is currently preparing studies for the port, power lines, townsites and auxiliary facilities. El Pilar - Sonora : This low-capital intensity copper greenfield project is strategically located in Sonora, Mexico, approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 317 million tonnes of ore with an average copper grade of 0.249 . We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open-pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tonnes of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is 310 million. Los Chancas - Apurimac : This greenfield project, located in Apurimac, Peru, is a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. Current estimates of indicated copper mineral resources are 98 million tonnes of oxides with a copper content of 0.45 and 52 million tonnes of sulfides with a copper content of 0.59 . The Los Chancas project envisions an open-pit 

 43 

Table of Contents 
 mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes that are expected to produce 130,000 tonnes of copper and 7,500 tonnes of molybdenum annually. The estimated capital investment is 2,600 million and the project is expected to begin operating in 2031. We continue to engage in social and environmental improvements for the local communities and are working on the project s environmental impact assessment. Project update: The Company continues to engage in coordinated efforts with the Peruvian authorities to eradicate illegal mining activities. Once this process has concluded, we will resume the environmental impact assessment and begin hydrogeological and geotechnical studies. We will also begin a 40,000 meters in-fill drilling campaign to gather additional information on the geological characteristics of the Los Chancas deposit Michiquillay Project - Cajamarca : In June 2018, Southern Copper signed a contract for the acquisition of the Michiquillay project in Cajamarca, Peru. Michiquillay is a world class mining project with inferred mineral resources of 2,288 million tonnes and an estimated copper grade of 0.43 . When developed, we expect Michiquillay to produce 225,000 tonnes of copper per year (along with by-products of molybdenum, gold and silver) at a competitive cash-cost for an initial mine life of more than 25 years. We estimate an investment of approximately 2.5 billion will be required and expect production start-up by 2032. Michiquillay will become one of Peru s largest copper mines and will create significant business opportunities in the Cajamarca region; generate new jobs for the local communities; and contribute with taxes and royalties to the local, regional and national governments. Project update: As of September 30, 2024, the total progress of the exploration project was 30 . By this date, we have drilled 120,923 meters and obtained 39,234 drill core samples for chemical analysis. Diamond drilling will continue and will provide information for the interpretation of geological sections related to mineralization, geological modeling and mineral resource evaluation. Geo-metallurgical studies are currently underway; hydrological and hydrogeological studies for the project will begin shortly. The Company continues to work with the Michiquillay and La Enca ada communities based on the guidelines of corresponding social agreements. The aforementioned information is based solely on estimates. We cannot make any assurances that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE ESG PRACTICES Responsible Production. Our three operations in Peru, Cuajone, Toquepala and Ilo, were awarded with The Copper Mark and The Molybdenum Mark certifications for responsible production following an independent third-party assessment of environmental, social and governance performance (ESG). We are proud to report that all our open pit copper and molybdenum production has been certified under these standards. Education infrastructure for Arequipa. We delivered the Center for Research with specialized engineering laboratories to the Universidad Nacional de San Agust n de Arequipa (UNSA), Peru. This facility, which was built under the Works for Taxes mechanism at a cost of 18 million, is equipped with 24 laboratories and will benefit 6,500 students and 174 researchers. Recognition for the architectural and social value of the Cultural Center in Charcas. The Cultural Center, located in Charcas, San Luis Potosi, Mexico, obtained first place in the Noldi Schreck awards (350 entries) in the categories private institutional architecture and repurposing of buildings. This space, which began operations in the summer of 2023, has hosted over 4,700 participants and 120 volunteers across 200 activities related to education, culture, health, and sports. The Cultural Center, which is open to the public, is now considered a cultural attraction and receives visits from tourists, locals and state authorities. Dr. Vag n has provided more than 80 thousand medical services over the last 10 years. In September 2024, Dr. Vag n, which is Fundaci n Grupo M xico s health program, visited Cananea to provide more than 6,000 free medical

During these interventions,102 elderly residents received cataract surgery to help them recover their sight. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make our best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: ore reserves, revenue recognition, ore stockpiles on leach pads and related amortization, estimated impairment of assets, asset retirement obligations, determination of discount rates related to the financial lease liabilities, classification of operating leases versus financial leases, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, unrecognized tax benefits and fair value of financial instruments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. NEW ACCOUNTING DISCLOSURE RULES The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission released its final climate disclosure rule in March 2024. It requires that, when material, annual reports and registration statements include disclosures about greenhouse gas emissions under Scope 1 and Scope 2 as well as other climate-related subjects. The requirements for disclosure will begin phasing in for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. As we examine the new rule's impacts, we anticipate updating the climate-related disclosures in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year of adoption when defined.

(11.8) Plus: Increase in depreciation, amortization and depletion expense. 5.1 Increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. 1.2 Increase in exploration expenses. 1.0 Operating cost and expenses for the nine months of 2024 435.6 Intersegment Eliminations and Adjustments: The net sales, operating costs and expenses and operating income discussed above will not be directly equal to amounts in our condensed consolidated statement of earnings because the adjustments of intersegment operating revenues and expenses must be taken into account.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Commodity price risk: For additional information on metal price sensitivity, refer to Metal Prices in Part I, Item 2 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024. Foreign currency exchange rate risk: Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian soles and Mexican pesos. Given that our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, when inflation or deflation in our Mexican or Peruvian operations is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the sol or the peso to the dollar, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be affected by local cost conversion when expressed in U.S. dollars. In addition, the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in soles or pesos can be affected by an exchange rate variance of the sol or the peso, resulting in a re-measurement gain or loss in our financial statements. Recent inflation and exchange rate variances are provided in the table below for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Peru: Peruvian inflation rate 0.3 0.8 1.9 3.3 Initial exchange rate 3.837 3.633 3.713 3.820 Closing exchange rate 3.714 3.797 3.714 3.797 Appreciation/(devaluation) 3.2 (4.5) (0.0) 0.6 Mexico: Mexican inflation rate 1.1 1.5 2.8 2.9 Initial exchange rate 18.377 17.072 16.894 19.362 Closing exchange rate 19.629 17.620 19.629 17.620 Appreciation/(devaluation) (6.8) (3.2) (16.2) 9.0 Change in monetary position: Assuming an exchange rate variance of 10 at September 30, 2024, we estimate our net monetary position in Peruvian sol and Mexican peso would increase (decrease) our net earnings as follows: 

Effect in net earnings in millions) Appreciation of 10 in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol 33.6 Devaluation of 10 in U.S. dollar vs. Peruvian sol (41.0) Appreciation of 10 in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso (13.7) Devaluation of 10 in U.S. dollar vs. Mexican peso 11.2 Open sales risk: Our provisional copper and molybdenum sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separate from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of copper and molybdenum concentrates at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to settlement. See Note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information about these provisional sales.

 Short-term Investments: For additional information on our trading securities and available-for-sale investments, refer to Short-term Investments in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024. Derivative Instruments: From time to time, we use derivative instruments to manage our cash flows exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not enter into derivative contracts unless we anticipate that the possibility exists that future activity will expose our future cash flows to deterioration. Derivative contracts for commodities are entered into to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of the commodities that we use in our manufacturing process. Cash Flow Hedges of Natural Gas Our objective in using natural gas derivatives is to protect the stability of natural gas costs and manage exposure to natural gas price increases. To protect natural gas costs from estimated price increases in 2021, we acquired two derivative instruments that began in November 2021 and ended in March 2022. We assessed these derivative instruments as Cash Flow Hedges. As such, the effective portions of said hedges were initially reported in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) and were reclassified as earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. The Company did not identify any ineffective portions of these derivatives. As of September 30, 2024, we held no derivative instruments. Cautionary Statement : Forward-looking statements in this report and in other Company statements include statements regarding expected commencement dates of mining or metal production operations, projected quantities of future metal production, anticipated production rates, operating efficiencies, costs and expenditures as well as projected demand or supply for the Company s products. Actual results could differ materially depending upon factors including the risks and uncertainties relating to general U.S. and international economic and political conditions, the cyclical and volatile prices of copper, other commodities and supplies, including fuel and electricity, availability of materials, insurance coverage, equipment, required permits or approvals and financing, the occurrence of unusual weather or operating conditions, lower than expected ore grades, water and geological problems, the failure of equipment or processes to operate in accordance with specifications, failure to obtain financial assurance to meet closure and remediation obligations, labor relations, litigation and environmental risks as well as political and economic risk associated with foreign operations. Results of operations are directly affected by metal prices on commodity exchanges that can be volatile.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Southern Copper Corporation: Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Southern Copper Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the interim financial information ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 29, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Galaz, Yamazaki, Ruiz Urquiza, S.C. Member of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited
