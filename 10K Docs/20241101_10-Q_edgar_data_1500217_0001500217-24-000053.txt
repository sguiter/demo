 EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 of American Assets Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and American Assets Trust, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership, of which American Assets Trust, Inc. is the parent company and sole general partner. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to we, us, our or the company refer to American Assets Trust, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including American Assets Trust, L.P. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to our Operating Partnership or the Operating Partnership refer to American Assets Trust, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 American Assets Trust, Inc. operates as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of September 30, 2024, American Assets Trust, Inc. owned an approximate 78.8 partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining approximately 21.2 partnership interests are owned by non-affiliated investors and certain of our directors and executive officers. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, American Assets Trust, Inc. has full, exclusive and complete authority and control over the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management and business, can cause it to enter into certain major transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions and debt refinancings, and can cause changes in its line of business, capital structure and distribution policies. 
 
 American Assets Trust, Inc. believes that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership into a single report will result in the following benefits: 
 
 better reflects how management and the analyst community view the business as a single operating unit; 
 enhance investors' understanding of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole and in the same manner as management; 
 greater efficiency for American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership and resulting savings in time, effort and expense; and 
 greater efficiency for investors by reducing duplicative disclosure by providing a single document for their review. 
 
 The management of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership is the same and operates American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise. 
 
 There are certain differences between American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership, which are reflected in the disclosures in this report. We believe it is important to understand the differences between American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership in the context of how American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership operate as an interrelated consolidated company. American Assets Trust, Inc. is a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. As a result, American Assets Trust, Inc. does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership. American Assets Trust, Inc. itself does not hold any indebtedness. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all the assets of the company, directly or indirectly holds the ownership interests in the company's real estate ventures, conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly-traded equity. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by American Assets Trust, Inc., which are generally contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by American Assets Trust, Inc.'s business through the Operating Partnership s operations, by the Operating Partnership s direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of operating partnership units. 
 
 Noncontrolling interests and stockholders equity and partners capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of American Assets Trust, Inc. and those of American Assets Trust, L.P. The partnership interests in the Operating Partnership that are not owned by American Assets Trust, Inc. are accounted for as partners capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in American Assets Trust, Inc. s financial statements. To help investors understand the significant differences between American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership, this report presents the following separate sections for each of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership: 
 
 consolidated financial statements; 
 the following notes to the consolidated financial statements: 
 Debt; 
 Equity/Partners' Capital; and 
 Earnings Per Share/Unit; and

 This report also includes separate Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for each of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of American Assets Trust, Inc. have made the requisite certifications and American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and 18 U.S.C. 1350.

 Prior to the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Operating Partnership entered into a treasury lock contract on September 9, 2024 for million and September 10, 2024 for an additional million, which were both settled on September 10, 2024 at a combined loss of approximately million. As a result of the loss on these treasury lock contracts and the debt discount, the effective rate on our Senior Notes is per annum. The treasury lock contracts have been deemed to be highly effective cash flow hedges and have been designated as accounting hedges. Any gains or losses incurred upon the settlement of these treasury lock contracts are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and are amortized to interest expense over the life of the Senior Notes. 
 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be subsequently reclassified into earnings during the period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings for as long as hedged cash flows remain probable. During the next twelve months, we estimate the cash flow hedges in place will reduce interest expense by approximately million.

 common units (the noncontrolling common units ), and represented approximately of the ownership interests in our Operating Partnership at September 30, 2024. Common units and shares of our common stock have essentially the same economic characteristics in that common units and shares of our common stock share equally in the total net income or loss distributions of our Operating Partnership. Investors who own common units have the right to cause our Operating Partnership to redeem any or all of their common units for cash equal to the then-current market value of one share of our common stock, or, at our election, shares of our common stock on a -for-one basis. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, common units were converted into shares of our common stock. 
 Earnings Per Unit of the Operating Partnership 
 Basic earnings per unit EPU of the Operating Partnership is computed by dividing income applicable to unitholders by the weighted average Operating Partnership units outstanding, as adjusted for the effect of participating securities. Operating Partnership units granted in equity-based payment transactions that have non-forfeitable dividend equivalent rights are considered participating securities prior to vesting. The impact of unvested Operating Partnership unit awards on EPU has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested Operating Partnership unit awards based on distributions and the unvested Operating Partnership units participation rights in undistributed earnings. 
 The calculation of diluted EPU for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 does not include the weighted average of and unvested outstanding Operating Partnership units, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 does not include the weighted average of and unvested outstanding Operating Partnership units, respectively, as these equity securities are either considered contingently issuable or the effect of including these equity securities was anti-dilutive to income from continuing operations and net income attributable to the unitholders.

The sales of shares of our common stock made through the ATM equity program, as amended, are made in "at-the-market" offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, shares of common stock were sold through the ATM equity program. 
 We intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM equity program to fund our development or redevelopment activities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our revolving line of credit or other debt financing obligations, fund potential acquisition opportunities and/or for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we had the capacity to issue up to million in shares of our common stock under our current ATM equity program. Actual future sales will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our capital needs. As of September 30, 2024, we have no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under the ATM equity program.

 Taxability of Dividends 
 Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of distributions to stockholders and holders of common units, may differ from income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal income tax purposes in the treatment of revenue recognition and compensation expense and in the basis of depreciable assets and estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation. 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 We follow the FASB guidance related to stock-based compensation which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans, including all arrangements by which employees receive shares of stock or other equity instruments of the employer. The guidance also defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock award or similar equity instrument. 
 Granted Vested ) Forfeited ) Nonvested at September 30, 2024 
 We recognize noncash compensation expense ratably over the vesting period, and accordingly, we recognized million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Unrecognized compensation expense was million at September 30, 2024. 
 Earnings Per Share 
 We have calculated earnings per share EPS under the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation methodology whereby EPS for each class of common stock and participating security is calculated according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The weighted average unvested shares outstanding, which are considered participating securities, were and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Therefore, we have allocated our earnings for basic and diluted EPS between common shares and unvested shares as these unvested shares have nonforfeitable dividend equivalent rights. 
 Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the net income applicable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common and dilutive instruments outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, diluted shares exclude incentive restricted stock as these awards are considered contingently issuable. Additionally, the unvested restricted stock awards subject to time vesting are anti-dilutive for all periods presented, and accordingly, have been excluded from the weighted average common shares used to compute diluted EPS.

Leases on apartments generally range from to , with a majority having -month lease terms. Rooms at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property are rented on a nightly basis. 
 Leases at our office and retail properties and the retail portion of our mixed-use property may contain lease extension options, at our lessee's discretion.

The extension options are generally exercisable to months prior to the expiration of the lease and require the lessee to not be in default of the lease terms. 
 We attempt to maximize the amount we expect to derive from the underlying real estate property following the end of a lease, to the extent it is not extended. We maintain a proactive leasing and capital improvement program that, combined with the quality and locations of our properties, has made our properties attractive to tenants. However, the residual value of a real estate property is still subject to various market-specific, asset-specific, and tenant-specific risks and characteristics.

The extension option is included in the calculation of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as we are reasonably certain of exercising the extension option. 
 Our lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement in determining the present value of lease payments.

 business segments: the acquisition, redevelopment, ownership and management of office real estate, retail real estate, multifamily real estate and mixed-use real estate. The products for our office segment primarily include rental of office space and other tenant services, including tenant reimbursements, parking and storage space rental. The products for our retail segment primarily include rental of retail space and other tenant services, including tenant reimbursements, parking and storage space rental. The products for our multifamily segment include rental of apartments and other tenant services. The products of our mixed-use segment include rental of retail space and other tenant services, including tenant reimbursements, parking and storage space rental and operation of a -room all-suite hotel. 
 We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit, which is defined as property revenue less property expenses. We do not use asset information as a measure to assess performance and make decisions to allocate resources. Therefore, depreciation and amortization expense is not allocated among segments. General and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other income and expense are not included in segment profit as our internal reporting addresses these items on a corporate level. 
 Segment profit is not a measure of operating income or cash flows from operating activities as measured by GAAP, and it is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Not all companies calculate segment profit in the same manner. We consider segment profit to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it assists both investors and management in understanding the core operations of our properties.

 Overview 
 References to we, our, us and our company refer to American Assets Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, including American Assets Trust, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership, of which we are the sole general partner and which we refer to in this report as our Operating Partnership. 
 We are a full service, vertically integrated and self-administered REIT that owns, operates, acquires and develops high quality retail, office, multifamily and mixed-use properties in attractive, high-barrier-to-entry markets in Southern California, Northern California, Washington, Oregon, Texas and Hawaii. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio was comprised of twelve retail shopping centers; twelve office properties; a mixed-use property consisting of a 369-room all-suite hotel and a retail shopping center; and six multifamily properties. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we owned land at three of our properties that we classified as held for development and/or construction in progress. Our core markets include San Diego, California; the San Francisco Bay Area, California; Bellevue, Washington; Portland, Oregon and Oahu, Hawaii. We are a Maryland corporation formed on July 16, 2010 to acquire the entities owning various controlling and noncontrolling interests in real estate assets owned and/or managed by Ernest S. Rady or his affiliates, including the Ernest Rady Trust U/D/T March 13, 1983, or the Rady Trust, and did not have any operating activity until the consummation of our initial public offering on January 19, 2011. Our Company, as the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, has control of our Operating Partnership and owned 78.8 of our Operating Partnership as of September 30, 2024. Accordingly, we consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of our Operating Partnership. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 We identified certain critical accounting policies that affect certain of our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We have not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this report, other than those described in Footnote 1. 

Same-store 
 
 We have provided certain information on a total portfolio, same-store and redevelopment same-store basis. Information provided on a same-store basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared, properties under development, properties classified as held for development and properties classified as discontinued operations. Information provided on a redevelopment same-store basis includes the results of properties undergoing significant redevelopment for the entirety or portion of both periods being compared. Same-store and redevelopment same-store are considered by management to be important measures because they assist in eliminating disparities due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provide a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the company's stabilized and redevelopment properties, as applicable. Additionally, redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in evaluating the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment opportunities and the impact that these redevelopments have in enhancing our operating performance. 
 While there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, we typically reclassify significant development, redevelopment or expansion properties into same-store properties once they are stabilized. Properties are deemed stabilized typically at the earlier of (i) reaching 90 occupancy or (ii) four quarters following a property's inclusion in operating real estate. We typically remove properties from same-store properties when the development, redevelopment or expansion has or is expected to have a significant impact on the property's annualized base rent, occupancy and operating income within the calendar year. Our evaluation of significant impact related to development, redevelopment or expansion activity is based on quantitative and qualitative measures including, but not limited to, the following: the total budgeted cost of planned construction activity compared to the property s annualized base rent, occupancy and property operating income within the calendar year; percentage of development, redevelopment or expansion square footage to total property square footage; and the ability to maintain historic occupancy and rental rates. In consideration of these measures, we generally remove properties from same-store properties when we see a decline in a property's annualized base rent, occupancy and operating income within the 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 calendar year as a direct result of ongoing redevelopment, development or expansion activity. Acquired properties are classified into same-store properties once we have owned such properties for the entirety of comparable period(s) and the properties are not under significant development or expansion. 
 
 Below is a summary of our same-store and redevelopment same-store composition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Bel-Spring 520 is classified as a same-store property when compared to the designation for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, because the property was acquired on March 8, 2022. The 710 building within the Lloyd Portfolio is classified as same-store property when compared to the designation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, because the property has been in operation for a full year since it was placed in service in November of 2022. One Beach Street continues to be identified as a same-store redevelopment property due to significant redevelopment activity. Additionally, this property was placed into operations on August 1, 2024, approximately one year after completing renovations. 
 
 Retail same-store net operating income increased approximately 2.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Office same-store net operating income increased 8.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

Outlook 
 
 We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following: growth in our same-store portfolio, growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments and expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions. Our properties are located in some of the nation's most dynamic, high-barrier-to-entry markets primarily in Southern California, Northern California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii, which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration and/or retenanting. We evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities. 
 
 We intend to opportunistically pursue projects in our development pipeline, including future phases of La Jolla Commons, Lloyd Portfolio and development of multifamily units at Lomas Santa Fe Plaza, as well as other redevelopments at Waikele Center and One Beach Street. The commencement of these developments is based on, among other things, market conditions and our evaluation of whether such opportunities would generate appropriate risk-adjusted financial returns. Our redevelopment and development opportunities are subject to various factors, including market conditions and may not ultimately come to fruition. 
 
 We continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that would complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. Some of our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities. Any growth from acquisitions is contingent upon our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance a property acquisition. Generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash, mortgage loans and/or borrowings under our revolving line of credit, which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt.

 Leasing 
 
 Our same-store growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy. Over the long-term, we believe that the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide us with a strategic advantage, allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates. Furthermore, we believe the locations of our properties and diversified portfolio will mitigate some of the potentially negative impact of the current economic environment. However, in 2020 through 2022, due to COVID-19, we saw a meaningful negative impact on certain of our tenants' operations and ability to pay rent, primarily in the retail sector. Any reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we signed 14 office leases for a total of 105,746 square feet of office space including 57,935 square feet of comparable renewal office space leases (leases for which there was a prior tenant), at an average rental rate increase on a cash basis and increase on a GAAP basis of 7.8 and 16.4 , respectively. New office leases for comparable spaces were signed for 16,671 square feet at an average rental rate increase on a cash and GAAP basis of 18.3 and 15.7 , respectively. Renewals for comparable office spaces were signed for 41,264 square feet at an average rental rate increase on a cash basis and GAAP basis of 3.8 and 16.7 , respectively. Tenant improvements and incentives were 62.04 per square foot of office space for comparable new leases for the three months ended September 30, 2024, mainly due to new tenants at Torrey Reserve Campus and City Center Bellevue. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we signed 23 retail leases for a total of 133,499 square feet of retail space including 125,308 square feet of comparable renewal retail space leases (leases for which there was a prior tenant), at an average rental rate increase on a cash and GAAP basis of 4.4 and 18.7 , respectively. New retail leases for comparable spaces were signed for 505 square feet at an average rental rate decrease on a cash basis of 1.0 and increase on a GAAP basis of 5 . Renewals for comparable retail spaces were signed for 124,803 square feet at an average rental rate increase on a cash and GAAP basis of 4.5 and 18.8 , respectively. There were no tenant improvements or incentives on retail space for comparable new leases during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in arms-length transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period. The comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent to be paid on the new lease. In some instances, management exercises judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation. The change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates, location, individual tenant creditworthiness, use of space, market conditions when the expiring lease was signed, capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure. Tenant improvements and incentives include the total dollars committed for the improvement of a space as it relates to a specific lease, but may also include base-building costs (i.e. expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements. 
 
 The leases signed in 2024 generally become effective over the following year, though some may not become effective until 2025 and beyond. Further, there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating, financing or other matters. 
 
 Capitalized Costs 
 
 Certain external and internal costs directly related to the development and redevelopment of real estate, including pre-construction costs, real estate taxes, insurance, interest, construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved, are capitalized. We capitalize costs under development until construction is substantially complete and the property is held available for occupancy. The determination of when a development project is substantially complete and when capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. We consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of landlord-owned tenant improvements or when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for construction of its own improvements, but not later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with any remaining portion under construction. 
 
 We capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities combined of 4.6 million and 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 12.9 million and 19.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 We capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements combined of 15.0 million and 15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 39.1 million and 40.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively 
 Interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service. Capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use as noted above. We make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income. If the time period for capitalizing interest is extended, however, more interest is capitalized, thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period. We capitalized interest costs related to development activities of 1.7 million and 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 5.9 million and 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 For our discussion of results of operations, we have provided information on a total portfolio and same-store basis. 
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 The following summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to our consolidated results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, our operating portfolio was comprised of 31 retail, office, multifamily and mixed-use properties with an aggregate of approximately 7.2 million rentable square feet of retail and office space, including the retail portion of our mixed-use property, 2,110 residential units (including 120 RV spaces) and a 369-room hotel. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we owned land at three of our properties that we classified as held for development and/or construction in progress.

 Total office rental revenue decreased 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease of 1.2 million in rental revenue driven by lower occupancy and annualized base rents at Lloyd Portfolio, lower occupancy at Torrey Reserve Campus, and a decrease of 0.8 million in cost recoveries due to changes in tenant base years, a decrease in recoverable property expenses, and prior year tax refunds received that were passed back to tenants. 
 Total retail rental revenue increased 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to new tenant leases and scheduled rent increases at Solana Beach Towne Center, Carmel Country Plaza and Del Monte Center. Additionally, there was an increase of 0.4 million in cost recoveries. 
 Multifamily revenue increased 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an overall increase in average monthly base rent and an increase in occupancy. Average monthly base rent and occupancy was 2,733 and 90.1 , respectively for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,572 and 88.5 , respectively for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Total mixed-use rental revenue decreased 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in average occupancy of 83.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 89.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in rental revenue at the retail portion of our mixed-use property, primarily due to new tenant leases commencing at higher base rents. 
 Other property income . Other property income increased 11.6 million, or 203 to 17.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Total office property operating income increased 9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 11.0 million in lease termination fee received at Torrey Reserve Campus and lower real estate taxes due to tax refunds received at La Jolla Commons. These increases were offset by a decrease of 1.2 million in rental revenue driven primarily by lower occupancy and annualized base rents at Lloyd Portfolio, lower occupancy at Torrey Reserve Campus, a decrease in cost recoveries, and an increase in rental expenses related to utilities expenses, insurance expense and repairs and maintenance expense. 
 Total retail property operating income increased 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher rental revenue at Solana Beach Towne Center, Carmel Country Plaza and Del Monte Center due to new tenant leases, scheduled rent increases and an increase in cost recoveries.

 Other 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased 0.2 million, or 2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs, including, without limitation, with respect to base pay for certain salaried and hourly workers and benefits, offset by lower legal expenses and stock-based compensation expense, attributable to a decrease in the number of restricted stock awards granted as part of our 2023 grant. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 3.7 million, or 12 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was due to the acceleration of assets related to a tenant vacating their space early at Torrey Reserve Campus. Additionally, the increase was also due to new building improvement assets with One Beach Street placed into operations as of August 1, 2024 and new tenant improvement and leasing commission assets placed into service. 
 Interest Expense, net. Interest expense increased 1.9 million, or 12 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the closing of our 6.150 Senior Notes on September 17, 2024 and the 100 million draw on our Revolver Loan on July 18, 2024 which was subsequently repaid on September 19, 2024. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense related to the maturity and repayment of our Series F Notes on July 19, 2024. 
 Other Income, net. Other income, net increased 1.4 million, or 442 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

This increase was primarily due to the net settlement payment of approximately 10.0 million received during the three months ended March 31, 2024 relating to building specifications for one of the existing buildings at our office project in University Town Center (San Diego), compared to the net settlement payment of approximately 6.3 million received on January 3, 2023 related to certain building systems at our Hassalo on Eighth property and an increase in interest and investment income attributed to higher yield on our average cash balance during the period. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc. 
 
 In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc. section, the term the company refers only to American Assets Trust, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, and excludes the Operating Partnership and all other subsidiaries. 
 
 The company s business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership, of which the company is the parent company and sole general partner, and which it consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Because the company operates on a consolidated basis with the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P. should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the company on a consolidated basis and how the company is operated as a whole. 
 
 The company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership. The company itself does not have any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of the company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. However, all debt is held directly or indirectly by the Operating Partnership. The company s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock. The company s principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the company owned an approximate 78.8 partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining approximately 21.2 are owned by non-affiliated investors and certain of the company's directors and executive officers. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, American Assets Trust, Inc. has the full, exclusive and complete authority and control over the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management and business, can cause it to enter into certain major transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions and refinancings, and can cause changes in its line of business,

 capital structure and distribution policies. The company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as the company may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement. 
 
 The liquidity of the company is dependent on the Operating Partnership s ability to make sufficient distributions to the company. The primary cash requirement of the company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders. The company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership s debt, as discussed further in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements, which trigger the company s guarantee obligations, then the company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. However, the company s only significant asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership. 
 
 We believe the Operating Partnership s sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured line of credit, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the company and, in turn, for the company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders. As of September 30, 2024, the company has determined that it has adequate working capital to meet its dividend funding obligations for the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that the Operating Partnership s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the company. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership s ability to pay its distributions to the company, which would in turn, adversely affect the company s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders. 
 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for future dividends expected to be paid to the company s stockholders, operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties, interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, general and administrative expenses, funding construction projects, capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. 
 
 The company may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem the Operating Partnership s outstanding debt, the company s shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or redemptions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 
 For the company to maintain its qualification as a REIT, it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains. While historically the company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, the company s own stock. As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not REITs can. The company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership s working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. Although there is no intent at this time, if market conditions deteriorate, the company may also delay the timing of future development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions, reduce the Operating Partnership s operating expenditures, or re-evaluate its dividend policy. 
 
 The company is a well-known seasoned issuer. As circumstances warrant, the company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. When the company receives proceeds from preferred or common equity issuances, it is required by the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, to develop new or existing properties, to acquire properties or for general corporate purposes. 
 
 In December 2023, the company, together with the Operating Partnership, filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the SEC, which became effective upon filing and which replaced the prior Form S-3ASR that was filed with the SEC in January 2021. The universal shelf registration statement may permit the company from time to time to offer and sell equity securities of the company. However, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete any such offerings of securities. Factors influencing the availability of additional financing include investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets, among others. 
 
 On December 3, 2021, we entered into a new ATM equity program with five sales agents under which we may, from time to time, offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 250.0 million. The sale of shares of our common stock made through the ATM equity program are made in "at-the-market" offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Table of Contents 

 We intend to use the net proceeds to fund development or redevelopment activities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our amended and restated credit facility or other debt financing obligations, fund potential acquisition opportunities and/or for general corporate purposes. Actual future sales will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of the company's common stock and the company's capital needs. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, no shares of common stock were sold through the ATM equity program. We have no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under the ATM equity program. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P. 
 
 In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P. section, the terms we, our and us refer to the Operating Partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Operating Partnership and American Assets Trust, Inc. together with their consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. American Assets Trust, Inc. is our sole general partner and consolidates our results of operations for financial reporting purposes. Because we operate on a consolidated basis with American Assets Trust, Inc., the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc. should be read in conjunction with this section to understand our liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis. 
 Due to the nature of our business, we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations. The cash generated from operations is used for the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service and dividends to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders and our unitholders. As a REIT, American Assets Trust, Inc. must generally make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90 of its net taxable income. As of September 30, 2024, we held 533.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, regular debt service requirements, dividend payments to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders required to maintain its REIT status, distributions to our unitholders, capital expenditures and, potentially, acquisitions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations, reserves established from existing cash and, if necessary, borrowings available under our credit facility. 
 Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the repayment of debt at maturity, property acquisitions, tenant improvements and capital improvements. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements to pay scheduled debt maturities and to fund property acquisitions and capital improvements with net cash from operations, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and, if necessary, the issuance of equity and debt securities. We also may fund property acquisitions and capital improvements using our amended and restated credit facility pending permanent financing. We believe that we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity. However, we cannot be assured that this will be the case. Our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about our company. 
 Our overall capital requirements for the remainder of 2024 and for the nine months ending September 30, 2025 will depend upon acquisition opportunities and the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties. Our capital investments will be funded on a short-term basis with, among other sources of capital, cash on hand, cash flow from operations and/or our revolving line of credit. On a long-term basis, our capital investments may be funded with additional long-term debt, including, without limitation, mortgage debt and unsecured notes. Our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including, without limitation, our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. Our capital investments may also be funded by issuing additional equity including, without limitation, shares issued by American Assets Trust, Inc. under its ATM equity program or through an underwritten public offering. Although there is no intent at this time, if market conditions deteriorate or fail to improve, we may also delay the timing of future development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions, reduce our operating expenditures, or re-evaluate our dividend policy. 
 In December 2023, the Operating Partnership, together with American Assets Trust, Inc., filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the SEC, which became effective upon filing and which replaced the prior Form S-3ASR that was filed with the SEC in January 2021.

 Cash Flows 
 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were 533.0 million and 90.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 16.6 million to 166.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 149.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash from operations was primarily due to the net settlement received relating to the building specifications for one of the existing buildings at our office project in University Town Center (San Diego), increase in lease termination fees, rental revenue and changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased 13.5 million to 56.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 70.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to the decrease in capital expenditures at La Jolla Commons III and One Beach Street as these projects have completed construction. 
 Net cash provided in financing activities increased 379.7 million to 340.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash used in financing activities of 39.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided in financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds received from the issuance of the 6.15 Senior Notes, partially offset by the repayment of the then-outstanding 100 million on our Revolver Loan. The 100 million draw on our Revolver Loan was used to repay the entirety of our Series F Notes upon maturity on July 19, 2024. 
 
 Net Operating Income 
 Net Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. We define NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements, lease termination fees, ground lease rental income and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, ground lease expense, property marketing costs, real estate taxes and insurance). NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related expense, other non-property income and losses, gains and losses from property dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to the NOIs of other REITs. 
 NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by (1) the cost of funds of the property owner, (2) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (3) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The cost of funds is eliminated from net income because it is specific to the particular financing capabilities and constraints of the owner. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital, which may have changed or may change in the future. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our retail, office, multifamily or mixed-use properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is intended to be captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale, which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.

Table of Contents 

 However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income, which further limits its usefulness. 
 NOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the components of net income that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do. 
 The following is a reconciliation of our NOI to net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 computed in accordance with GAAP (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net operating income 80,405 69,887 220,555 208,428 General and administrative (9,068) (8,880) (26,647) (26,488) Depreciation and amortization

Funds from Operations 
 We calculate funds from operations FFO ), in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real-estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 
 FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real-estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to FFO, the nearest GAAP equivalent (in thousands, except per share and share data):

 (1) The weighted average common shares used to compute FFO per diluted share include unvested restricted stock awards that are subject to time vesting, which were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS, as the vesting of the restricted stock awards is dilutive in the computation of FFO per diluted share but is anti-dilutive for the computation of diluted EPS for the period. Diluted shares exclude incentive restricted stock as these awards are considered contingently issuable. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. We manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating, investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments, dividends to our stockholders and Operating Partnership unitholders, investments, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Outstanding Debt 
 The following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on the fair value of our total outstanding debt. Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt. Discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages payable. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. This analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt, such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change. This analysis assumes no change in our financial structure. 
 Fixed Interest Rate Debt 
 Our outstanding notes payable obligations (maturing at various times through October 2034) have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates. However, interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments. At September 30, 2024, we had 1.8 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding with an estimated fair value of 1.7 billion. If interest rates at September 30, 2024 had been 1.0 higher, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 68.6 million. If interest rates at September 30, 2024 had been 1.0 lower, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 93.4 million. The carrying values of our revolving line of credit and term loans are deemed to be at fair value since the outstanding debt is directly tied to monthly SOFR contracts. Additionally, we consider 325.0 million related to Term Loan A, Term Loan B and Term Loan C outstanding as of September 30, 2024 to be fixed rate debt as the rate is effectively fixed by interest rate swap agreements. 
 Variable Interest Rate Debt 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 325.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding, all of which is subject to interest rate swaps as described above. We have historically entered into forward starting interest rate swaps in order to economically hedge against the risk of rising interest rates that would affect our interest expense related to our future anticipated debt issuances as part of its overall borrowing program. See the discussion under Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for certain quantitative details related to the interest rate swaps and for a discussion on how we value derivative financial instruments. Based upon this amount of variable rate debt and the specific terms, if market interest rates increased or decreased by 1.0 , our annual interest expense would not change and have no corresponding change in our net income and cash flows for the year, since this variable rate debt is effectively fixed by interest rate swap agreements.
