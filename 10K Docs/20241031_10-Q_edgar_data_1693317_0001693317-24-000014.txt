 operational Trains for a total production capacity of approximately mtpa of LNG, LNG storage tanks and marine berths. Additionally, we are constructing an expansion of the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal (the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project consisting of midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of over mtpa of LNG. 
 
 Through our subsidiary CCP, we also own a -mile natural gas supply pipeline that interconnects the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal with several large interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines (the Corpus Christi Pipeline and together with the existing assets at the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal and the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project, the Liquefaction Project ). 
 
 We are pursuing an expansion project to provide additional liquefaction capacity, and we have commenced commercialization to support the additional liquefaction capacity associated with this potential expansion project. The development of this site or other projects, including infrastructure projects in support of natural gas supply and LNG demand, will require, among other things, acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before we make a positive FID. 
 
 We do not have employees and thus we have various services agreements with affiliates of Cheniere in the ordinary course of business, including services required to construct, operate and maintain the Liquefaction Project, and administrative services. See Note 9 Related Party Transactions for additional details of the activity under these services agreements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 We value the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives using a market or option-based approach incorporating present value techniques, as needed, which incorporates observable commodity price curves, when available, and other relevant data. 
 
 We include a significant portion of the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy as the fair value is developed through the use of internal models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants may use in valuing the asset or liability. To the extent valued using an option pricing model, we consider the future prices of energy units for unobservable periods to be a significant unobservable input to estimated net fair value. In estimating the future prices of energy units, we make judgments about market risk related to liquidity of commodity indices and volatility utilizing available market data. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments. We derive our volatility assumptions based on observed historical settled global LNG market pricing or accepted proxies for global LNG market pricing as well as settled domestic natural gas pricing. Such volatility assumptions also contemplate, as of the balance sheet date, observable forward curve data of such indices, as well as evolving available industry data and independent studies. 
 
 In developing our volatility assumptions, we acknowledge that the global LNG industry is inherently influenced by events such as unplanned supply constraints, geopolitical incidents, unusual climate events including drought and uncommonly mild, by historical standards, winters and summers, and real or threatened disruptive operational impacts to global energy infrastructure. Our current estimate of volatility includes the impact of otherwise rare events unless we believe market participants would exclude such events on account of their assertion that those events were specific to our company and deemed within our control. Our fair value estimates incorporate market participant-based assumptions pertaining to certain contractual uncertainties, including those related to the availability of market information for delivery points, as well as the timing of satisfaction of certain events or development of infrastructure to support natural gas gathering and transport. We may recognize changes in fair value through earnings that could significantly impact our results of operations if and when such uncertainties are resolved. 
 
 The Level 3 fair value measurements of our natural gas positions within the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives could be materially impacted by a significant change in certain natural gas and international LNG prices.

Liquefaction Supply Derivatives 
 
 We hold Liquefaction Supply Derivatives which are primarily indexed to the natural gas market and international LNG indices. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining fixed terms of the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives ranged up to approximately years, some of which commence or accelerate upon the satisfaction of certain events or development of infrastructure to support natural gas gathering and transport. 
 
 The forward notional amount for the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives was approximately TBtu and TBtu as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, inclusive of amounts under contracts with unsatisfied contractual conditions, and exclusive of extension options that were uncertain to be taken as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Fair Value and Location of Derivative Assets and Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets 
 
 All existing counterparty derivative contracts provide for the unconditional right of set-off in the event of default. We have elected to report derivative assets and liabilities arising from those derivative contracts with the same counterparty and the unconditional contractual right of set-off on a net basis. The use of derivative instruments exposes us to counterparty credit risk, or the risk that a counterparty will be unable to meet its commitments, in instances when the derivative instruments are in an asset position. Additionally, counterparties are at risk that we will be unable to meet its commitments in instances where our derivative instruments are in a liability position. We incorporate both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in fair value measurements depending on the position of the derivative. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, set-off rights and guarantees.

 Contributions from Cheniere for Extinguishment of Senior Secured Notes 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Cheniere fully retired billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2025 CCH Senior Notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Cheniere repurchased million of certain series of our Senior Secured Notes on the open market, which were subsequently cancelled by us. Additionally, Cheniere paid interest on our behalf that was due at the time of the respective debt repayments of million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, we recorded a non-cash charge through equity of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 associated with the debt extinguishments. 
 
 The aforementioned debt extinguishment activities by Cheniere on our behalf were in accordance with the Equity Contribution Agreements, as noted in Note 9 Related Party Transactions , and recorded as net contributions from Cheniere to us, for which we paid no consideration, within our Consolidated Statements of Member s Equity. 
 
 Restrictive Debt Covenants 
 
 The indentures governing our senior notes and other agreements underlying our debt contain customary terms and events of default and certain covenants that, among other things, may limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to make certain investments or pay dividends or distributions. We are restricted from making distributions under agreements governing our indebtedness generally until, among other requirements, appropriate reserves have been established for debt service using cash or letters of credit and a historical debt service coverage ratio and projected debt service coverage ratio of at least :1.00 is satisfied. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our debt agreements.

 Fair Value Disclosures 

(1) billion and billion, respectively, of the fair value of our senior notes were classified as Level 3 since these senior notes were valued by applying an unobservable illiquidity adjustment to the price derived from trades or indicative bids of instruments with similar terms, maturities and credit standing. The remainder of the fair value of our senior notes are classified as Level 2, based on prices derived from trades or indicative bids of the instruments. 
 
 The estimated fair value of our credit facilities approximates the principal amount outstanding because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates and the debt may be repaid, in full or in part, at any time without penalty.

 The following potential future sources of revenue are omitted from the table above under exemptions we have elected: (1) all performance obligations that are part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less and (2) substantially all variable consideration under our SPAs, as well as variable consideration that is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation when that performance obligation qualifies as a series. The amount of revenue from variable fees that is not included in the transaction price will vary based on the future prices of Henry Hub throughout the contract terms, to the extent customers elect to take delivery of their LNG, and adjustments to the consumer price index. Certain of our contracts contain additional variable consideration based on the outcome of contingent events and the movement of various indexes. We have not included such variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent the consideration is considered constrained due to the uncertainty of ultimate pricing and receipt. Additionally, we have excluded variable consideration related to volumes that are contractually subject to additional liquefaction capacity beyond what is currently in construction or operation.

Overview 
 
 We are a Delaware limited liability company formed by Cheniere. We provide clean, secure and affordable LNG to integrated energy companies, utilities and energy trading companies around the world. We aspire to conduct our business in a safe and responsible manner, delivering a reliable, competitive and integrated source of LNG to our customers. 
 
 LNG is natural gas (methane) in liquid form. The LNG we produce is shipped all over the world, converted back into natural gas (called regasification and then transported via pipeline to homes and businesses and used as an energy source that is essential for heating, cooking, other industrial uses and back up for intermittent energy sources. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning, abundant and affordable source of energy. When LNG is converted back to natural gas, it can be used instead of coal, which reduces the amount of pollution traditionally produced from burning fossil fuels, like sulfur dioxide and particulate matter that enters the air we breathe. Additionally, compared to coal, it produces significantly fewer carbon emissions. By liquefying natural gas, we are able to reduce its volume by 600 times so that we can load it onto special LNG carriers designed to keep the LNG cold and in liquid form for efficient transport overseas. 
 
 We own and operate a natural gas liquefaction and export facility located near Corpus Christi, Texas (the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal through CCL, which currently has natural gas liquefaction facilities consisting of three operational Trains for a total production capacity of approximately 15 mtpa of LNG, three LNG storage tanks with aggregate capacity of approximately 10 Bcfe and two marine berths that can each accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters. We are constructing an expansion of the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal (the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project consisting of seven midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of over 10 mtpa of LNG. We also own and operate through CCP a 21.5-mile natural gas supply pipeline that interconnects the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal with several large interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines (the Corpus Christi Pipeline and together with the existing assets at the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal and the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project, the Liquefaction Project ). 
 
 Our long-term customer arrangements form the foundation of our business and provide us with significant, stable, long-term cash flows. We have contracted most of our anticipated production capacity under SPAs, in which our customers are generally required to pay a fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes irrespective of their election to cancel or suspend deliveries of LNG cargoes, and under IPM agreements, in which a gas producer sells natural gas to us on a global LNG or natural gas index price, less a fixed liquefaction fee, shipping and other costs. The SPAs also have a variable fee component, which is generally structured to cover the cost of natural gas purchases, transportation and liquefaction fuel consumed to produce LNG. Since we procure most of our feedstock for LNG production from the U.S., the structure of these contracts helps limit our exposure to fluctuations in U.S. natural gas prices. Through our SPAs and IPM agreements, we have contracted 
 19 

Table of Contents 

approximately 90 of the total anticipated production from the Liquefaction Project with approximately 17 years of weighted average remaining life as of September 30, 2024, excluding volumes that are contractually subject to additional liquefaction capacity beyond what is currently in construction or operation. 
 
 We remain focused on safety, operational excellence and customer satisfaction. Increasing demand for LNG has allowed us to expand our liquefaction infrastructure in a financially disciplined manner. We have increased available liquefaction capacity at our Liquefaction Project as a result of debottlenecking and other optimization projects. We believe these factors provide a foundation for additional growth in our portfolio of customer contracts in the future. We hold a significant land position at the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal, which provides opportunity for further liquefaction capacity expansion. In March 2023, CCL and another subsidiary of Cheniere submitted an application to the FERC under the Natural Gas Act (the NGA for an expansion adjacent to the Liquefaction Project consisting of two midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of approximately 3 mtpa of LNG (the CCL Midscale Trains 8 9 Project ). The development of the Midscale Trains 8 9 Project or other projects, including infrastructure projects in support of natural gas supply and LNG demand, will require, among other things, acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before a positive FID is made. 
 
 Additionally, we are committed to the management of our most important ESG impacts, risks and opportunities. In August 2024, Cheniere published Energy Secured, Benefits Delivered , its fifth Corporate Responsibility CR report, which details Cheniere s approach and progress on ESG matters. Cheniere s CR report is available at cheniere.com/our-responsibility/reporting-center. Information on Cheniere s website, including the CR report, is not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Net income 
 
 Net income declined by 623 million and 4.5 billion between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily as a result of unfavorable changes in fair value of derivatives of 699 million and 4.5 billion, respectively, principally attributable to our IPM agreements, mainly due to the nonrecurrence of significant declines of historic volatility in international gas prices and moderated and sustained spot prices in the current period relative to the same period of 2023. The remaining changes in fair value of derivatives were primarily due to an unfavorable shift in long-term U.S. natural gas forward prices. 

21 

Table of Contents 

The following is an additional discussion of the significant drivers of the variance in net income by line item: 
 Revenues 
 
 We had 39 million and 565 million decreases in revenues between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, which was primarily attributable to 40 million and 420 million decreases, respectively, from lower pricing per MMBtu as a result of declining Henry Hub pricing. Between the comparable nine month periods, there was a further 147 million decrease from lower production volume, primarily attributable to increased maintenance activities resulting from temporary composition changes in the quality of feed gas received from third parties following a freeze event in the Permian Basin in January 2024. 
 Operating costs and expenses (recoveries) 
 
 The increase in operating costs and expenses of 629 million and 4.0 billion between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, was attributable to 696 million and 4.5 billion decreases, respectively, in gains from changes in fair value of derivatives included in cost of sales, as described above under the caption Net income . The unfavorable variances were partially offset by 79 million and 510 million decreases in cost of sales excluding the effect of derivative changes described above between the three and nine month periods, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023, primarily as a result of 76 million and 494 million decreases, respectively, in cost of natural gas feedstock largely due to lower U.S. natural gas prices . 
 
 Other income (expense) 
 
 The 45 million and 120 million favorable variances between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023 were primarily attributable to 44 million and 113 million decreases, respectively, in interest expense, net of capitalized interest, due to lower overall interest cost resulting from debt reduction activities and increase in the extent of interest costs qualifying for capitalization, given the higher carrying value of assets under construction. 
 
 Significant factor affecting our results of operations 
 
 Below is a significant factor that affects our results of operations. 
 
 Gains and losses on derivative instruments 
 
 Derivative instruments are utilized to manage our exposure to commodity-related marketing and price risks and are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For commodity derivative instruments related to our IPM agreements, the underlying LNG sales being economically hedged are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting, whereby revenues expected to be derived from the future LNG sales are recognized only upon delivery or realization of the underlying transaction. Notwithstanding the operational intent to mitigate risk exposure over time, the recognition of derivative instruments at fair value has the effect of recognizing gains or losses relating to future period exposure, and given the significant volumes, long-term duration and volatility in price basis for certain of our derivative contracts, the use of derivative instruments may result in continued volatility of our results of operations based on changes in market pricing, counterparty credit risk and other relevant factors that may be outside of our control. For example, as described in Note 5 Derivative Instruments of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the fair value of the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives incorporates, as applicable, market participant-based assumptions pertaining to certain contractual uncertainties, including those related to the availability of market information for delivery points, which may require future development of infrastructure, as well as the timing of satisfaction of certain events or development of infrastructure to support natural gas gathering and transport. We may recognize changes in fair value through earnings that could significantly impact our results of operations if and when such uncertainties are resolved.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The following information describes our ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet our requirements in the short term and the long term. In the short term, we expect to meet our cash requirements using operating cash flows and available liquidity, consisting of restricted cash and cash equivalents and available commitments under our credit facilities. Additionally, we expect to meet our long term cash requirements by using operating cash flows and other future potential sources of liquidity, which may include debt offerings. The table below provides a summary of our available liquidity (in millions). Future material sources of liquidity are discussed below. 
 September 30, 2024 Restricted cash and cash equivalents designated for the Liquefaction Project 
 78 Available commitments under our credit facilities (1): Term loan facility agreement (the CCH Credit Facility 
 3,260 Working capital facility agreement (the CCH Working Capital Facility 
 1,390 Total available commitments under our credit facilities 4,650 Total available liquidity 4,728 
 
 (1) Available commitments represent total commitments less loans outstanding and letters of credit issued under each of our credit facilities as of September 30, 2024. See Note 7 Debt of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our credit facilities and other debt instruments. 
 
 Our liquidity position subsequent to September 30, 2024 will be driven by future sources of liquidity and future cash requirements. For a discussion of our future sources and uses of liquidity, see the liquidity and capital resources disclosures in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Supplemental Guarantor Information 
 
 Certain debt obligations of CCH (the Guaranteed Obligations ), consisting of the 5.125 Senior Secured Notes due 2027, 3.700 Senior Secured Notes due 2029 and the series of Senior Secured Notes due 2039 with weighted average rate of 3.788 (collectively, the Senior Secured Notes ), are jointly and severally guaranteed by each of our consolidated subsidiaries, CCL, CCP and Corpus Christi Pipeline GP, LLC (each a Guarantor and collectively, the Guarantors ). 
 
 The Guarantors guarantees of such obligations are full and unconditional, subject to certain release provisions including (1) the sale, exchange, disposition or transfer (by merger, consolidation or otherwise) of all or substantially all of the capital stock or the assets of the Guarantors, (2) the designation of a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the indentures governing the respective debt instruments (the CCH Indentures ), (3) the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance or discharge of obligations under the CCH Indentures and (4) the release and discharge of the Guarantors pursuant to the Common Security and Account Agreement. In the event of a default in payment of the principal or interest by CCH, whether at maturity of the respective debt instrument or by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, legal proceedings may be instituted against the Guarantors to enforce the guarantee. 
 
 The Guaranteed Obligations contain affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for the respective debt instrument, including, with limited exceptions, restrictions on CCH s and the CCH Guarantors ability to incur additional indebtedness and/or liens, enter into hedging arrangements and/or engage in transactions with affiliates. The Guaranteed Obligations also include events of default that are customary for the respective debt instrument, which are subject to customary grace periods and materiality standards. 
 
 The rights of holders of the Guaranteed Obligations against the Guarantors may be limited under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or federal or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the Guarantor s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer under U.S. federal or state law. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of the Guarantors. Moreover, this provision may not be effective to protect the guarantee from being voided under fraudulent conveyance laws. There is a possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. 
 
 23 

Table of Contents 

The Guaranteed Obligations are CCH s senior secured obligations, ranking senior in right of payment to any and all of CCH s future indebtedness that is subordinated to the Guaranteed Obligations and equal in right of payment with CCH s other existing and future indebtedness that is senior and secured by the same collateral securing the Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of CCH under the Guaranteed Obligations are secured by substantially all of the assets of CCH and the Guarantors, as well as by all membership interests in CCH and each of the Guarantors on a pari passu basis with the CCH Credit Facility and the CCH Working Capital Facility. 
 Summarized financial information about us and the Guarantors as a group is omitted herein because such information would not be materially different from our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project 
 
 The following table summarizes the project completion and construction status of the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project as of September 30, 2024:

Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 The following table summarizes the sources and uses of our restricted cash and cash equivalents (in millions). The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, these amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures, including accruals, which are referred to elsewhere in this report. Additional discussion of these items follows the table. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,177 1,228 Net cash used in investing activities (1,475) (1,195) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 201 (641) Net decrease in restricted cash and cash equivalents (97) (608) 
 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 
 The 51 million decrease between the periods was primarily related to cash flows attributed to working capital, mainly due to differences in timing of payments to suppliers and cash collections from the sale of LNG cargoes. 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 
 Our investing net cash outflows in both periods primarily were for construction costs for the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project, which were 1.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.0 billion in the comparable period of 2023, as well as for optimization and other site improvement projects. We expect to incur a proportional level of capital expenditures for the remainder of the year as construction work progresses on the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project.

 6.2.1 For an LNG Tanker arriving at the pilot boarding station at any time prior to the FOB Delivery Window allocated to such LNG Tanker, a Notice of Readiness shall be deemed effective at the earlier of 6 00 a.m. Central Time on such FOB Delivery Window or the time at which the LNG Tanker is all fast at the berth 
 6.2.2 For an LNG Tanker arriving at the pilot boarding station at any time during the FOB Delivery Window allocated to such LNG Tanker, a Notice of Readiness shall become effective at the time of its issuance or 
 6.2.3 For an LNG Tanker arriving at the pilot boarding station at any time after the expiration of the FOB Delivery Window, a Notice of Readiness shall become effective upon Project Co s notice to the LNG Tanker that it is ready to receive the LNG Tanker at berth. 
 7. BERTHING ASSIGNMENT 
 7.1 Project Co shall berth an LNG Tanker which has tendered a valid Notice of Readiness before or during its FOB Delivery Window promptly after Project Co determines such LNG Tanker will not interfere with berthing and loading or unloading of any other scheduled LNG vessel with a higher berthing priority but in no event later than the end of the FOB Delivery Window allocated to such LNG Tanker provided, however, that if Project Co does not berth such LNG Tanker by the end of the FOB Delivery Window, but berths such LNG Tanker within seventy-two (72) hours after the end of its FOB Delivery Window, Transporter s sole recourse and remedy for Project Co s failure to berth the LNG Tanker by the end of the FOB Delivery Window is 
 7.1.1 demurrage pursuant to Paragraph 8.3, 
 7.1.2 payment for excess boil-off pursuant to Paragraph 8.4 and 
 7.1.3 provision by Project Co of a cool-down pursuant to Paragraph 13.1. 
 If, as of the seventy-second (72nd) hour after the end of the FOB Delivery Window, Project Co has not berthed the LNG Tanker, and such delay is not attributable to a reason that would result in an extension of Allotted Laytime under Paragraph 8.1, Project Co shall be deemed to have failed to make the FOB SCQ of the relevant cargo available for delivery and the provisions of Clause 16.2 shall apply. 
 7.2 For each delivery window period, Project Co shall determine the berthing priority among LNG vessels which have tendered a valid Notice of Readiness before or during their scheduled delivery window as follows 
 7.2.1 The first berthing priority for a delivery window period shall be for an LNG vessel scheduled for such delivery window period. Priority within this group shall be given to the LNG vessel which has first tendered Project Co its valid Notice of Readiness. Once an LNG vessel achieves a first berthing priority pursuant to this Paragraph 7.2.1 or Paragraph 7.2.2, such LNG vessel shall maintain such priority until such LNG vessel is berthed, so long as its tendered Notice of Readiness remains valid and 
 7.2.2 The second berthing priority for a delivery window period shall be for an LNG vessel scheduled for arrival after such delivery window period. Priority within this group shall be given to the LNG vessel which has first tendered Project Co its valid Notice of Readiness. An LNG vessel with second berthing priority pursuant to this Paragraph 7.2.2. will achieve a first berthing priority on its scheduled delivery window pursuant to Paragraph 7.2.1 if such LNG vessel has not been berthed prior to such date, so long as its tendered Notice of Readiness remains valid. 
 7.3 If an LNG Tanker tenders a valid Notice of Readiness after the end of its FOB Delivery Window, Project Co shall use reasonable efforts to berth such LNG Tanker as soon as reasonably practical provided, however, that, unless otherwise agreed with the Transporter, Project Co shall have no obligation to use such efforts to berth an LNG Tanker 
 94 

that tenders a Notice of Readiness more than seventy-two (72) hours after the end of its FOB Delivery Window. If, as of the seventy-second (72nd) hour after the end of the FOB Delivery Window, the LNG Tanker has not tendered a valid Notice of Readiness, and such delay is not attributable to a reason that would result in an extension of allowed berth time under Paragraph 10.2.2, the Transporter shall be deemed to have failed to take delivery of the FOB SCQ of the relevant cargo and the provisions of Clause 16.2.2 shall apply. 
 8. BERTH LAYTIME 
 8.1 The allotted laytime for each LNG Tanker Allotted Laytime shall be (i) for an LNG Tanker with an LNG cargo containment capacity of Cubic Meters or less, thirty-six (36) hours and (ii) for an LNG Tanker with an LNG cargo containment capacity of greater than Cubic Meters, according to the following formula 
 36 + x Allotted Laytime (in hours) 
 where 
 x y 12,000 Cubic Meters and 
 y the LNG cargo containment capacity of the LNG Tanker in excess of Cubic Meters). 
 8.2 Allotted Laytime shall be extended by any period of delay that is caused by 
 8.2.1 reasons attributable to the Transporter, a Governmental Authority, the LNG Tanker or its master, crew, owner or operator or any Third Party outside of the reasonable control of Project Co 
 8.2.2 force majeure or Adverse Weather Conditions 
 8.2.3 unscheduled curtailment or temporary discontinuation of operations at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) necessary for reasons of safety, except to the extent such unscheduled curtailment or temporary discontinuation of operations is due to Project Co s failure to operate and maintain its facilities as a Reasonable and Prudent Operator 
 8.2.4 time at berth during cool-down pursuant to Paragraphs 13.1.1 and 13.1.3 and 
 8.2.5 night-time transit restrictions. 
 8.3 The actual laytime for each LNG Tanker Actual Laytime shall commence when the Notice of Readiness is effective and shall end when (i) the LNG transfer and return lines of the LNG Tanker are disconnected from the Corpus Christi Facility s (or Alternate Production Facility s, as applicable) LNG transfer and return lines, (ii) the cargo documents are on board of the LNG Tanker and (iii) the LNG Tanker is cleared for departure and able to depart. 
 8.4 In the event Actual Laytime exceeds Allotted Laytime (including any extension in accordance with Paragraph 8.1) Demurrage Event ), Project Co shall pay to the Transporter as liquidated damages demurrage at the daily demurrage rate set forth in Section 7.13.3(a) of the DES SPA. If a Demurrage Event occurs, the Transporter shall invoice Project Co for such demurrage within one hundred eighty (180) Days of such event. 
 8.5 If an LNG Tanker is delayed in berthing at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) and or commencement of LNG transfer due to an event occurring at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) and for a reason that would not result in an extension of Allotted Laytime under Paragraph 8.1, and if, as a result thereof, the commencement of LNG transfer is delayed beyond twenty-four (24) hours after the Notice of Readiness is effective, then, for each full hour by which commencement of LNG transfer is delayed beyond such twenty-four (24) hour period, Project Co shall pay the Transporter as liquidated damages an amount, on account of excess boil-off, equal to the DES CSP applicable to such cargo, multiplied by a quantity equal to percent of the cargo containment capacity of the applicable LNG Tanker (in MMBtu), multiplied by the duration of the Demurrage Event (in hours). Transporter shall invoice Project Co for such excess boil-off within one hundred eighty (180) Days after the applicable event. 
 95 

9. LNG TRANSFERS 
 9.1 Project Co shall cooperate with the Transporter (or its agents) and with the master of each LNG Tanker to facilitate the continuous and efficient transfer of LNG hereunder. 
 9.2 During LNG transfer, Project Co shall provide or take receipt of (as applicable), through the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) vapour return line, Gas in such quantities as are necessary for the safe transfer of LNG at such rates, pressures and temperatures as may be required by the design of the LNG Tanker. 
 9.3 Promptly after completion of loading of each cargo, Project Co shall send to Transporter a certificate of origin, together with such other documents concerning the cargo as may reasonably be requested by DES Buyer. 
 9.4 The Transporter, in cooperation with Project Co, shall cause the LNG Tanker to depart safely and expeditiously from the berth upon completion of LNG transfer. 
 10. LNG TANKER NOT READY FOR LNG TRANSFER EXCESS LAYTIME 
 10.1 If any LNG Tanker previously believed to be ready for LNG transfer is determined to be not ready after being berthed, the Notice of Readiness shall be invalid, and Project Co may direct the LNG Tanker s master to vacate the berth and proceed to anchorage, whether or not other LNG vessels are awaiting the berth, unless it appears reasonably certain to Project Co that such LNG Tanker can be made ready without disrupting the overall berthing schedule of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) or operations of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable). When an unready LNG Tanker at anchorage becomes ready for LNG transfer, its master shall notify Project Co. If, as a result of such LNG Tanker s not being ready to load, Transporter fails to take a cargo, the provisions of Paragraph 11.1.5(B) of Part B of Schedule 2 shall apply. 
 10.2 The following shall apply with respect to berthing 
 10.2.1 An LNG Tanker shall complete LNG transfer and vacate the berth as soon as possible but not later than the following allowed laytime 
 (A) twenty-four (24) hours from the time the LNG Tanker is all fast at the berth, in the case of an LNG Tanker with an LNG cargo containment capacity less than or equal to Cubic Meters or 
 (B) in accordance with the following formula, in the case of an LNG Tanker with an LNG cargo containment capacity greater than Cubic Meters 
 24 + x allowed laytime (in hours) 
 where 
 x y 12,000 Cubic Meters and 
 y the LNG cargo containment capacity of the LNG Tanker in excess of Cubic Meters. 
 10.2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the allowed laytime shall be extended for (i) reasons attributable to Project Co or the operator of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) (ii) reasons attributable to a Governmental Authority (iii) reasons attributable to any Third Party outside of the reasonable control of Project Co (iv) time at berth during any cool-down pursuant to Paragraph 13.1 (v) unscheduled curtailment or temporary discontinuation of operations at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) necessary for reasons of safety, except to the extent attributable to Project Co or the Transporter (vi) force majeure and (vii) night-time transit restrictions. 
 10.2.3 If an LNG Tanker fails to depart at the end of its allowed laytime (as extended pursuant to Paragraph 10.2.2), another LNG vessel is awaiting the berth and the LNG Tanker s continued occupancy of the berth will disrupt the overall berthing schedule of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as 
 96 

applicable) or operations of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable), Project Co may direct the LNG Tanker to vacate the berth and proceed to sea at utmost dispatch. 
 10.2.4 If an LNG Tanker fails to depart the berth at the end of its allowed laytime (as extended pursuant to Paragraph 10.2.2) and as a result the subsequent LNG vessel is prevented from or delayed in loading or unloading, the Transporter shall reimburse Project Co for any and all actual documented demurrage or excess boil-off that Project Co becomes contractually obligated to pay to any Third Party with respect to such subsequent LNG vessel, as a result of the LNG Tanker not completing LNG transfer and vacating the berth as required by this Paragraph 10.2 provided that the Transporter shall not be required to reimburse Project Co for any amounts based on a demurrage rate or excess boil-off rate or price in excess of the amounts specified in Paragraphs 8.3 and 8.4, as applicable. Project Co shall invoice Transporter for any amounts due under this Paragraph 10.2.4 within one hundred eighty (180) Days after the relevant FOB Delivery Window. 
 10.2.5 In the event an LNG Tanker fails to vacate the berth pursuant to this Paragraph 10 and Transporter is not taking actions to cause it to vacate the berth, Project Co may effect such removal at the expense of Transporter. 
 11. COOPERATION 
 11.1 If any circumstance occurs or is foreseen to occur so as to cause delay to an LNG Tanker or any other LNG vessel in berthing, loading, unloading or departing, the Transporter and Project Co shall, without prejudice to any other provision of this Agreement, discuss the problem in good faith with each other and, if appropriate, with other users of the Loading Port, and the Parties shall use reasonable efforts to minimise or to avoid the delay, and at the same time shall cooperate with each other and with such other users of the Loading Port, as appropriate, to find countermeasures to minimise or to avoid the occurrence of any similar delay in the future. 
 11.2 With respect to an LNG Tanker scheduled to load a cargo at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable), if such LNG Tanker is unable to berth at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) by the end of its FOB Delivery Window solely due to a force majeure event, then the relevant cargo shall be cancelled, to the extent affected provided, however, that if requested by Transporter, Project Co shall use reasonable efforts to change the FOB ADP or Ninety Day Schedule in order to maximise the safe, reliable and efficient usage of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) and to assist the Transporter, or buyers having a firm contract to purchase LNG from the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) to load quantities of LNG which would otherwise have been loaded at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) during such cancelled FOB Delivery Windows or other affected delivery windows allocated to such buyers having a firm contract to purchase LNG from the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable).

 8. Samples for Quality Analysis 
 a) General . Representative liquid samples shall be collected from an appropriate point located as close as practical to the loading line starting one (1) hour after full loading rate is reached and ending one (1) hour before ramping down from the full loading rate. 
 Sampling conducted by Project Co will conform with the procedure specified in (i), (ii) or (iii) as follows 
 i) Online chromatograph A sample shall be taken and analyzed at least once every twenty (20) minutes by an on-line chromatograph during the sampling period referenced in the opening paragraph of section 8(a) of this Exhibit A. These intermittent samples will be passed through a vaporizer, and samples of the vaporized liquid will be analyzed. The arithmetically averaged analysis, representative of the delivered LNG cargo shall be used for all appropriate calculations. Samples taken when biphasic or where overheated LNG is suspected to be in the main transfer line will be disregarded. 
 In instances where the on-line chromatograph system being utilized were to fail during loading operations manual samples (composite or spot) collected shall be analyzed. 
 ii) Composite sample One (1) representative sample of the loading shall be collected by continuous sampling of the delivered LNG. If applicable the sample analysis shall be applied to the appropriate calculations associated with the delivered LNG cargo. 
 iii) Spot samples One (1) spot sample shall be collected from the vaporizer at each point in time corresponding to approximately twenty-five percent (25 ), fifty percent (50 and seventy-five percent (75 of loading is completed. If applicable the analysis of spot samples shall be conducted, averaged and applied to the appropriate calculations associated with the delivered LNG cargo.

From time to time, deviation checks shall be performed to verify the accuracy of the gas composition mole percentages and resulting calculated physical properties. Analyses of a sample of test gas of known composition resulting when procedures that are in accordance with the above mentioned standards have been applied will be considered as acceptable if the resulting calculated gross heating value is within plus or minus zero point three percent 0. 3 of the known gross heating value of the test gas sample. If the deviation exceeds the tolerance stated, the gross real heating value, relative density and compressibility previously calculated will be corrected immediately. Previous analyses will be corrected to the point where the error occurred, if this can be positively identified to the satisfaction of both Parties. Otherwise it shall be assumed that the drift has been linear since the last recalibration and correction shall be based on this assumption. 
 b) GPA Standard 2261 . All samples shall be analyzed by Project Co to determine the molar fraction of the hydrocarbon and other components in the sample by gas chromatography using a mutually agreed method in accordance with GPA Standard 2261 - Method of Analysis for Gas and Similar Gaseous Mixtures by Gas Chromatography, current as of January 1 st , 1990 and as periodically updated or as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties. If better standards for analysis are subsequently adopted by GPA or other recognized competent impartial authority, upon mutual agreement of the Transporter and Project Co, they shall be substituted for the standard then in use, but such substitution shall not take place retroactively. A calibration of the chromatograph or other analytical instrument used shall be performed by Project Co immediately prior to the analysis of the sample of LNG delivered. Project Co shall give advance notice to the Transporter of the time Project Co intends to conduct a calibration thereof, and the Transporter shall have the right to have a representative present at each such calibration provided, however, Project Co will not be obligated to defer or reschedule any calibration in order to permit the representative of the Transporter to be present.

Total sulfur will be determined as the summation of sulfur compounds (i.e. mercaptans) following ASTM D1988-06 (Standard Test Method for Mercaptans in Natural Gas using Length-of-Stain Detector Tubes). If the presence of Hydrogen Sulfide or sulfur compounds is detected, an additional test shall be performed to confirm the respective concentration(s) following either (i) ASTM D6228 (Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by Gas Chromatography and Flame Photometric Detection), (ii) ASTM D5504 (Determination of Sulfur 
 109 

Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence), (iii) ASTM D6667 (Determination of Total Volatile Sulfur in Gaseous Hydrocarbons and Liquefied Petroleum Gases by Ultraviolet Fluorescence), or (iv) any other testing method mutually agreed by the Parties. 
 10. Operating Procedures 
 a) Notice . Prior to conducting operations for measurement, gauging, sampling and analysis provided in this Exhibit A, the Party responsible for such operations shall notify the appropriate representatives of the other Party, allowing such representatives reasonable opportunity to be present for all operations and computations provided that the absence of the other Party s representative after notification and opportunity to attend shall not prevent any operations and computations from being performed. 
 b) Independent Surveyor . At the request of either Party any measurement, gauging, sampling and analysis shall be witnessed and verified by an independent surveyor mutually agreed upon by the Transporter and Project Co. The results of such surveyor s verifications shall be made available promptly to each Party. 
 c) Preservation of Records . All records of measurement and the computed results shall be preserved by the Party responsible for taking the same, or causing the same to be taken, and made available to the other Party for a period of not less than three (3) years after such measurement and computation. 
 11. Quantities Delivered 
 a) Calculation of MMBtu Quantities . Project Co shall calculate, or cause to be calculated and the Transporter shall verify, the quantity of MMBtu delivered. Either Party may, at its own expense, require the measurements and calculations and or their verification by an independent surveyor, mutually agreed upon by the Parties. Consent to an independent surveyor proposed by a Party shall not be unreasonably withheld by the other Party. 
 b) Determination of Gross Heating Value . All component values shall be in accordance with the latest revision of GPA Standard 2145 SI (2009) - Physical Constants for Hydrocarbons & Other Compounds of Interest to the Natural Gas Industry and the latest revision of the reference standards therein. Standard reference conditions for Hi component should be 15 C & 101.325 kPa. 
 c) Determination of Volume of LNG Loaded . 
 (i) The LNG volume in the tanks of the LNG Tanker before and after loading (valves have to be closed) shall be determined by gauging on the basis of the tank gauge tables provided for in Paragraph 6. During the period when measurement is occurring, no LNG cargo, ballast, boil-off gas, fuel oil or other cargo transfer activity will be carried out on the LNG Tanker. Measurements shall first be made immediately before loading commences. Accordingly, after connection of the loading arms, but prior to their cool-down, and immediately before opening the manifold ESD valves of the LNG Tanker, the initial gauging shall be conducted upon the confirmation of stoppage of all spray pumps and compressors and shut-off of the gas master valve to the LNG Tanker s boilers or any other gas consuming unit. The gas master valve to the LNG Tanker s boilers or any other gas consuming unit shall remain closed until after the second gauging, unless a regulatory change requires the consumption of gas during the vessel loading operations and or upon mutual agreement between all parties upon which event the procedure for the measurement of gas consumed during loading shall be calculated in accordance with Paragraph 12.4 of this Exhibit A. A second gauging shall be made immediately after loading is completed. Accordingly, the second gauging shall be conducted upon the confirmation of shut-off of the manifold ESD valves, with transfer pumps off and allowing sufficient time for the liquid level to stabilize. Measurements prior to loading and after loading will be carried out based on the condition of the LNG Tanker s lines upon arrival at berth. Since significant volumes of LNG may remain in the LNG Tanker s manifold and crossover, gauging will be performed with these lines in the same condition prior to loading and after loading. If the LNG Tanker s manifold and crossover lines are empty (warm) when 
 110 

measurement is taken before loading commences, they will be emptied prior to measurement following the completion of loading. If the crossover lines are liquid filled (cold) when measurement is taken before loading commences, they will remain full (cold) until measurement is taken following the completion of loading. The volume of LNG remaining in the tanks immediately before loading of the LNG Tanker shall be subtracted from the volume immediately after loading and the resulting volume shall be taken as the volume of the LNG delivered from the terminal to the LNG Tanker. 
 The volume of LNG stated in cubic meters to the nearest zero point zero zero one (0.001) cubic meter, shall be determined by using the tank gauge tables and by applying the volume corrections set forth therein. 
 (ii) Gas returned to the terminal and gas consumed by the LNG Tanker during loading shall be taken into account to determine the volume loaded for the Transporter s account in accordance with the formula in Paragraph 12.4 of this Exhibit A MMBtu Calculation of the Quantity of LNG Loaded. 
 (iii) If failure of the primary gauging and measuring devices of an LNG Tanker should make it impossible to determine the LNG volume, the volume of LNG loaded shall be determined by gauging the liquid level using the secondary gauging and measurement devices. If an LNG Tanker is not so equipped, the volume of LNG loaded shall be determined by gauging the liquid level in Project Co s onshore LNG storage tanks immediately before and after loading the LNG Tanker, in line with the terminal procedures, and such volume shall have subtracted from it an estimated LNG volume, agreed upon by the Parties, for boil-off from such tanks during the loading of such LNG Tanker. Project Co shall provide the Transporter, or cause the Transporter to be provided with, a certified copy of tank gauge tables for each onshore LNG tank which is to be used for this purpose, such tables to be verified by a competent impartial authority.

 12.4 MMBtu Calculation of the Quantity of LNG Loaded 
 The number of MMBtu contained in the LNG loaded shall be calculated using the following formula 
 
 The derivation of the conversion factor 1 1055.12 in the formula in this Paragraph for the conversion of MJ into MMBtu is obtained from GPA-2145 1994 and IP-251 1976 as follows 
 (a) q(T,P) means the gross heating value (measured at temperature T and pressure P), contained in a given quantity of gas 
 (b) q(60 F, 14.696 psia) in MJ 1 1.00006 x q(15 C, 1013.25 millibar) in MJ 
 (c) 1 MMBtu corresponds to 1055.06 MJ 
 (d) q(60 F, 14.696 psia) in MMBtu 1 1055.06 x q(60 F, 14.696 psia) in MJ and 
 (e) Combining (b) and (d) above yields 
 q(60 F, 14.696 psia) in MMBtu 1 1055.12 x q(15 C, 1013.25 millibar) in MJ. 
 Hence the number of MJ derived shall be divided by 1055.12 to obtain the number of MMBtu for invoicing purposes. 
 QBOG the quantity of boil off gas in MJ consumed by the LNG tanker during loading, calculated as follows 
 QBOG (V2 x 55.575) 
 where 
 V2 the quantity of natural gas consumed by the LNG tanker during loading (as calculated pursuant to the below formula), stated in kg and rounded to the nearest kg and 
 55.575 the heating value of the vapor (assumed to be 100 of methane) stated in MJ kg at standard reference conditions (15 C, 1.01325 bar) for both combustion & metering references (tables below). 
 Quantity of Natural Gas Consumed by LNG Tanker (V2) 
 The quantity of natural gas consumed by the LNG tanker during loading shall be computed by taking the initial and the final reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter on board the 
 113 

tanker (i.e. final reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter after completion of loading minus initial reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter before the start of loading) and is calculated by using the following formula 
 V2 Vf Vi 
 where 
 V2 the quantity of natural gas consumed by the LNG tanker during loading, stated in kg 
 Vf the reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter on board the tanker after the completion of loading, stated in kg and 
 Vi the reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter on board the tanker before the start of loading, stated in kg. 
 12.5 Calculation of Gross Heating Value (Volume Based) 
 The calculation of the Gross Heating Value (volume based) in Btu SCF shall be derived from the same compositional analysis as is used for the purposes of calculating the Gross Heating Value (mass based) Hm and the following formula shall apply 
 
 The derivation of the conversion factor 1.13285 for the conversion of MJ kmol into Btu SCF is obtained as follows 
 (a) molar gross heating value (Xi x Mi x Hi) MJ kmol 
 (b) 1 kmol 2.20462 lbmol 
 (c) 1 lbmol 379.482 SCF 
 (d) hence 1 kmol 836.614 SCF and 
 (e) Hv 1,000,000 (1055.12 x 836.614) x (Xi x Mi x Hi) Btu SCF

 6.1 The master of an LNG Tanker arriving at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable), or such master s agent, shall give to Project Co its Notice of Readiness for loading upon arrival of such LNG Tanker at the pilot boarding station, provided that such LNG Tanker has all required Approvals from the relevant Governmental Authorities, and is ready, willing, and able, to proceed to berth and load LNG or to commence cool-down operations (as applicable). 
 95 

6.2 A valid Notice of Readiness given under Paragraph 6.1 shall become effective as follows 
 6.2.1 For an LNG Tanker arriving at the pilot boarding station at any time prior to the FOB Delivery Window allocated to such LNG Tanker, a Notice of Readiness shall be deemed effective at the earlier of 6 00 a.m. Central Time on such FOB Delivery Window or the time at which the LNG Tanker is all fast at the berth 
 6.2.2 For an LNG Tanker arriving at the pilot boarding station at any time during the FOB Delivery Window allocated to such LNG Tanker, a Notice of Readiness shall become effective at the time of its issuance or 
 6.2.3 For an LNG Tanker arriving at the pilot boarding station at any time after the expiration of the FOB Delivery Window, a Notice of Readiness shall become effective upon Project Co s notice to the LNG Tanker that it is ready to receive the LNG Tanker at berth. 
 7. BERTHING ASSIGNMENT 
 7.1 Project Co shall berth an LNG Tanker which has tendered a valid Notice of Readiness before or during its FOB Delivery Window promptly after Project Co determines such LNG Tanker will not interfere with berthing and loading or unloading of any other scheduled LNG vessel with a higher berthing priority but in no event later than the end of the FOB Delivery Window allocated to such LNG Tanker provided, however, that if Project Co does not berth such LNG Tanker by the end of the FOB Delivery Window, but berths such LNG Tanker within seventy-two (72) hours after the end of its FOB Delivery Window, Transporter s sole recourse and remedy for Project Co s failure to berth the LNG Tanker by the end of the FOB Delivery Window is 
 7.1.1 demurrage pursuant to Paragraph 8.4, 
 7.1.2 payment for excess boil-off pursuant to Paragraph 8.5 and 
 7.1.3 provision by Project Co of a cool-down pursuant to Paragraph 13.1. 
 If, as of the seventy-second (72nd) hour after the end of the FOB Delivery Window, Project Co has not berthed the LNG Tanker, and such delay is not attributable to a reason that would result in an extension of Allotted Laytime under Paragraph 8.2, Project Co shall be deemed to have failed to make the FOB SCQ of the relevant cargo available for delivery and the provisions of Clause 16.2 shall apply. 
 7.2 For each delivery window period, Project Co shall determine the berthing priority among LNG vessels which have tendered a valid Notice of Readiness before or during their scheduled delivery window as follows 
 7.2.1 The first berthing priority for a delivery window period shall be for an LNG vessel scheduled for such delivery window period. Priority within this group shall be given to the LNG vessel which has first tendered Project Co its valid Notice of Readiness. Once an LNG vessel achieves a first berthing priority pursuant to this Paragraph 7.2.1 or Paragraph 7.2.2, such LNG vessel shall maintain such priority until such LNG vessel is berthed, so long as its tendered Notice of Readiness remains valid and 
 7.2.2 The second berthing priority for a delivery window period shall be for an LNG vessel scheduled for arrival after such delivery window period. Priority within this group shall be given to the LNG vessel which has first tendered Project Co its valid Notice of Readiness. An LNG vessel with second berthing priority pursuant to this Paragraph 7.2.2. will achieve a first berthing priority on its scheduled delivery window pursuant to Paragraph 7.2.1 if such LNG vessel has not been berthed prior to such date, so long as its tendered Notice of Readiness remains valid. 
 7.3 If an LNG Tanker tenders a valid Notice of Readiness after the end of its FOB Delivery Window, Project Co shall use reasonable efforts to berth such LNG Tanker as soon as reasonably practical provided, however, that, unless otherwise agreed with the Transporter, Project Co shall have no obligation to use such efforts to berth an LNG Tanker that tenders a Notice of Readiness more than seventy-two (72) hours after the end of its 
 96 

FOB Delivery Window. If, as of the seventy-second (72nd) hour after the end of the FOB Delivery Window, the LNG Tanker has not tendered a valid Notice of Readiness, and such delay is not attributable to a reason that would result in an extension of allowed berth time under Paragraph 10.2.2, the Transporter shall be deemed to have failed to take delivery of the FOB SCQ of the relevant cargo and the provisions of Clause 16.2.2 shall apply. 
 8. BERTH LAYTIME 
 8.1 The allotted laytime for each LNG Tanker Allotted Laytime shall be (i) for an LNG Tanker with an LNG cargo containment capacity of Cubic Meters or less, thirty-six (36) hours and (ii) for an LNG Tanker with an LNG cargo containment capacity of greater than Cubic Meters, according to the following formula 
 36 + x Allotted Laytime (in hours) 
 where 
 x y 12,000 Cubic Meters and 
 y the LNG cargo containment capacity of the LNG Tanker in excess of Cubic Meters). 
 8.2 Allotted Laytime shall be extended by any period of delay that is caused by 
 8.2.1 reasons attributable to the Transporter, a Governmental Authority, the LNG Tanker or its master, crew, owner or operator or any Third Party outside of the reasonable control of Project Co 
 8.2.2 force majeure or Adverse Weather Conditions 
 8.2.3 unscheduled curtailment or temporary discontinuation of operations at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) necessary for reasons of safety, except to the extent such unscheduled curtailment or temporary discontinuation of operations is due to Project Co s failure to operate and maintain its facilities as a Reasonable and Prudent Operator 
 8.2.4 time at berth during cool-down pursuant to Paragraphs 13.1.1 and 13.1.3 and 
 8.2.5 night-time transit restrictions. 
 8.3 The actual laytime for each LNG Tanker Actual Laytime shall commence when the Notice of Readiness is effective and shall end when (i) the LNG transfer and return lines of the LNG Tanker are disconnected from the Corpus Christi Facility s (or Alternate Production Facility s, as applicable) LNG transfer and return lines, (ii) the cargo documents are on board of the LNG Tanker and (iii) the LNG Tanker is cleared for departure and able to depart. 
 8.4 In the event Actual Laytime exceeds Allotted Laytime (including any extension in accordance with Paragraph 8.2) Demurrage Event ), Project Co shall pay to the Transporter as liquidated damages demurrage at the daily demurrage rate set forth in Section 7.13.3(a) of the DES SPA. If a Demurrage Event occurs, the Transporter shall invoice Project Co for such demurrage within one hundred eighty (180) Days of such event. 
 97 

8.5 If an LNG Tanker is delayed in berthing at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) and or commencement of LNG transfer due to an event occurring at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) and for a reason that would not result in an extension of Allotted Laytime under Paragraph 8.2, and if, as a result thereof, the commencement of LNG transfer is delayed beyond twenty-four (24) hours after the Notice of Readiness is effective, then, for each full hour by which commencement of LNG transfer is delayed beyond such twenty-four (24) hour period, Project Co shall pay the Transporter as liquidated damages an amount, on account of excess boil-off, equal to the DES CSP applicable to such cargo, multiplied by a quantity equal to percent of the cargo containment capacity of the applicable LNG Tanker (in MMBtu), multiplied by the duration of the Demurrage Event (in hours). Transporter shall invoice Project Co for such excess boil-off within one hundred eighty (180) Days after the applicable event. 
 9. LNG TRANSFERS 
 9.1 Project Co shall cooperate with the Transporter (or its agents) and with the master of each LNG Tanker to facilitate the continuous and efficient transfer of LNG hereunder. 
 9.2 During LNG transfer, Project Co shall provide or take receipt of (as applicable), through the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) vapour return line, Gas in such quantities as are necessary for the safe transfer of LNG at such rates, pressures and temperatures as may be required by the design of the LNG Tanker. 
 9.3 Promptly after completion of loading of each cargo, Project Co shall send to Transporter a certificate of origin, together with such other documents concerning the cargo as may reasonably be requested by DES Buyer. 
 9.4 The Transporter, in cooperation with Project Co, shall cause the LNG Tanker to depart safely and expeditiously from the berth upon completion of LNG transfer. 
 10. LNG TANKER NOT READY FOR LNG TRANSFER EXCESS LAYTIME 
 10.1 If any LNG Tanker previously believed to be ready for LNG transfer is determined to be not ready after being berthed, the Notice of Readiness shall be invalid, and Project Co may direct the LNG Tanker s master to vacate the berth and proceed to anchorage, whether or not other LNG vessels are awaiting the berth, unless it appears reasonably certain to Project Co that such LNG Tanker can be made ready without disrupting the overall berthing schedule of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) or operations of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable). When an unready LNG Tanker at anchorage becomes ready for LNG transfer, its master shall notify Project Co. If, as a result of such LNG Tanker s not being ready to load, Transporter fails to take a cargo, the provisions of Paragraph 11.1.5(B) of Part B Schedule 2 shall apply. 
 10.2 The following shall apply with respect to berthing 
 10.2.1 An LNG Tanker shall complete LNG transfer and vacate the berth as soon as possible but not later than the following allowed laytime 
 (A) twenty-four (24) hours from the time the LNG Tanker is all fast at the berth, in the case of an LNG Tanker with an LNG cargo containment capacity less than or equal to Cubic Meters or 
 (B) in accordance with the following formula, in the case of an LNG Tanker with an LNG cargo containment capacity greater than Cubic Meters 
 24 + x allowed laytime (in hours) 
 where 
 x y 12,000 Cubic Meters and 
 y the LNG cargo containment capacity of the LNG Tanker in excess of Cubic Meters. 
 98 

10.2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the allowed laytime shall be extended for (i) reasons attributable to Project Co or the operator of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) (ii) reasons attributable to a Governmental Authority (iii) reasons attributable to any Third Party outside of the reasonable control of Project Co (iv) time at berth during any cool-down pursuant to Paragraph 13.1 (v) unscheduled curtailment or temporary discontinuation of operations at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) necessary for reasons of safety, except to the extent attributable to Project Co or the Transporter (vi) force majeure and (vii) night-time transit restrictions. 
 10.2.3 If an LNG Tanker fails to depart at the end of its allowed laytime (as extended pursuant to Paragraph 10.2.2), another LNG vessel is awaiting the berth and the LNG Tanker s continued occupancy of the berth will disrupt the overall berthing schedule of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) or operations of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable), Project Co may direct the LNG Tanker to vacate the berth and proceed to sea at utmost dispatch. 
 10.2.4 If an LNG Tanker fails to depart the berth at the end of its allowed laytime (as extended pursuant to Paragraph 10.2.2) and as a result the subsequent LNG vessel is prevented from or delayed in loading or unloading, the Transporter shall reimburse Project Co for any and all actual documented demurrage or excess boil-off that Project Co becomes contractually obligated to pay to any Third Party with respect to such subsequent LNG vessel, as a result of the LNG Tanker not completing LNG transfer and vacating the berth as required by this Paragraph 10.2 provided that the Transporter shall not be required to reimburse Project Co for any amounts based on a demurrage rate or excess boil-off rate or price in excess of the amounts specified in Paragraphs 8.4 and 8.5, as applicable. Project Co shall invoice Transporter for any amounts due under this Paragraph 10.2.4 within one hundred eighty (180) Days after the relevant FOB Delivery Window. 
 10.2.5 In the event an LNG Tanker fails to vacate the berth pursuant to this Paragraph 10 and Transporter is not taking actions to cause it to vacate the berth, Project Co may effect such removal at the expense of Transporter. 
 11. COOPERATION 
 11.1 If any circumstance occurs or is foreseen to occur so as to cause delay to an LNG Tanker or any other LNG vessel in berthing, loading, unloading or departing, the Transporter and Project Co shall, without prejudice to any other provision of this Agreement, discuss the problem in good faith with each other and, if appropriate, with other users of the Loading Port, and the Parties shall use reasonable efforts to minimise or to avoid the delay, and at the same time shall cooperate with each other and with such other users of the Loading Port, as appropriate, to find countermeasures to minimise or to avoid the occurrence of any similar delay in the future. 
 11.2 With respect to an LNG Tanker scheduled to load a cargo at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable), if such LNG Tanker is unable to berth at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) by the end of its FOB Delivery Window solely due to a force majeure event, then the relevant cargo shall be cancelled, to the extent affected provided, however, that if requested by Transporter, Project Co shall use reasonable efforts to change the FOB ADP or Ninety Day Schedule in order to maximise the safe, reliable and efficient usage of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) and to assist the Transporter, or buyers having a firm contract to purchase LNG from the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) to load quantities of LNG which would otherwise have been loaded at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) during such cancelled FOB Delivery Windows or other affected delivery windows allocated to such buyers having a firm contract to purchase LNG from the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable). 
 99

 i) Online chromatograph A sample shall be taken and analyzed at least once every twenty (20) minutes by an on-line chromatograph during the sampling period referenced in the opening paragraph of section 8(a) of this Exhibit A. These intermittent samples will be passed through a vaporizer, and samples of the vaporized liquid will be analyzed. The arithmetically averaged analysis, representative of the delivered LNG cargo shall be used for all appropriate calculations. Samples taken when biphasic or where overheated LNG is suspected to be in the main transfer line will be disregarded. 
 In instances where the on-line chromatograph system being utilized were to fail during loading operations manual samples (composite or spot) collected shall be analyzed. 
 ii) Composite sample One (1) representative sample of the loading shall be collected by continuous sampling of the delivered LNG. If applicable the sample analysis shall be applied to the appropriate calculations associated with the delivered LNG cargo. 
 iii) Spot samples One (1) spot sample shall be collected from the vaporizer at each point in time corresponding to approximately twenty-five percent (25 ), fifty percent (50 and seventy-five percent (75 of loading is completed. If applicable the analysis of spot samples shall be conducted, averaged and applied to the appropriate calculations associated with the delivered LNG cargo. 
 b) Manual Samples . It is recognized that for every loading manual samples should be retained for use by the Transporter and Project Co. 
 i) Where sampling analysis is conducted using spot samples per section 8(a)iii of this Exhibit A, two (2) sets of samples shall be collected from the vaporizer at each point in time corresponding to approximately twenty-five percent (25 ), fifty percent (50 and seventy-five percent (75 of loading is completed and retained. 
 111 

ii) Where sampling analysis is conducted using a composite sample per section 8(a)ii of this Exhibit A, two (2) samples shall be collected from the collection devices at the end of loading and retained. 
 The samples collected shall be properly labeled and sealed by the independent surveyor in attendance. Project Co shall retain all samples for a period of thirty (30) Days, unless the analysis is disputed prior to the end of such thirty (30) Day period. If the analysis is in dispute, the samples will be retained until the dispute is resolved.

 Where the Transporter receives a set of samples, the Transporter shall return the set of sample cylinders provided or an identical set within sixty (60) Days. If the set of sample cylinders provided are not returned or replaced to Project Co s satisfaction within the sixty (60) Day period, Project Co will procure replacement cylinders and the Transporter will be invoiced for the cost of replacement cylinders inclusive of preparation cost. 
 Sampling and analysis methods and procedures that differ from the above may be employed with the mutual agreement of the Parties. 
 9. Quality Analysis 
 a) Certification and Deviation . Chromatograph calibration gasses shall be provided and their composition certified by an independent third party. From time to time, deviation checks shall be performed to verify the accuracy of the gas composition mole percentages and resulting calculated physical properties. Analyses of a sample of test gas of known composition resulting when procedures that are in accordance with the above mentioned standards have been applied will be considered as acceptable if the resulting calculated gross heating value is within plus or minus zero point three percent 0. 3 of the known gross heating value of the test gas sample. If the deviation exceeds the tolerance stated, the gross real heating value, relative density and compressibility previously calculated will be corrected immediately. Previous analyses will be corrected to the point where the error occurred, if this can be positively identified to the satisfaction of both Parties. Otherwise it shall be assumed that the drift has been linear since the last recalibration and correction shall be based on this assumption. 
 b) GPA Standard 2261 . All samples shall be analyzed by Project Co to determine the molar fraction of the hydrocarbon and other components in the sample by gas chromatography using a mutually agreed method in accordance with GPA Standard 2261 - Method of Analysis for Gas and Similar Gaseous Mixtures by Gas Chromatography, current as of January 1 st , 1990 and as periodically updated or as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties. If better standards for analysis are subsequently adopted by GPA or other recognized competent impartial authority, upon mutual agreement of the Transporter and Project Co, they shall be substituted for the standard then in use, but such substitution shall not take place retroactively. A calibration of the chromatograph or other analytical instrument used shall be performed by Project Co immediately prior to the analysis of the sample of LNG delivered. Project Co shall give advance notice to the Transporter of the time Project Co intends to conduct a calibration thereof, and the Transporter shall have the right to have a representative present at each such calibration provided, however, Project Co will not be obligated to defer or reschedule any calibration in order to permit the representative of the Transporter to be present. 
 c) GPA Standard 2377 . Project Co shall determine the presence of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) by use of GPA Standard 2377 Test of Hydrogen Sulfide and Carbon Dioxide in Gas Using Length of Stain Tubes. Total sulfur will be determined as the summation of sulfur compounds (i.e. mercaptans) following ASTM D1988-06 (Standard Test Method for Mercaptans in Natural Gas using Length-of-Stain Detector Tubes). If the presence of Hydrogen Sulfide or sulfur compounds is detected, an additional test shall be performed to confirm the respective concentration(s) following either (i) ASTM D6228 (Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by Gas Chromatography and Flame Photometric Detection), (ii) ASTM D5504 (Determination of Sulfur 
 112 

Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence), (iii) ASTM D6667 (Determination of Total Volatile Sulfur in Gaseous Hydrocarbons and Liquefied Petroleum Gases by Ultraviolet Fluorescence), or (iv) any other testing method mutually agreed by the Parties. 
 10. Operating Procedures 
 a) Notice . Prior to conducting operations for measurement, gauging, sampling and analysis provided in this Exhibit A, the Party responsible for such operations shall notify the appropriate representatives of the other Party, allowing such representatives reasonable opportunity to be present for all operations and computations provided that the absence of the other Party s representative after notification and opportunity to attend shall not prevent any operations and computations from being performed. 
 b) Independent Surveyor . At the request of either Party any measurement, gauging, sampling and analysis shall be witnessed and verified by an independent surveyor mutually agreed upon by the Transporter and Project Co. The results of such surveyor s verifications shall be made available promptly to each Party. 
 c) Preservation of Records . All records of measurement and the computed results shall be preserved by the Party responsible for taking the same, or causing the same to be taken, and made available to the other Party for a period of not less than three (3) years after such measurement and computation. 
 11. Quantities Delivered 
 a) Calculation of MMBtu Quantities . Project Co shall calculate, or cause to be calculated and the Transporter shall verify, the quantity of MMBtu delivered. Either Party may, at its own expense, require the measurements and calculations and or their verification by an independent surveyor, mutually agreed upon by the Parties. Consent to an independent surveyor proposed by a Party shall not be unreasonably withheld by the other Party. 
 b) Determination of Gross Heating Value . All component values shall be in accordance with the latest revision of GPA Standard 2145 SI (2009) - Physical Constants for Hydrocarbons & Other Compounds of Interest to the Natural Gas Industry and the latest revision of the reference standards therein. Standard reference conditions for Hi component should be 15 C & 101.325 kPa. 
 c) Determination of Volume of LNG Loaded . 
 (i) The LNG volume in the tanks of the LNG Tanker before and after loading (valves have to be closed) shall be determined by gauging on the basis of the tank gauge tables provided for in Paragraph 6. During the period when measurement is occurring, no LNG cargo, ballast, boil-off gas, fuel oil or other cargo transfer activity will be carried out on the LNG Tanker. Measurements shall first be made immediately before loading commences. Accordingly, after connection of the loading arms, but prior to their cool-down, and immediately before opening the manifold ESD valves of the LNG Tanker, the initial gauging shall be conducted upon the confirmation of stoppage of all spray pumps and compressors and shut-off of the gas master valve to the LNG Tanker s boilers or any other gas consuming unit. The gas master valve to the LNG Tanker s boilers or any other gas consuming unit shall remain closed until after the second gauging, unless a regulatory change requires the consumption of gas during the vessel loading operations and or upon mutual agreement between all parties upon which event the procedure for the measurement of gas consumed during loading shall be calculated in accordance with Paragraph 12.4 of this Exhibit A. A second gauging shall be made immediately after loading is completed. Accordingly, the second gauging shall be conducted upon the confirmation of shut-off of the manifold ESD valves, with transfer pumps off and allowing sufficient time for the liquid level to stabilize. Measurements prior to loading and after loading will be carried out based on the condition of the LNG Tanker s lines upon arrival at berth. Since significant volumes of LNG may remain in the LNG Tanker s manifold and crossover, gauging will be performed with these lines in the same condition prior to loading and after loading. If the LNG Tanker s manifold and crossover lines are empty (warm) when 
 113 

measurement is taken before loading commences, they will be emptied prior to measurement following the completion of loading. If the crossover lines are liquid filled (cold) when measurement is taken before loading commences, they will remain full (cold) until measurement is taken following the completion of loading. The volume of LNG remaining in the tanks immediately before loading of the LNG Tanker shall be subtracted from the volume immediately after loading and the resulting volume shall be taken as the volume of the LNG delivered from the terminal to the LNG Tanker. 
 The volume of LNG stated in cubic meters to the nearest zero point zero zero one (0.001) cubic meter, shall be determined by using the tank gauge tables and by applying the volume corrections set forth therein. 
 (ii) Gas returned to the terminal and gas consumed by the LNG Tanker during loading shall be taken into account to determine the volume loaded for the Transporter s account in accordance with the formula in Paragraph 12.4 of this Exhibit A MMBtu Calculation of the Quantity of LNG Loaded. 
 (iii) If failure of the primary gauging and measuring devices of an LNG Tanker should make it impossible to determine the LNG volume, the volume of LNG loaded shall be determined by gauging the liquid level using the secondary gauging and measurement devices. If an LNG Tanker is not so equipped, the volume of LNG loaded shall be determined by gauging the liquid level in Project Co s onshore LNG storage tanks immediately before and after loading the LNG Tanker, in line with the terminal procedures, and such volume shall have subtracted from it an estimated LNG volume, agreed upon by the Parties, for boil-off from such tanks during the loading of such LNG Tanker. Project Co shall provide the Transporter, or cause the Transporter to be provided with, a certified copy of tank gauge tables for each onshore LNG tank which is to be used for this purpose, such tables to be verified by a competent impartial authority.

 In the application of the above formula, no intermediate rounding shall be made if the accuracy of d is thereby affected. 
 12.2 Calculation of Volume Delivered 
 The volume, in cubic meters, of each LNG cargo loaded shall be calculated by using the following formula 
 
 115 

12.3 Calculation of Gross Heating Value (Mass Based) 
 The gross heating value (mass based), in MJ kg, of each LNG cargo loaded shall be calculated by using the following formula 
 
 12.4 MMBtu Calculation of the Quantity of LNG Loaded 
 The number of MMBtu contained in the LNG loaded shall be calculated using the following formula 
 
 The derivation of the conversion factor 1 1055.12 in the formula in this Paragraph for the conversion of MJ into MMBtu is obtained from GPA-2145 1994 and IP-251 1976 as follows 
 (a) q(T,P) means the gross heating value (measured at temperature T and pressure P), contained in a given quantity of gas 
 (b) q(60 F, 14.696 psia) in MJ 1 1.00006 x q(15 C, 1013.25 millibar) in MJ 
 (c) 1 MMBtu corresponds to 1055.06 MJ 
 (d) q(60 F, 14.696 psia) in MMBtu 1 1055.06 x q(60 F, 14.696 psia) in MJ and 
 (e) Combining (b) and (d) above yields 
 q(60 F, 14.696 psia) in MMBtu 1 1055.12 x q(15 C, 1013.25 millibar) in MJ. 
 Hence the number of MJ derived shall be divided by 1055.12 to obtain the number of MMBtu for invoicing purposes. 
 QBOG the quantity of boil off gas in MJ consumed by the LNG tanker during loading, calculated as follows 
 QBOG (V2 x 55.575) 
 where 
 V2 the quantity of natural gas consumed by the LNG tanker during loading (as calculated pursuant to the below formula), stated in kg and rounded to the nearest kg and 
 55.575 the heating value of the vapor (assumed to be 100 of methane) stated in MJ kg at standard reference conditions (15 C, 1.01325 bar) for both combustion & metering references (tables below). 
 Quantity of Natural Gas Consumed by LNG Tanker (V2) 
 The quantity of natural gas consumed by the LNG tanker during loading shall be computed by taking the initial and the final reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter on board the 
 116 

tanker (i.e. final reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter after completion of loading minus initial reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter before the start of loading) and is calculated by using the following formula 
 V2 Vf Vi 
 where 
 V2 the quantity of natural gas consumed by the LNG tanker during loading, stated in kg 
 Vf the reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter on board the tanker after the completion of loading, stated in kg and 
 Vi the reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter on board the tanker before the start of loading, stated in kg. 
 12.5 Calculation of Gross Heating Value (Volume Based) 
 The calculation of the Gross Heating Value (volume based) in Btu SCF shall be derived from the same compositional analysis as is used for the purposes of calculating the Gross Heating Value (mass based) Hm and the following formula shall apply 
 
 The derivation of the conversion factor 1.13285 for the conversion of MJ kmol into Btu SCF is obtained as follows 
 (a) molar gross heating value (Xi x Mi x Hi) MJ kmol 
 (b) 1 kmol 2.20462 lbmol 
 (c) 1 lbmol 379.482 SCF 
 (d) hence 1 kmol 836.614 SCF and 
 (e) Hv 1,000,000 (1055.12 x 836.614) x (Xi x Mi x Hi) Btu SCF

 11.1.1 In respect of each Diverted Cargo, the Transporter shall take and pay for the FOB SCQ set forth in the FOB ADP or FOB Ninety Day Schedule, less 
 (A) any quantities of LNG not made available by Project Co for any reasons attributable to Project Co (other than quantities for which Project Co is excused pursuant to this Agreement from making available due to the Transporter s breach of this Agreement) including quantities not made available by Project Co due to Diverted Cargo Force Majeure affecting Project Co or the Corpus Christi Facility 
 (B) any quantities of LNG not taken by the Transporter for reasons of Diverted Cargo Force Majeure 
 (C) quantities of LNG for which the Transporter has provided a notice of cancellation pursuant to Paragraph 1.4 of Part A of Schedule 2 
 67 

(D) any quantity that the relevant LNG Tanker is not capable of loading due to Project Co s delivery of LNG that has a Gross Heating Value that is less than the value identified by Project Co pursuant to Paragraph 1.2.1 of Schedule 5 and 
 (E) quantities rejected by the Transporter in accordance with Paragraph 11.2.6. 
 11.1.2 If, with respect to any Diverted Cargo identified in Paragraph 11.1.1, the Transporter does not take all or part of the FOB SCQ of such cargo, and such failure to take is not otherwise excused pursuant to Paragraph 11.1.1, then the amount by which the FOB SCQ for such cargo exceeds the quantity of LNG taken by the Transporter in relation to such cargo shall be the Diverted Cargo Shortfall Quantity . 
 11.1.3 With respect to any Diverted Cargo Shortfall Quantity, the Transporter shall pay to Project Co Cover Damages, if Cover Damages are a positive amount, in accordance with the following 
 (A) Cover Damages shall be equal to (i) the FOB Price, multiplied by the Diverted Cargo Shortfall Quantity minus (ii) the proceeds of any Diverted Cargo Mitigation Sale, if any minus (iii) reasonable and verifiable savings obtained by Project Co (including savings related to avoided fuel Gas for LNG production, transportation and Third Party costs avoided) as a result of the Diverted Cargo Mitigation Sale as opposed to the sale to the Transporter plus (iv) any actual, reasonable, verifiable, incremental costs incurred by Project Co as a result of such Diverted Cargo Mitigation Sale (including costs related to transporting, marketing, selling, and delivery of the Diverted Cargo Shortfall Quantity). For purposes of calculating Cover Damages, the FOB Price shall be determined as of the Month in which the applicable FOB Delivery Window begins. 
 (B) Project Co shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate its Losses and reduce Cover Damages payable resulting from the Transporter's failure to take such Diverted Cargo Shortfall Quantity by reselling such Diverted Cargo Shortfall Quantity (whether as LNG or Gas) to Third Parties (each such sale a Diverted Cargo Mitigation Sale except that any sale of a quantity of LNG (or Gas) by Project Co to any Third Party that Project Co was already obligated to make at the earlier to occur of (i) the Transporter s failure to take such LNG or (ii) the Transporter s notice to Project Co that it will not take such LNG, is not a Diverted Cargo Mitigation Sale. 
 (C) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Diverted Cargo Shortfall Quantity is within the operational tolerance of two percent (2 of the FOB SCQ for such Diverted Cargo Operational Tolerance (such Operational Tolerance to be exercised by Transporter only with respect to operational matters regarding the LNG Tanker, and without regard to Gas markets or other commercial considerations), the Cover Damages shall be zero USD (US 0.00). 
 11.1.4 Any payment that Transporter makes under this Paragraph 11.1 shall not be limited by Clause 16.4.1. 
 11.1.5 For the purposes of this Part B of Schedule 2, the FOB Price shall be calculated as follows 
 (A) in respect of any Loaded Cargo, the FOB Price shall be an amount equal to the FOB CSP (as defined in Clause 11.1.2) multiplied by the loaded quantity of the Loaded Cargo and 
 (B) in respect of any cargo that is not loaded by the Transporter hereunder, the FOB Price shall be an amount equal to the FOB CSP (as defined in Clause 11.1.2) multiplied by the FOB SCQ of such cargo, 
 in each case where 'FOB CSP' shall have the meaning given in Clause 11.1.2. 
 68

 11.2.2 Except as otherwise excused pursuant to this Agreement, if for any reason other than those specified in Paragraph 11.2.1, Project Co does not make available the FOB SCQ in respect of any Diverted Cargo identified in Paragraph 11.2.1 then the amount by which the FOB SCQ for such Diverted Cargo exceeds the quantity of LNG made available by Project Co shall be the Diverted Cargo DoP Quantity . Project Co shall make a payment to the Transporter for each MMBtu of the Diverted Cargo DoP Quantity in an amount equal to (a) the actual, documented price incurred by the Transporter for the purchase of a replacement quantity of LNG or Gas (not to exceed the MMBtu equivalent of the Diverted Cargo DoP Quantity), or, in respect of any Diverted Cargo DoP Quantity for which a replacement quantity cannot be purchased, the market price of LNG at such time for delivery FOB in the U.S. Gulf Coast less (b) the FOB Price plus (c) any actual, reasonable, and verifiable costs (if any), incurred by Transporter due to such failure, including costs associated with transportation plus (d) any actual, verifiable costs incurred by the Transporter in respect of idling the LNG Tanker scheduled to load the Diverted Cargo DoP Quantity less (e) actual, reasonable, and verifiable cost savings realised by the Transporter due to Project Co s failure to make the FOB SCQ for such Diverted Cargo available (the Diverted Cargo DoP Payment ). For the purposes of calculating the Diverted Cargo DoP Payment, the FOB Price shall be determined as of the Month in which the applicable FOB Delivery Window begins. 
 11.2.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Diverted Cargo DoP Quantity is within the Operational Tolerance (such Operational Tolerance to be exercised by Project Co only with respect to operational matters regarding the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable), and without regard to Gas markets or other commercial considerations), the Diverted Cargo DoP Payment shall be zero USD (US 0.00). 
 11.2.4 The Transporter shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate Project Co s liability to make any payments pursuant to this Paragraph 11.2. 
 11.2.5 In the event the ability of the Corpus Christi Facility to produce and deliver LNG is impaired due to an unscheduled services interruption that does not constitute Diverted Cargo Force Majeure, then during such event of interruption, Project Co shall comply with the Foundation Customer Priority in allocating the LNG that is available from the Corpus Christi Facility. 
 11.2.6 If as a result of Project Co s failure to make available the FOB SCQ in respect of a Diverted Cargo, a partial cargo is made available to the Transporter, and the master of the relevant LNG Tanker deems in his sole discretion the loading of such quantity unsafe for loading and or transporting to the relevant Receiving Terminal, then the Transporter may reject such quantity and such quantity shall be added to the Diverted Cargo DoP Quantity. 
 11.2.7 Any payment that Project Co makes under this Paragraph 11.2 shall not be limited by Clause 16.4.1. 
 69

 6.1 The master of an LNG Tanker arriving at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable), or such master s agent, shall give to Project Co its Notice of Readiness for loading upon arrival of such LNG Tanker at the pilot boarding station, provided that such LNG Tanker has all required Approvals from the relevant Governmental Authorities, and is ready, willing, and able, to proceed to berth and load LNG or to commence cool-down operations (as applicable). 
 95 

6.2 A valid Notice of Readiness given under Paragraph 6.1 shall become effective as follows 
 6.2.1 For an LNG Tanker arriving at the pilot boarding station at any time prior to the FOB Delivery Window allocated to such LNG Tanker, a Notice of Readiness shall be deemed effective at the earlier of 6 00 a.m. Central Time on such FOB Delivery Window or the time at which the LNG Tanker is all fast at the berth 
 6.2.2 For an LNG Tanker arriving at the pilot boarding station at any time during the FOB Delivery Window allocated to such LNG Tanker, a Notice of Readiness shall become effective at the time of its issuance or 
 6.2.3 For an LNG Tanker arriving at the pilot boarding station at any time after the expiration of the FOB Delivery Window, a Notice of Readiness shall become effective upon Project Co s notice to the LNG Tanker that it is ready to receive the LNG Tanker at berth. 
 7. BERTHING ASSIGNMENT 
 7.1 Project Co shall berth an LNG Tanker which has tendered a valid Notice of Readiness before or during its FOB Delivery Window promptly after Project Co determines such LNG Tanker will not interfere with berthing and loading or unloading of any other scheduled LNG vessel with a higher berthing priority but in no event later than the end of the FOB Delivery Window allocated to such LNG Tanker provided, however, that if Project Co does not berth such LNG Tanker by the end of the FOB Delivery Window, but berths such LNG Tanker within seventy-two (72) hours after the end of its FOB Delivery Window, Transporter s sole recourse and remedy for Project Co s failure to berth the LNG Tanker by the end of the FOB Delivery Window is 
 7.1.1 demurrage pursuant to Paragraph 8.4, 
 7.1.2 payment for excess boil-off pursuant to Paragraph 8.5 and 
 7.1.3 provision by Project Co of a cool-down pursuant to Paragraph 13.1. 
 If, as of the seventy-second (72nd) hour after the end of the FOB Delivery Window, Project Co has not berthed the LNG Tanker, and such delay is not attributable to a reason that would result in an extension of Allotted Laytime under Paragraph 8.2, Project Co shall be deemed to have failed to make the FOB SCQ of the relevant cargo available for delivery and the provisions of Clause 16.2 shall apply. 
 7.2 For each delivery window period, Project Co shall determine the berthing priority among LNG vessels which have tendered a valid Notice of Readiness before or during their scheduled delivery window as follows 
 7.2.1 The first berthing priority for a delivery window period shall be for an LNG vessel scheduled for such delivery window period. Priority within this group shall be given to the LNG vessel which has first tendered Project Co its valid Notice of Readiness. Once an LNG vessel achieves a first berthing priority pursuant to this Paragraph 7.2.1 or Paragraph 7.2.2, such LNG vessel shall maintain such priority until such LNG vessel is berthed, so long as its tendered Notice of Readiness remains valid and 
 7.2.2 The second berthing priority for a delivery window period shall be for an LNG vessel scheduled for arrival after such delivery window period. Priority within this group shall be given to the LNG vessel which has first tendered Project Co its valid Notice of Readiness. An LNG vessel with second berthing priority pursuant to this Paragraph 7.2.2. will achieve a first berthing priority on its scheduled delivery window pursuant to Paragraph 7.2.1 if such LNG vessel has not been berthed prior to such date, so long as its tendered Notice of Readiness remains valid. 
 96 

7.3 If an LNG Tanker tenders a valid Notice of Readiness after the end of its FOB Delivery Window, Project Co shall use reasonable efforts to berth such LNG Tanker as soon as reasonably practical provided, however, that, unless otherwise agreed with the Transporter, Project Co shall have no obligation to use such efforts to berth an LNG Tanker that tenders a Notice of Readiness more than seventy-two (72) hours after the end of its FOB Delivery Window. If, as of the seventy-second (72nd) hour after the end of the FOB Delivery Window, the LNG Tanker has not tendered a valid Notice of Readiness, and such delay is not attributable to a reason that would result in an extension of allowed berth time under Paragraph 10.2.2, the Transporter shall be deemed to have failed to take delivery of the FOB SCQ of the relevant cargo and the provisions of Clause 16.2.2 shall apply. 
 8. BERTH LAYTIME 
 8.1 The allotted laytime for each LNG Tanker Allotted Laytime shall be (i) for an LNG Tanker with an LNG cargo containment capacity of Cubic Meters or less, thirty-six (36) hours and (ii) for an LNG Tanker with an LNG cargo containment capacity of greater than Cubic Meters, according to the following formula 
 36 + x Allotted Laytime (in hours) 
 where 
 x y 12,000 Cubic Meters and 
 y the LNG cargo containment capacity of the LNG Tanker in excess of Cubic Meters). 
 8.2 Allotted Laytime shall be extended by any period of delay that is caused by 
 8.2.1 reasons attributable to the Transporter, a Governmental Authority, the LNG Tanker or its master, crew, owner or operator or any Third Party outside of the reasonable control of Project Co 
 8.2.2 force majeure or Adverse Weather Conditions 
 8.2.3 unscheduled curtailment or temporary discontinuation of operations at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) necessary for reasons of safety, except to the extent such unscheduled curtailment or temporary discontinuation of operations is due to Project Co s failure to operate and maintain its facilities as a Reasonable and Prudent Operator 
 8.2.4 time at berth during cool-down pursuant to Paragraphs 13.1.1 and 13.1.3 and 
 8.2.5 night-time transit restrictions. 
 8.3 The actual laytime for each LNG Tanker Actual Laytime shall commence when the Notice of Readiness is effective and shall end when (i) the LNG transfer and return lines of the LNG Tanker are disconnected from the Corpus Christi Facility s (or Alternate Production Facility s, as applicable) LNG transfer and return lines, (ii) the cargo documents are on board of the LNG Tanker and (iii) the LNG Tanker is cleared for departure and able to depart. 
 8.4 In the event Actual Laytime exceeds Allotted Laytime (including any extension in accordance with Paragraph 8.2) Demurrage Event ), Project Co shall pay to the Transporter as liquidated damages demurrage at the daily demurrage rate set forth in Section 7.13.3(a) of the DES SPA. If a Demurrage Event occurs, the Transporter shall invoice Project Co for such demurrage within one hundred eighty (180) Days of such event. 
 8.5 If an LNG Tanker is delayed in berthing at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) and or commencement of LNG transfer due to an event occurring at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) and for a reason that would not result in an extension of Allotted Laytime under Paragraph 8.2, and if, as a result thereof, the commencement of LNG transfer is delayed beyond twenty-four (24) hours after the Notice of Readiness is effective, then, for each full hour by which commencement of LNG transfer is delayed beyond such twenty-four (24) hour period, Project Co shall pay the Transporter as liquidated damages an amount, on account of excess boil-off, equal to the DES CSP applicable to such cargo, multiplied by a quantity 
 97 

equal to percent of the cargo containment capacity of the applicable LNG Tanker (in MMBtu), multiplied by the duration of the Demurrage Event (in hours). Transporter shall invoice Project Co for such excess boil-off within one hundred eighty (180) Days after the applicable event. 
 9. LNG TRANSFERS 
 9.1 Project Co shall cooperate with the Transporter (or its agents) and with the master of each LNG Tanker to facilitate the continuous and efficient transfer of LNG hereunder. 
 9.2 During LNG transfer, Project Co shall provide or take receipt of (as applicable), through the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) vapour return line, Gas in such quantities as are necessary for the safe transfer of LNG at such rates, pressures and temperatures as may be required by the design of the LNG Tanker. 
 9.3 Promptly after completion of loading of each cargo, Project Co shall send to Transporter a certificate of origin, together with such other documents concerning the cargo as may reasonably be requested by DES Buyer. 
 9.4 The Transporter, in cooperation with Project Co, shall cause the LNG Tanker to depart safely and expeditiously from the berth upon completion of LNG transfer. 
 10. LNG TANKER NOT READY FOR LNG TRANSFER EXCESS LAYTIME 
 10.1 If any LNG Tanker previously believed to be ready for LNG transfer is determined to be not ready after being berthed, the Notice of Readiness shall be invalid, and Project Co may direct the LNG Tanker s master to vacate the berth and proceed to anchorage, whether or not other LNG vessels are awaiting the berth, unless it appears reasonably certain to Project Co that such LNG Tanker can be made ready without disrupting the overall berthing schedule of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) or operations of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable). When an unready LNG Tanker at anchorage becomes ready for LNG transfer, its master shall notify Project Co. If, as a result of such LNG Tanker s not being ready to load, Transporter fails to take a cargo, the provisions of Paragraph 11.1.5(B) of Part B of Schedule 2 shall apply. 
 10.2 The following shall apply with respect to berthing 
 10.2.1 An LNG Tanker shall complete LNG transfer and vacate the berth as soon as possible but not later than the following allowed laytime 
 (A) twenty-four (24) hours from the time the LNG Tanker is all fast at the berth, in the case of an LNG Tanker with an LNG cargo containment capacity less than or equal to Cubic Meters or 
 (B) in accordance with the following formula, in the case of an LNG Tanker with an LNG cargo containment capacity greater than Cubic Meters 
 24 + x allowed laytime (in hours) 
 where 
 x y 12,000 Cubic Meters and 
 y the LNG cargo containment capacity of the LNG Tanker in excess of Cubic Meters. 
 10.2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the allowed laytime shall be extended for (i) reasons attributable to Project Co or the operator of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) (ii) reasons attributable to a Governmental Authority (iii) reasons attributable to any Third Party outside of the reasonable control of Project Co (iv) time at berth during any cool-down pursuant to Paragraph 13.1 (v) unscheduled curtailment or temporary discontinuation of operations at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) necessary for reasons of safety, except to the extent attributable to 
 98 

Project Co or the Transporter (vi) force majeure and (vii) night-time transit restrictions. 
 10.2.3 If an LNG Tanker fails to depart at the end of its allowed laytime (as extended pursuant to Paragraph 10.2.2), another LNG vessel is awaiting the berth and the LNG Tanker s continued occupancy of the berth will disrupt the overall berthing schedule of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) or operations of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable), Project Co may direct the LNG Tanker to vacate the berth and proceed to sea at utmost dispatch. 
 10.2.4 If an LNG Tanker fails to depart the berth at the end of its allowed laytime (as extended pursuant to Paragraph 10.2.2) and as a result the subsequent LNG vessel is prevented from or delayed in loading or unloading, the Transporter shall reimburse Project Co for any and all actual documented demurrage or excess boil-off that Project Co becomes contractually obligated to pay to any Third Party with respect to such subsequent LNG vessel, as a result of the LNG Tanker not completing LNG transfer and vacating the berth as required by this Paragraph 10.2 provided that the Transporter shall not be required to reimburse Project Co for any amounts based on a demurrage rate or excess boil-off rate or price in excess of the amounts specified in Paragraphs 8.4 and 8.5, as applicable. Project Co shall invoice Transporter for any amounts due under this Paragraph 10.2.4 within one hundred eighty (180) Days after the relevant FOB Delivery Window. 
 10.2.5 In the event an LNG Tanker fails to vacate the berth pursuant to this Paragraph 10 and Transporter is not taking actions to cause it to vacate the berth, Project Co may effect such removal at the expense of Transporter. 
 11. COOPERATION 
 11.1 If any circumstance occurs or is foreseen to occur so as to cause delay to an LNG Tanker or any other LNG vessel in berthing, loading, unloading or departing, the Transporter and Project Co shall, without prejudice to any other provision of this Agreement, discuss the problem in good faith with each other and, if appropriate, with other users of the Loading Port, and the Parties shall use reasonable efforts to minimise or to avoid the delay, and at the same time shall cooperate with each other and with such other users of the Loading Port, as appropriate, to find countermeasures to minimise or to avoid the occurrence of any similar delay in the future. 
 11.2 With respect to an LNG Tanker scheduled to load a cargo at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable), if such LNG Tanker is unable to berth at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) by the end of its FOB Delivery Window solely due to a force majeure event, then the relevant cargo shall be cancelled, to the extent affected provided, however, that if requested by Transporter, Project Co shall use reasonable efforts to change the FOB ADP or Ninety Day Schedule in order to maximise the safe, reliable and efficient usage of the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) and to assist the Transporter, or buyers having a firm contract to purchase LNG from the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) to load quantities of LNG which would otherwise have been loaded at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) during such cancelled FOB Delivery Windows or other affected delivery windows allocated to such buyers having a firm contract to purchase LNG from the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable). 
 12. OFF-SPEC LNG

 (A) Project Co shall give notice to the Transporter of the extent of the expected variance as soon as practicable (but in no case later than the commencement of loading of the cargo) 
 (B) the Transporter shall use reasonable efforts, including coordinating with DES Buyer the operator of the Receiving Terminal, to accept such LNG for delivery to DES Buyer where the LNG would be acceptable to the DES Buyer and the operator of the Receiving Terminal, each of them acting in their sole discretion, and would not prejudice the safe and reliable operation of any LNG Tanker, the Receiving Terminal, and any downstream facilities being supplied regasified LNG 
 (C) if the Transporter can accept delivery of such cargo, then the Transporter shall notify Project Co of the Transporter s estimate of the direct costs to be incurred by the Transporter, any Affiliate of the Transporter, and the operator of the Receiving Terminal in transporting and treating such Off-Spec FOB LNG (or to otherwise make such LNG marketable), and, to the extent Project Co agrees to such estimate, the Transporter shall take delivery of such cargo, and Project Co shall reimburse the Transporter for all reasonable documented direct costs incurred by the Transporter (including costs owed to any Affiliate of the Transporter, and the operator of the Receiving Terminal in transporting and treating such Off-Spec FOB LNG (or to otherwise make such LNG marketable) prior to and at the Receiving Terminal), provided, however, that Project Co s liability shall not exceed percent of the estimate notified by the Transporter and agreed by Project Co and 
 (D) if (1) the Transporter determines in good faith that it cannot, using reasonable efforts, receive such cargo, (2) Project Co rejects the cost estimate or (3) the Transporter anticipates that it might be liable for costs that would not otherwise be reimbursed pursuant to Paragraph 12.3.1(C), then the Transporter shall be entitled to reject such cargo by giving Project Co notice of rejection within seventy-two (72) hours of the Transporter s receipt of Project Co s notice pursuant to Paragraph 12.3.1(A). In the event the Transporter rejects a cargo under this Paragraph 12.3.1(D), Project Co shall be deemed to have failed to make 
 100 

available such cargo and Clause 16.2.1 shall apply. 
 12.3.2 If Off-Spec FOB LNG is delivered to the Transporter without the Transporter being made aware of the fact that such Off-Spec FOB LNG does not comply with the FOB Specifications, or without the Transporter being made aware of the actual extent to which such Off-Spec FOB LNG does not comply with the FOB Specifications, then 
 (A) if the Transporter is able, using reasonable efforts, to transport and treat the Off-Spec FOB LNG to meet the FOB Specifications (or to otherwise make such LNG marketable), then Project Co shall reimburse the Transporter for all reasonable documented direct costs incurred by the Transporter (including direct costs owed to any Affiliate of the Transporter and the operator of the Receiving Terminal in transporting and treating such Off-Spec FOB LNG received at the Receiving Terminal to meet the Specifications (or to otherwise make such LNG marketable)) or 
 (B) if the Transporter determines in good faith that it cannot, using reasonable efforts, transport and treat such Off-Spec FOB LNG to meet the Specifications (or to make such LNG marketable), then (i) the Transporter shall be entitled to reject such Off-Spec FOB LNG by giving Project Co notice of such rejection as soon as practicable, and in any case within ninety-six (96) hours after (A) Project Co notifies the Transporter in writing that such LNG is Off-Spec FOB LNG and the actual extent to which such Off-Spec FOB LNG does not comply with the FOB Specifications or (B) the Transporter becomes aware that such LNG is Off-Spec FOB LNG, whichever occurs first (ii) the Transporter shall be entitled to dispose of the loaded portion of such Off-Spec FOB LNG (or regasified LNG produced therefrom) in any manner that the Transporter, acting in accordance with the standards of a Reasonable and Prudent Operator, deems appropriate and (iii) Project Co shall reimburse the Transporter in respect of and indemnify and hold the Transporter harmless from all direct loss, damage, costs and expenses incurred by the Transporter as a result of the delivery of such Off-Spec FOB LNG, including in connection with the handling, treatment or safe disposal of such Off-Spec FOB LNG or other LNG being held at the Receiving Terminal or being carried onboard the LNG Tanker which was contaminated by it, cleaning or clearing the LNG Tanker and Receiving Terminal, and damage caused to the LNG Tanker and Receiving Terminal. In the event the Transporter rejects a cargo under this Paragraph 12.3.2(B), Project Co shall be deemed to have failed to make available such cargo and Clause 16.2.1 shall apply. 
 13. COOL-DOWN AND GAS-UP OF LNG TANKERS 
 13.1 The Transporter shall be solely responsible for ensuring that each LNG Tanker elected by the Transporter for taking a cargo arrives at the Corpus Christi Facility (or Alternate Production Facility, as applicable) cold and in a state of readiness.

 8. Samples for Quality Analysis 
 a) General . Representative liquid samples shall be collected from an appropriate point located as close as practical to the loading line starting one (1) hour after full loading rate is reached and ending one (1) hour before ramping down from the full loading rate. 
 Sampling conducted by Project Co will conform with the procedure specified in (i), (ii) or (iii) as follows 
 i) Online chromatograph A sample shall be taken and analyzed at least once every twenty (20) minutes by an on-line chromatograph during the sampling period referenced in the opening paragraph of section 8(a) of this Exhibit A. These intermittent samples will be passed through a vaporizer, and samples of the vaporized liquid will be analyzed. The arithmetically averaged analysis, representative of the delivered LNG cargo shall be used for all appropriate calculations. Samples taken when biphasic or where overheated LNG is suspected to be in the main transfer line will be disregarded. 
 In instances where the on-line chromatograph system being utilized were to fail during loading operations manual samples (composite or spot) collected shall be analyzed. 
 ii) Composite sample One (1) representative sample of the loading shall be collected by continuous sampling of the delivered LNG. If applicable the sample analysis shall be applied to the appropriate calculations associated with the delivered LNG cargo. 
 iii) Spot samples One (1) spot sample shall be collected from the vaporizer at each point in time corresponding to approximately twenty-five percent (25 ), fifty percent (50 and seventy-five percent (75 of loading is completed. If applicable the analysis of spot samples shall be conducted, averaged and applied to the appropriate calculations associated with the delivered LNG cargo. 
 b) Manual Samples . It is recognized that for every loading manual samples should be retained for use by the Transporter and Project Co. 
 i) Where sampling analysis is conducted using spot samples per section 8(a)iii of this Exhibit A, two (2) sets of samples shall be collected from the vaporizer at each point in time corresponding to approximately twenty-five percent (25 ), fifty percent (50 and seventy-five percent (75 of loading is completed and retained. 
 110 

ii) Where sampling analysis is conducted using a composite sample per section 8(a)ii of this Exhibit A, two (2) samples shall be collected from the collection devices at the end of loading and retained. 
 The samples collected shall be properly labeled and sealed by the independent surveyor in attendance. Project Co shall retain all samples for a period of thirty (30) Days, unless the analysis is disputed prior to the end of such thirty (30) Day period.

 9. Quality Analysis 
 a) Certification and Deviation . Chromatograph calibration gasses shall be provided and their composition certified by an independent third party. From time to time, deviation checks shall be performed to verify the accuracy of the gas composition mole percentages and resulting calculated physical properties. Analyses of a sample of test gas of known composition resulting when procedures that are in accordance with the above mentioned standards have been applied will be considered as acceptable if the resulting calculated gross heating value is within plus or minus zero point three percent 0. 3 of the known gross heating value of the test gas sample. If the deviation exceeds the tolerance stated, the gross real heating value, relative density and compressibility previously calculated will be corrected immediately. Previous analyses will be corrected to the point where the error occurred, if this can be positively identified to the satisfaction of both Parties. Otherwise it shall be assumed that the drift has been linear since the last recalibration and correction shall be based on this assumption. 
 b) GPA Standard 2261 . All samples shall be analyzed by Project Co to determine the molar fraction of the hydrocarbon and other components in the sample by gas chromatography using a mutually agreed method in accordance with GPA Standard 2261 - Method of Analysis for Gas and Similar Gaseous Mixtures by Gas Chromatography, current as of January 1 st , 1990 and as periodically updated or as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties. If better standards for analysis are subsequently adopted by GPA or other recognized competent impartial authority, upon mutual agreement of the Transporter and Project Co, they shall be substituted for the standard then in use, but such substitution shall not take place retroactively. A calibration of the chromatograph or other analytical instrument used shall be performed by Project Co immediately prior to the analysis of the sample of LNG delivered. Project Co shall give advance notice to the Transporter of the time Project Co intends to conduct a calibration thereof, and the Transporter shall have the right to have a representative present at each such calibration provided, however, Project Co will not be obligated to defer or reschedule any calibration in order to permit the representative of the Transporter to be present. 
 c) GPA Standard 2377 . Project Co shall determine the presence of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) by use of GPA Standard 2377 Test of Hydrogen Sulfide and Carbon Dioxide in Gas Using Length of Stain Tubes. Total sulfur will be determined as the summation of sulfur compounds (i.e. mercaptans) following ASTM D1988-06 (Standard Test Method for Mercaptans in Natural Gas using Length-of-Stain Detector Tubes). If the presence of Hydrogen Sulfide or sulfur compounds is detected, an additional test shall be performed to confirm the respective concentration(s) following either (i) ASTM D6228 (Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by Gas Chromatography and Flame Photometric Detection), (ii) ASTM D5504 (Determination of Sulfur 
 111 

Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence), (iii) ASTM D6667 (Determination of Total Volatile Sulfur in Gaseous Hydrocarbons and Liquefied Petroleum Gases by Ultraviolet Fluorescence), or (iv) any other testing method mutually agreed by the Parties. 
 10. Operating Procedures 
 a) Notice . Prior to conducting operations for measurement, gauging, sampling and analysis provided in this Exhibit A, the Party responsible for such operations shall notify the appropriate representatives of the other Party, allowing such representatives reasonable opportunity to be present for all operations and computations provided that the absence of the other Party s representative after notification and opportunity to attend shall not prevent any operations and computations from being performed. 
 b) Independent Surveyor . At the request of either Party any measurement, gauging, sampling and analysis shall be witnessed and verified by an independent surveyor mutually agreed upon by the Transporter and Project Co. The results of such surveyor s verifications shall be made available promptly to each Party. 
 c) Preservation of Records . All records of measurement and the computed results shall be preserved by the Party responsible for taking the same, or causing the same to be taken, and made available to the other Party for a period of not less than three (3) years after such measurement and computation. 
 11. Quantities Delivered 
 a) Calculation of MMBtu Quantities . Project Co shall calculate, or cause to be calculated and the Transporter shall verify, the quantity of MMBtu delivered. Either Party may, at its own expense, require the measurements and calculations and or their verification by an independent surveyor, mutually agreed upon by the Parties. Consent to an independent surveyor proposed by a Party shall not be unreasonably withheld by the other Party. 
 b) Determination of Gross Heating Value . All component values shall be in accordance with the latest revision of GPA Standard 2145 SI (2009) - Physical Constants for Hydrocarbons & Other Compounds of Interest to the Natural Gas Industry and the latest revision of the reference standards therein. Standard reference conditions for Hi component should be 15 C & 101.325 kPa. 
 c) Determination of Volume of LNG Loaded . 
 (i) The LNG volume in the tanks of the LNG Tanker before and after loading (valves have to be closed) shall be determined by gauging on the basis of the tank gauge tables provided for in Paragraph 6. During the period when measurement is occurring, no LNG cargo, ballast, boil-off gas, fuel oil or other cargo transfer activity will be carried out on the LNG Tanker. Measurements shall first be made immediately before loading commences. Accordingly, after connection of the loading arms, but prior to their cool-down, and immediately before opening the manifold ESD valves of the LNG Tanker, the initial gauging shall be conducted upon the confirmation of stoppage of all spray pumps and compressors and shut-off of the gas master valve to the LNG Tanker s boilers or any other gas consuming unit. The gas master valve to the LNG Tanker s boilers or any other gas consuming unit shall remain closed until after the second gauging, unless a regulatory change requires the consumption of gas during the vessel loading operations and or upon mutual agreement between all parties upon which event the procedure for the measurement of gas consumed during loading shall be calculated in accordance with Paragraph 12.4 of this Exhibit A. A second gauging shall be made immediately after loading is completed. Accordingly, the second gauging shall be conducted upon the confirmation of shut-off of the manifold ESD valves, with transfer pumps off and allowing sufficient time for the liquid level to stabilize. Measurements prior to loading and after loading will be carried out based on the condition of the LNG Tanker s lines upon arrival at berth. Since significant volumes of LNG may remain in the LNG Tanker s manifold and crossover, gauging will be performed with these lines in the same condition prior to loading and after loading. If the LNG Tanker s manifold and crossover lines are empty (warm) when 
 112 

measurement is taken before loading commences, they will be emptied prior to measurement following the completion of loading. If the crossover lines are liquid filled (cold) when measurement is taken before loading commences, they will remain full (cold) until measurement is taken following the completion of loading. The volume of LNG remaining in the tanks immediately before loading of the LNG Tanker shall be subtracted from the volume immediately after loading and the resulting volume shall be taken as the volume of the LNG delivered from the terminal to the LNG Tanker. 
 The volume of LNG stated in cubic meters to the nearest zero point zero zero one (0.001) cubic meter, shall be determined by using the tank gauge tables and by applying the volume corrections set forth therein. 
 (ii) Gas returned to the terminal and gas consumed by the LNG Tanker during loading shall be taken into account to determine the volume loaded for the Transporter s account in accordance with the formula in Paragraph 12.4 of this Exhibit A MMBtu Calculation of the Quantity of LNG Loaded. 
 (iii) If failure of the primary gauging and measuring devices of an LNG Tanker should make it impossible to determine the LNG volume, the volume of LNG loaded shall be determined by gauging the liquid level using the secondary gauging and measurement devices. If an LNG Tanker is not so equipped, the volume of LNG loaded shall be determined by gauging the liquid level in Project Co s onshore LNG storage tanks immediately before and after loading the LNG Tanker, in line with the terminal procedures, and such volume shall have subtracted from it an estimated LNG volume, agreed upon by the Parties, for boil-off from such tanks during the loading of such LNG Tanker. Project Co shall provide the Transporter, or cause the Transporter to be provided with, a certified copy of tank gauge tables for each onshore LNG tank which is to be used for this purpose, such tables to be verified by a competent impartial authority.

 12.4 MMBtu Calculation of the Quantity of LNG Loaded 
 The number of MMBtu contained in the LNG loaded shall be calculated using the following formula 
 
 The derivation of the conversion factor 1 1055.12 in the formula in this Paragraph for the conversion of MJ into MMBtu is obtained from GPA-2145 1994 and IP-251 1976 as follows 
 (a) q(T,P) means the gross heating value (measured at temperature T and pressure P), contained in a given quantity of gas 
 (b) q(60 F, 14.696 psia) in MJ 1 1.00006 x q(15 C, 1013.25 millibar) in MJ 
 (c) 1 MMBtu corresponds to 1055.06 MJ 
 (d) q(60 F, 14.696 psia) in MMBtu 1 1055.06 x q(60 F, 14.696 psia) in MJ and 
 (e) Combining (b) and (d) above yields 
 q(60 F, 14.696 psia) in MMBtu 1 1055.12 x q(15 C, 1013.25 millibar) in MJ. 
 Hence the number of MJ derived shall be divided by 1055.12 to obtain the number of MMBtu for invoicing purposes. 
 QBOG the quantity of boil off gas in MJ consumed by the LNG tanker during loading, calculated as follows 
 QBOG (V2 x 55.575) 
 where

 Quantity of Natural Gas Consumed by LNG Tanker (V2) 
 The quantity of natural gas consumed by the LNG tanker during loading shall be computed by taking the initial and the final reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter on board the 
 115 

tanker (i.e. final reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter after completion of loading minus initial reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter before the start of loading) and is calculated by using the following formula 
 V2 Vf Vi 
 where 
 V2 the quantity of natural gas consumed by the LNG tanker during loading, stated in kg 
 Vf the reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter on board the tanker after the completion of loading, stated in kg and 
 Vi the reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter on board the tanker before the start of loading, stated in kg. 
 12.5 Calculation of Gross Heating Value (Volume Based) 
 The calculation of the Gross Heating Value (volume based) in Btu SCF shall be derived from the same compositional analysis as is used for the purposes of calculating the Gross Heating Value (mass based) Hm and the following formula shall apply 
 
 The derivation of the conversion factor 1.13285 for the conversion of MJ kmol into Btu SCF is obtained as follows 
 (a) molar gross heating value (Xi x Mi x Hi) MJ kmol 
 (b) 1 kmol 2.20462 lbmol 
 (c) 1 lbmol 379.482 SCF 
 (d) hence 1 kmol 836.614 SCF and 
 (e) Hv 1,000,000 (1055.12 x 836.614) x (Xi x Mi x Hi) Btu SCF
