USE OF NAMES AND CURRENCY 
 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms we , us , our , Company , or Planet 13 refer to Planet 13 Holdings Inc. together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
 
 Unless otherwise indicated, all references to , US or USD in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to United States dollars, and all references to C , CAD , or CAD refer to Canadian dollars. 
 
 IMPLICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY 
 
 As a company with less than 1.235 billion in revenue during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to as the Securities Act , as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act . As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other exemptions from requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These provisions include: 

Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 

Exemptions from non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute; and 

Exemption from auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. 

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the year in which we have total annual gross revenue of 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of the common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act.

 (b) Contingencies 
 
 The Company s operations are subject to a variety of local and state regulations. Failure to comply with one or more of those regulations could result in fines, restrictions on its operations, or losses of permits that could result in the Company ceasing operations. While management of the Company believes that the Company is in compliance with applicable local and state regulations at September 30, 2024 , medical and adult use cannabis regulations continue to evolve and are subject to differing interpretations. As a result, the Company may be subject to regulatory fines, penalties, or restrictions in the future. 
 
 (c) Claims and Litigation 
 
 From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of business. At September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , there were no pending or threatened lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results of the Company s operations. There are also no proceedings in which any of the Company s directors, officers or affiliates is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to the Company s interest. 
 
 (d) Operating Licenses 
 
 Although the possession, cultivation, and distribution of marijuana for medical and adult use is permitted in Nevada and California, and for medical use these activities are permitted in Florida, marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance and its use remains a violation of federal law. Since federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana pre-empts state laws that legalize its use, strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the Company s inability to proceed with our business plans. In addition, the Company s assets, including real property, cash, equipment, and other goods, could be subject to asset forfeiture because marijuana is still federally illegal. 

Liquidity risk 
 
 The Company s approach to managing risk is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company s financial liabilities consist of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, obligations under operating leases, notes payable and taxes. The Company manages liquidity risk by reviewing its capital requirements on an ongoing basis. Historically, the Company s main source of funding has been the public issuance of common equity. The Company s access to financing is always uncertain. There can be no assurance of continued access to significant equity financing. 
 
 Concentration risk 
 
 The Company operates exclusively in Southern Nevada, Florida, and California and has a small presence in Illinois. Should economic conditions deteriorate within any of these regions, its results of operations and financial position would be negatively impacted. 
 
 Banking risk 
 Notwithstanding that a majority of states have legalized medical marijuana, there has been no change in US federal banking laws related to the deposit and holding of funds derived from activities related to the cannabis industry. Given that US federal law provides that the production and possession of cannabis is illegal, there is a strong argument that banks cannot accept or deposit funds from businesses involved with the marijuana industry. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have difficulty accessing the US banking system and traditional financing sources. The inability to open bank accounts with certain institutions may make it difficult to operate the business of the Company and leave the Company s cash holdings vulnerable. 
 
 Asset forfeiture risk 
 
 Because the cannabis industry remains illegal under US federal law, any property owned by participants in the cannabis industry which are either used in the course of conducting such business, or are the proceeds of such business, could be subject to seizure by law enforcement and subsequent civil asset forfeiture. Even if the owner of the property was never charged with a crime, the property in question could still be seized and subject to an administrative proceeding by which with minimal due process, it could be subject to forfeiture.

million of the Company s funds held at WAB (the WAB Funds and managed by El Capitan to be directed to the Orange County, California Sheriff s Office (the Sheriff s Office on September 21, 2023. The 5.4 million has been recorded as restricted cash as at December 31, 2023. 
 
 On or around October 24, 2023, the Company became aware of the levy against the WAB Funds and thereafter filed a third -party claim (the WAB Claim of exemption asserting rightful ownership over the WAB Funds. 
 
 The Company has secured a partial settlement with Casa Verde for the release of million of the WAB Funds, which the Company received on January 31, 2024. The remaining approximately million of the WAB Funds (the Remaining Levied Funds is still in the possession of the Sheriff s Office while litigation is ongoing. The Company has not relinquished any right to the Remaining Levied Funds and continues to pursue their return. A hearing on the ultimate disposition of the Remaining Levied Funds is pending. 
 
 After filing the WAB Claim in November 2023, the Company also took immediate action to withdraw the remaining approximately million that the Company held in two additional Company accounts managed by El Capitan (the Additional Funds ). El Capitan has refused to honor the Company s further withdrawal requests with respect to the Additional Funds and at this time it is unclear whether the Additional Funds will be returned. Based on discussions with El Capitan to secure the withdrawal of the Additional Funds and purported bank statements provided by El Capitan, the Company has reason to believe that the Additional Funds were misappropriated by El Capitan. 
 
 On January 22, 2024, the Company initiated a lawsuit in Santa Monica, California against El Capitan, El Capitan s founder and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Nash, Casa Verde, Casa Verde s Managing Member Karan Wadhera, and Jamie Nash, the spouse of Andrew Nash (collectively, the Defendants seeking approximately 16.5 million in compensatory damages and other relief. The Company alleges that each Defendant is liable for their involvement in a scheme to defraud the Company of funds managed by El Capitan in its capacity as the Company s fiduciary.

We experienced an increase in net revenue of 29.7 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase of 14.0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of VidaCann that closed on May 10, 2024. The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include four months and 21 days of VidaCann operations that were not owned by the Company in the prior year period. The addition of revenue from the VidaCann operations more than offset the reduction in the number of customers and size of the average ticket at our Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore location compared to the prior year periods. Wholesale revenue in California and Nevada decreased by 1,164,380 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased by 2,895,244 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year periods. Overall, net revenue increased by 7,370,831 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and revenue increased by 10,588,448 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We believe that increased in inflation, including the increase in the price of gasoline and the increase in interest rates up to the first interest rate cut in three years on September 18, 2024, combined to reduce the disposable income of our customers during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and also had an impact on the number of customers and tourists visiting the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore and our other retail locations during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year periods. These declines were more than offset by the inclusion of the VidaCann operations.

Gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 51.9 compared to 44.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and was 49.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 44.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a result of a decrease in retail sales incentives during the period and a reduction in the level of wholesale revenue, both from our Nevada and California wholesale operations, that have an inherently lower gross margin than retail sales revenue. 
 
 The costs of internal cultivation have continued to trend down as we continue to improve our yields and cultivation efficiency across all of our cultivation facilities. In addition, margin enhancement through the creation of internally generated brands, such as TRENDI, HaHa Gummies, Dreamland Chocolate, HaHa Beverages and Medizin, that were sold in our own stores continued to have a positive impact on gross margins during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, helping to partially offset the lower margins received on the sale of wholesale product and sales to local customers in the State of Nevada. Margins on retail sales from the 21 weeks of VidaCann operations also had a positive impact on the overall level of gross margins. We anticipate that margins will trend upward as tourist customers return to Las Vegas and the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore in greater numbers and through our ability to produce our award-winning brands in California and introduce those brands into our Planet 13 OC store and across the Florida store network. 
 
 Our premium cultivation facilities in Nevada and California were operating near capacity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The amount of cannabis grown during the period increased when compared to the prior year period due to higher yields across all of our cultivation facilities during the period. The wholesale flower market in California continues to stabilize, and we have seen increases in both demand and the price received for premium indoor-grown flower during the three and nine months that ended September 30, 2024. The VidaCann cultivation operations were also operating at or near capacity during the four months that they were owned by Planet 13. Seasonality in the product quality of greenhouse-grown flower during the June to September period, especially in houses that have not yet been optimized, led to decreased consumer demand for our products in the Florida market during the period we owned the VidaCann operations. Improvements through the addition of HVAC, Dehumidification, upgraded lighting, and irrigation systems are already having a positive impact on product quality, and we expect that this will remove the seasonal variability in product quality going forward. Our plan includes upgrading all the greenhouses to this new standard. This should increase the availability of premium flower and other products across the Florida store network.

Non-cash, share-based compensation of 25,416 was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreasing from 602,977 that was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-cash, share-based compensation expense of 154,893 was recognized compared to 1,926,595 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is attributable to the vesting schedule for both Restricted Share Units RSUs and incentive stock options that were previously granted, particularly the net 3,954,213 RSUs that were granted on April 18, 2021, that vested 1/3 on December 1, 2021 and 1/3 on December 1, 2022, and 1/3 on December 1, 2023. Compared to the 485,185 RSUs granted on March 22, 2024, of which 185,185 vested immediately. These amounts are non-cash, and the expense is recognized in accordance with the vesting schedule of the underlying stock options and RSUs. See Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for additional details on the assumptions used to calculate fair value as well as information regarding the vesting of the various components of the non-cash share-based compensation. 
 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 16.6 or 224,283 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, (increased by 9.1 or 364,423 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023). The increase was a result of us continuing to refine our marketing efforts to optimize marketing spend on initiatives that drive increased customer traffic to the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, the Planet 13 OC Superstore, and the Medizin dispensary in Nevada as well as the addition of sales and marketing activities related to our Florida operations.

 Depreciation and amortization increased by 19.8 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the prior year period (increased 6.0 during the nine-month period) as a result of the acquisition of VidaCann. 
 
 We recorded an impairment loss of 2,393,087 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023) related to the write-down to net realizable value of construction in process assets for a steel building kit structure at our Florida operations that is no longer going to be used in the operations. 
 
 Interest income, net was 30,263 incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to interest income, net of 10,834 incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023 (interest income, net was 139,405 and 159,728 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively). Interest income relates to interest earned on cash deposits held by the Company. Interest expense is related to accrued interest on our long-term debt that is due and payable on demand. The balance of long-term debt as of September 30, 2024, was 10,331,632 compared to 884,000 as of December 31, 2023. The increase in long-term debt is due to the 5,000,000 vendor noted owed on the VidaCann acquisition that is due April 1, 2025, approximately 2,947,632 in bank indebtedness at the VidaCann operations that matures in February 2025 and 1,500,000 million in notes due to related parties at VidaCann that matures May 10, 2029. 

We conduct our operations in both United States dollars and Canadian dollars, holding financial assets and incurring expenses in both currencies, and holding all of our currency in US Dollars. The foreign currency gains/losses reflect fluctuations in the underlying exchange rates on the dates expenses are incurred compared to when they are paid. It is our policy not to hedge our CAD exposure. 
 
 Warrants are accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative accounting guidance in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ASC 815 ), as derivative liabilities based on the specific terms of the warrant agreements. Liability-classified instruments are recorded at fair value at each reporting period with any change in fair value recognized as a component of change in fair value of derivative liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Transaction costs allocated to warrants that are presented as a liability are expensed immediately within other expenses (income) in the statements of net loss and comprehensive loss. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in fair value of the warrants resulted in a gain of 0 (gain of 18,127 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023). 
 
 Other income (expense), consisting of a loss on transaction costs relating to the sale of Planet 13 Florida, Automated Teller Machine ATM fees, and other miscellaneous income/expense was income of 376,717 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other income consisting of a gain on Employee Retention Credits, ATM fees, and other miscellaneous income/expense of 98,861 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 4,490,659 compared to 2,365,207 for the prior year period. Income tax expense was 10,885,563 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7,561,151 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The tax expense increased due to the increase in taxable profitability during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. We are subject to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ), which prohibits businesses from taking deductions or credits in carrying on any trade or business consisting of trafficking in certain controlled substances that are prohibited by federal law. We, to the extent our trafficking activities, and/or key contract counterparties directly engaged in trafficking in cannabis, have incurred significant tax liabilities from the application of Section 280E. Our income tax obligations under Section 280E of the Code are typically substantially higher as compared to companies to which Section 280E does not apply. Section 280E essentially requires us to pay federal, and as applicable, state income taxes on gross profit, which presents a significant financial burden that increases our net loss and may make it more difficult for us to generate net profit and cash flow from operations in future periods. In addition, to the extent that the application of Section 280E creates a financial burden on contract counterparties, such burdens may impact the ability of such counterparties to make full or timely payment to us, which would also have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 The overall net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 7,411,190 (( 0.02) per share) compared to an overall net loss of 46,254,236 (( 0.21) per share) for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 6,642,779 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in operating activities of 11,187,083 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. A significant portion of the increase in cash provided by operating activities is directly attributable to the net change in certain working capital items during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 1,236,623 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in investing activities of 6,844,554 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a result of the net cash received after factoring in the sale of Planet 13 Florida during the period that more than offset the cash used on the purchase of property and equipment during the period. No such cash inflow occurred during the prior year period. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 6,773,923 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 267,526 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was a result of the net cash proceeds received on the closing of an equity financing in March 2024 offset by cash used in the acquisition of VidaCann. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 We have a recent history of operating losses. It may be necessary for us to arrange for additional financing to meet our ongoing growth initiatives. 
 
 Management believes it will be able to raise equity capital as required in the long term, but recognizes the risks attached thereto. There can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that the terms of such financing may be favorable. 
 
 Should financing not be available, the Company has adequate liquidity in the form of cash on hand to fund all of its planned capital expenditures and expansion plans as well as to continue to fund its operation over the next 12 months, including the planned build-out of its operations in Florida and the continuing build-out of its Illinois retail location.

Table of Contents 

Capital Management 
 
 Our capital consists of shareholders equity. Our objective when managing capital is to maintain adequate levels of funding to support the development of our businesses and maintain the necessary corporate and administrative functions to facilitate these activities. This is done primarily through equity financing. Future financings are dependent on market conditions and there can be no assurance we will be able to raise funds in the future. We invest all capital that is surplus to our immediate operational needs in short-term, highly liquid, and high-grade financial instruments. There were no changes to our approach to capital management during the period. We are not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024, or as of December 31, 2023, or as of the date hereof. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on management s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. 
 
 Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. 
 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 There have been no material changes to our market risk disclosures as set forth in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers co-CEOs and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the risk related to controls and procedures. 
 
 In connection with the preparation of this Form 10-Q, as of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the co-CEOs and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 In the three months ending September 30, 2024, management completed the remediation of a previously identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Otherwise, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control performed during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 On January 22, 2024, the Company initiated a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court in Santa Monica, California against El Capitan, El Capitan s founder and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Nash, Casa Verde, Casa Verde s Managing Member Karan Wadhera, and Jamie Nash, the spouse of Andrew Nash (collectively, the Defendants seeking approximately 16.5 million in compensatory damages and other relief, including the recovery of fees and costs associated with the legal proceedings. The Company alleges that each Defendant is liable for their involvement in a scheme to defraud the Company of funds managed by El Capitan in its capacity as the Company s fiduciary. The Company will continue to vigorously pursue its rights to reclaim the funds that it entrusted to El Capitan and will pursue recovery of its funds through all legally available means, including as appropriate, through cooperation with law enforcement. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 In addition to the risk factor set forth below and other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, financial results, or future performance. Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Implications of being a smaller reporting company 
 
 Based on our public float, as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, we determined that we qualify as a smaller reporting company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. 
 
 Smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosure and have certain other reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, with correspondingly reduced Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and not being required to furnish a stock performance graph in our annual report. 
 
 We may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on certain or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 The Company made no unregistered sales of securities during the quarter covered by this report that have not previously been disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
