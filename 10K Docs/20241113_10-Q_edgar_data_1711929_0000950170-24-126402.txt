 consolidated real estate properties, single-family rental units, two investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures and real estate debt investment. The Company currently operates in reportable segments: Multifamily, Single-Family Rental, Industrial, Office, Self-Storage, Other, and Investments in Real Estate Debt. Financial results by segment are reported in Note 15. On December 27, 2017, the Company commenced its initial public offering of up to billion in shares of common stock. On June 2, 2021, the initial public offering terminated and the Company commenced a follow-on public offering of up to billion in shares of common stock. On August 10, 2022, the follow-on public offering terminated and the Company commenced its third public offering of up to billion in shares of common stock, consisting of up to billion in shares in its primary offering and up to billion in shares pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had received aggregate net proce eds of billion from the sale of shares of its common stock through its public offerings. In April 2024, the Company launched a program (the DST Program to raise capital, through its Operating Partnership, thr ough private placement offerings exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), by selling beneficial interests in specific Delaware statutory trusts DSTs holding real properties (the DST Properties ). As of September 30, 2024, the Company has raised approximately million in gross offering proceeds through the DST Program.

properties through the DST Program and the total investments in real estate, net associated with the DST Properties was million. There were properties held through the DST Program as of December 31, 2023. The Company has determined that the DST entities are VIEs. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. As a result, these DST entities are included in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, the total liabilities of the Company s consolidated VIEs, excluding the Operating Partnership, were billion. Such amounts are included on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. There were assets of the Company s consolidated VIEs as of September 30, 2024, due to certain intercompany eliminations upon consolidation. There were assets or liabilities in the consolidated VIEs, excluding the Operating Partnership, as of December 31, 2023. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

million and million, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did t record unrealized gains or losses on its investments in real estate debt securities as the securities portfolio was completely disposed of by June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded net unrealized gains on its investments in real estate debt securities of million. Such amounts are recorded as a component of Income from investments in real estate debt, net on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company s derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value. The Company s interest rate swap agreements are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the forward interest rate curve adjusted for the Company s non-performance risk. The Company s interest rate cap positions are valued using models developed by the respective counterparty as well as third party pricing service providers that use as their basis readily observable market parameters (such as forward yield curves and credit default swap data). The fair values of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts are determined by comparing the contracted forward exchange rate to the current market exchange rate. The current market exchange rates are determined by using market spot rates, forward rates and interest rate curves for the underlying instruments. The fair values of the Company s financial instruments (other than investments in real estate debt, mortgage notes, credit facility, unsecured line of credit and derivative instruments), including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and other financial instruments, approximate their carrying or contract value. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model to value its loans secured by real estate (considering loan features, credit quality of the loans and includes a review of market yield data, collateral asset performance, local and macro real estate performance, capital market conditions, debt yield, loan-to-value ratios, borrower financial condition and performance, among other factors). The Company continuously monitors and assesses the credit quality of individual loans including the review of delinquency and loan-to-value ratios on its loans secured by real estate. Such loans have floating interest rates with market terms and there are no underlying credit quality issues as of September 30, 2024.

Valuation of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis Certain of the Company s assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments, such as when there is evidence of impairment, and therefore measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The Company reviews its real estate properties for impairment each quarter or when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impaired value. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a million impairment charge on hospitality property. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an aggregate of million of impairment charges on hospitality properties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an aggregate of million of impairment charges related predominantly to single-family rental properties and, to a lesser extent, two hospitality properties. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the Company s remaining impaired assets was million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company s remaining impaired assets was million and million, respectively. The estimated fair values of the impaired properties held as of September 30, 2024, were primarily based on recently completed sales transactions, letters of intent, or non-binding purchase and sales contracts. These inputs are considered Level 2 inputs for purposes of the fair value hierarchy. There are inherent uncertainties in making these estimates such as current and future macroeconomic conditions. Valuation of liabilities not measured at fair value Fair value of the Company s indebtedness is estimated by modeling the cash flows required by the Company s debt agreements and discounting them back to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. Additionally, the Company considers current market rates and conditions by evaluating similar borrowing agreements with comparable loan-to-value ratios and credit profiles. The inputs used in determining the fair value of the Company s indebtedness are considered Level 3. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Company s mortgage notes, secured credit facilities and secured financings on investments in real estate debt was approximately million below the outstanding principal balance. 
 of its REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in a taxable year, without the benefit of certain relief provisions, it will be subject to federal and state income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may also be subject to certain federal, state, local, and foreign taxes on its income and assets, including (i) taxes on any undistributed income, (ii) taxes related to its taxable REIT subsidiaries TRSs and (iii) certain state or local income taxes. The Company and the Operating Partnership s tax returns for three years from the date filed are subject to examination.

While it is uncertain whether the United States will enact legislation to adopt Pillar 2, certain foreign jurisdictions where the Company owns real estate assets has adopted legislation. The Company does not expect Pillar 2 to have a material impact on the Company s effective tax rate or the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of million and million, respectively, within Other expense, net in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized income tax expense of million and million, respectively, within Other expense, net in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a net deferred tax liability of million and million, respectively, primarily due to assumed capital gains from two European investments, within Other liabilities on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023, net operating loss NOL carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes tot aled mill ion, and are primarily driven by dispositions of residential rental units within one of the Company s TRSs. Although the federal NOL carryforwards do not expire, the Company has recorded full valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets for which the Company believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize a benefit from these in future taxable years.

Share Repurchases The Company has adopted a share repurchase plan whereby, subject to certain limitations, stockholders may request on a monthly basis that the Company repurchases all or any portion of their shares. Should repurchase requests, in the Company s judgment, place an undue burden on its liquidity, adversely affect its operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company as a whole, or should the Company otherwise determine that investing its liquid assets in real properties or other illiquid investments rather than repurchasing its shares is in the best interests of the Company as a whole, then the Company may choose to repurchase fewer shares than have been requested to be repurchased, or none at all. Further, the Company s board of directors may modify or suspend the Company s share repurchase plan if it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and in the best interest of its stockholders. In addition, the total amount of shares th at the Company may repurchase is limited. From the Company s inception until its share repurchase plan was amended as described below, the total amount of shares that the Company could repurchase was limited, in any calendar month, to shares whose aggregate value (based on the repurchase price per share on the date of the repurchase) was no more than of its aggregate net asset value NAV per month (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding month) and no more than of its aggregate NAV per calendar quarter (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter). In the event that the Company determines to repurchase some but not all of the shares submitted for repurchase during any month, shares re purchased at the end of the month will be repurchased on a pro rata basis. On May 23, 2024, the Company amended its share repurchase plan such that, beginning with repurchases during the month of May 2024, the Company limits share repurchases to of NAV per month (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding month) and, beginning on July 1, 2024, the Company limits share repurchases to of NAV per quarter (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased million shares of common stock, representing a total of million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased million shares of common stock, representing a total of million.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased million shares of common stock, representing a total of billion.

Redeemable Non-controlling Interests In connection with its performance participation interest, the Special Limited Partner holds Class I units in the Operating Partnership. See Note 12 for further details of the Special Limited Partner s performance participation interest. Because the Special Limited Partner has the ability to redeem its Class I units for cash, at its election, the Company has classified these Class I units as Redeemable non-controlling interest in mezzanine equity on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The redeemable non-controlling interest is recorded at the greater of the carrying amount, adjusted for its share of the allocation of income or loss and distributions, or the redemption value, which is equivalent to fair value, of such units at the end of each measurement period. In addition to the Special Limited Partner s interest noted above, certain third parties also have a redeemable non-controlling interest.

Under the Operating Partnership s limited partnership agreement, the annual total return will be allocated solely to the Special Limited Partner after the other unit holders have received a total return of (after recouping any loss carryforward amount) and such allocation will continue until the allocation between the Special Limited Partner and all other unit holders is equal to and , respectively. Thereafter, the Special Limited Partner will receive an allocation of 12.5 of the annual total return.

ITEM 2.	MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 References herein to Starwood Real Estate Income Trust, Inc., Company, we, us, or our refer to Starwood Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those in this discussion as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024 and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We do not undertake to revise or update any forward-looking statements. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements include statements about our business, including, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies and objectives. Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, expect, intend, anticipate, estimate, believe, continue or other similar words. These statements include our plans and objectives for future operations, including plans and objectives relating to future growth and availability of funds for repurchases, and are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to these statements involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to accurately predict and many of which are beyond our control. 
 
 Although we believe the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements, and the forward-looking statements themselves, are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that these forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate and our actual results, performance and achievements may be materially different from that expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in these forward looking statements, the inclusion of this information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans, which we consider to be reasonable, will be achieved. 
 
 You should carefully review Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. Except as otherwise required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Overview 
 
 We were formed on June 22, 2017 as a Maryland corporation to invest primarily in stabilized, income-oriented commercial real estate and debt secured by commercial real estate. Our portfolio is principally comprised of properties located in the United States and is diversified on a global basis through investments in properties outside of the United States, with a focus on Europe. To a lesser extent, we also invest in real estate debt, including loans secured by real estate and real estate-related securities. We are an externally advised, perpetual-life REIT. We own all or substantially all of our assets through the Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We and the Operating Partnership are externally managed by the Advisor. 
 
 Our board of directors has at all times oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to an advisory agreement among the Advisor, the Operating Partnership and us (the Advisory Agreement ), we have delegated to the Advisor the authority to source, evaluate and monitor our investment opportunities and make decisions related to the acquisition, management, financing and disposition of our assets, in accordance with our investment objectives, guidelines, policies and limitations, subject to oversight by our board of directors. 
 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2019. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent we annually distribute all of our net taxable income (determined without regard to our net capital gain and dividends-paid deduction) to stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
 
 33 

Public Offerings 
 
 On December 27, 2017, we commenced our initial public offering of up to 5.0 billion in shares of our common stock. On June 2, 2021, our initial public offering terminated and we commenced our follow-on public offering of up to 10.0 billion in shares of common stock. 
 
 On August 10, 2022, the follow-on public offering terminated and we commenced our third public offering of up to 18.0 billion in shares of common stock, consisting of up to 16.0 billion in shares in our primary offering and up to 2.0 billion in shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. We intend to continue selling shares in our third public offering on a monthly basis. 
 
 As of November 13, 2024, we had received net proceeds of 14.0 billion from the sale of our common stock through our public offerings. We have contributed the net proceeds from our public offerings to the Operating Partnership in exchange for a corresponding number of Class T, Class S, Class D and Class I units. The Operating Partnership has primarily used the net proceeds to make investments in real estate and real estate debt as further described below under Portfolio. 
 
 DST Program 
 
 In April 2024, we, through the Operating Partnership, commenced the DST Program to issue and sell up to a maximum aggregate offering amount of 1.0 billion of DST Interests in specific DSTs holding one or more DST Properties. These DST Interests will be issued and sold to accredited investors, as that term is defined under Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act, in private placements exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act (the DST Offerings ). 
 
 Under the DST Program, each DST Property may be sourced from our real properties or from third parties, which will be held in a DST 
 are leased-back to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership on a long-term basis through January 2, 2031, unless sooner terminated pursuant to master lease agreements. Each master lease agreement will be guaranteed by the Operating Partnership, which will retain a fair market value option (the FMV Option ), giving it the right, but not the obligation, to acquire the DST Interests in the applicable DST from the investors in exchange for Operating Partnership units or cash, at the Operating Partnership s discretion. Such FMV Option shall be exercisable any time after two years from the closing of the applicable DST Offering. The Operating Partnership, in its sole and absolute discretion, may assign its rights in the FMV Option to a subsidiary, an affiliate, a successor entity to the Operating Partnership or the acquiror of a majority of the Operating Partnership s assets. After a one-year holding period, investors who acquire Operating Partnership units pursuant to the FMV Option generally have the right to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of their Operating Partnership units for, at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. 
 
 We expect that the DST Program will give us the opportunity to expand and diversify our capital-raising strategies by offering what we believe to be an attractive investment product for investors that may be seeking like-kind replacement properties to complete tax-deferred exchange transactions under Section 1031 of the Code. Affiliates of the Advisor are expected to receive fees in connection with the sale of the DST Interests and the management of the DSTs. We intend to use the net offering proceeds from the DST Program to make investments in accordance with our investment strategy and policies, reduce our borrowings, repay indebtedness, fund the repurchase of shares of all classes of our common stock under our share repurchase plan and for other corporate purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have raised approximately 13.2 million in gross offering proceeds through the DST Program. 
 
 Investment Objectives 
 
 Our investment objectives are to invest in assets that will enable us to: 
 provide current income in the form of regular, stable cash distributions to achieve an attractive distribution yield; 

preserve and protect invested capital; 

realize appreciation in NAV from proactive investment management and asset management; and 

provide an investment alternative for stockholders seeking to allocate a portion of their long-term investment portfolios to commercial real estate with lower volatility than publicly traded real estate companies. 

We cannot assure you that we will achieve our investment objectives. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional details.

Recent Developments 
 Business Outlook 
 
 Since inception, our asset allocation and market selection has provided attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors. As of September 30, 2024, on our Class I shares, we have delivered a 7.0 inception-to-date annualized return as well as a 5.6 annualized distribution rate, which is approximately 9.5 on a tax-equivalent basis for investors in the highest income tax bracket. 
 
 We remain well-positioned with 92 of our portfolio allocated to asset classes currently performing well, including affordable housing, market-rate apartments, industrial, and floating-rate real estate loans. Market fundamentals remain strong across our portfolio. Demand for multifamily apartments has remained robust with absorption levels near 20-year highs. Affordability continues to play a key factor. Our average multifamily rent of 1,503 per month was approximately 42 lower than the median U.S. mortgage payment as of October 31, 2024. Wage growth has also outpaced rent growth, which has improved the rent-to-income of our portfolio and now stands at approximately 21 . Bigger picture, supply/demand fundamentals continue to benefit from an estimated four to five million unit shortfall of housing. In addition, multifamily construction starts are down 40-50 from peak which should lead to a decline in new supply and improving fundamentals starting next year. Our affordable housing portfolio remains a key differentiator with strong rent growth in 2024 driven by formulaic rent increases determined by consumer price index and wage growth. A portion of our historical allowable rent increases have been deferred into the future, which should enable steady rent growth over the next several years. Industrial continues to benefit from the growth in e-commerce and the need to deliver products to consumers faster. We primarily own in-fill, last mile or infrastructure centric assets which have been more insulated from supply growth. Our releasing spreads were approximately a positive 59 in the third quarter of 2024 and increased to approximately 49 over the trailing twelve months. There is significant growth potential over the next several years with market rents approximately 20 above current in-place rents and market rents in our markets continuing to grow at approximately 3 year-over-year in the third quarter of 2024. Similar to multifamily, industrial fundamentals should also benefit from significant decline in new supply starting next year with construction starts down approximately 60-70 from peak. 
 
 We believe that our balance sheet remains an asset to investors in the current environment. We have emphasized downside protection with approximately 94 of our secured property debt currently being effectively fixed and having four years of duration remaining. At present, our portfolio has an average cost of debt of approximately 3.8 with limited near-term loan maturities. In addition, assuming all available extension options, we have less than approximately 7 of our debt maturing before 2026. The major challenge for most investors in this environment is maturing debt or unhedged interest rates, and we are well positioned from this perspective. 
 
 As anticipated, the capital markets have continued to improve over the prior two quarters. Along with the Federal Reserve s cumulative 75 basis point interest rate cuts in September 2024 and November 2024, lender spreads have declined and the availability of debt has increased. At the same time, transaction activity has begun to recover. We believe private real estate values have increased year-to-date and the public markets (generally a leading indicator) have rallied approximately 20-30 in our core sectors of rental residential and industrial from one year ago. So, while limiting the level of permitted share repurchases in May 2024 was a very difficult decision to make, we believe it will ultimately be the right decision for our long-term shareholders. 
 
 Our current liquidity is approximately 0.6 billion, or 6.4 of our NAV as of September 30, 2024. We continue to assess select asset sales and other strategic initiatives that are likely to increase our liquidity and potentially result in a reduction of repurchase requests. We believe improving conditions for real estate, combined with declining competitive yields from money market funds, certificates of deposits CDs ), or other short-term instruments (as a result of the cumulative 75 basis point interest rate cuts in September 2024 and November 2024, and the prospect of additional cuts by year end) should also make real estate a more attractive sector for investors. Our repurchase requests have trended lower since May and new repurchase requests in September were the lowest since we began prorating repurchases in November 2022. 
 
 Share Repurchase Plan Amendment 
 
 We are committed to providing liquidity to our stockholders and believe this commitment is an essential attribute of our operations. To provide this liquidity, we have taken a balanced approach, including the select sale of real estate assets, the sale of securities, and the utilization of cash-on-hand and the availability on our line of credit, as further discussed below in Item 2. Liquidity and Capital Resources. Repurchase requests have remained above our share repurchase plan s monthly and quarterly limits since October 2022. To meet this continued level of repurchase requests, real estate property sales became increasingly necessary to execute our ongoing liquidity strategy. Due to increased interest rates and decreased property transaction volumes, we have chosen to slow our property sales. We also believe the real estate markets are near-bottom and the increased probability of interest rate cuts have led to our belief 
 35 

that the real estate markets will improve over time. As a result, and as a fiduciary to our stockholders, we previously could not recommend being an aggressive seller of real estate assets. 
 
 For the foregoing reasons, after careful consideration and thoughtful debate, we amended our share repurchase plan in May 2024 such that, beginning with repurchases during the month of May 2024, we limit share repurchases to 0.33 of NAV per month (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding month) and, beginning on July 1, 2024, we limit share repurchases to 1 of NAV per quarter (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter). 
 
 Our current outlook, which includes the Federal Reserve s lower interest rate forecast, improving capital markets visible today with declining lender spreads, and the 50-70 decline in new construction starts across residential and industrial, our major sectors, all point to what we believe is an improving environment for real estate. We continue to assess select asset sales and other strategic initiatives that are likely to increase our liquidity and potentially result in a reduction of repurchase requests. 
 
 In connection with the share repurchase plan amendment, our Advisor has agreed, commencing with the month of May 2024, to waive 20 of its management fee, thereby reducing it from 1.25 of NAV to 1.0 of NAV, until our share repurchase plan has been reinstated to the monthly repurchase limit of 2 of NAV (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding month) and quarterly repurchase limit of 5 of NAV (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter). 
 
 Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure relating to material trends or uncertainties that may impact our business.

(1) Certain of the joint venture agreements entered into by us provide the other partner a profits interest based on certain internal rate of return hurdles being achieved. Such investments are consolidated by us and any profits interest due to the other partner will be reported within non-controlling interests in consolidated joint ventures on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The table also includes two investments (197 total properties) owned by two unconsolidated real estate ventures. 

(2) The occupancy rate for our industrial, office and self-storage investments is defined as all leased square footage divided by the total available square footage as of September 30, 2024. The occupancy rate for our multifamily and single-family rental investments is defined as the number of leased units divided by the total unit count as of September 30, 2024. The occupancy rate for our other investments is defined as all leased square footage divided by the total available square footage as well as the trailing 12 month average occupancy for hospitality and extended stay investments for the period ended September 30, 2024. 

(3) Held through our DST Program as of September 30, 2024. These properties have been consolidated on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any profits interest due to the third-party investors in the DST Program are reported within non-controlling interests in consolidated joint ventures on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

(4) Includes 1.0 million sq. ft. across our medical office and retail properties and 25,602 keys at our hospitality and extended stay properties. 

(5) Investment in unconsolidated real estate venture. 

Impairment of Investments in Real Estate 
 
 Management reviews its consolidated real estate properties for impairment each quarter or when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impaired value. If the carrying amount of the real estate investment is no longer recoverable and exceeds the fair value of such investment, an impairment loss is recognized. The impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated future cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Since cash flows on real estate properties are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized, and such loss could be material to our results. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 1.8 million impairment charge on one hospitality property. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an aggregate of 3.7 million of impairment charges on two hospitality properties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an aggregate of 188.8 million of impairment charges related predominantly to single-family rental properties and, to a lesser extent, two hospitality properties. 
 
 Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures 
 
 Management reviews its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for impairment each quarter and will record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying values has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. The ultimate realization of the investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not recognize any impairments on our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures.

(1) Annualized base rent is determined from the annualized base rent per leased square foot of the applicable year and excludes tenant recoveries, straight-line rent and above-market and below-market lease amortization. 

Certain operating leases contain early termination options that require advance notification and may include payment of penalty, which, in most cases, is substantial enough to be deemed economically disadvantageous by a tenant to exercise. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 1 of our industrial portfolio square footage and approximately 25 of our office portfolio square footage is subject to early termination provisions. Approximately 7 of our office portfolio that is subject to these early termination provisions have early termination dates prior to January 1, 2028. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, two tenants exercised early lease termination provisions, impacting 56,747 square feet across our industrial and office properties, which represents 0.2 of our combined square footage owned across our industrial and office properties. During the year ended December 31, 2023, two tenants exercised early lease termination provisions, impacting 64,122 square feet across our industrial and office properties, which represents 0.3 of our combined square footage owned across our industrial and office properties.

Revenues 
 
 Rental revenue primarily consists of base rent arising from tenant leases at our multifamily, single-family rental, industrial, office, self-storage and other properties. Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease, including any rent steps or abatement provisions. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, rental revenue was 414.9 million and 418.3 million, respectively. The decrease in rental revenue was driven by the impact of asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2023, offset by an increase in average rental rates for multifamily and industrial assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other revenue primarily consists of revenue generated by our hospitality properties. Hospitality revenue consists primarily of room revenue. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other revenue was 9.9 million and 14.8 million, respectively, resulting in a year over year decrease of approximately 4.8 million driven by sales of hospitality assets. 
 Expenses 
 
 Property operating expenses consist of the costs of ownership and operation of our real estate investments. Examples of property operating expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and repair and maintenance expenses. Property operating expenses also include general and administrative expenses unrelated to the operations of the properties. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, property operating expenses were 183.6 million and 189.1 million, respectively. The decrease was driven primarily by asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 General and administrative expenses are corporate-level expenses that relate mainly to our compliance and administration costs and consist primarily of legal fees, accounting fees, transfer agent fees and other professional fees. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased 0.4 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Management fees are earned by our Advisor for providing services pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, management fees were 23.7 million and 37.3 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily 
 43 

driven by the reduction in our average NAV from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The decrease was also driven by the 20 waiver of the Advisor s management fee effective in May 2024, thereby reducing fees from 1.25 of NAV to 1 of NAV, until our share repurchase plan has been reinstated to the monthly repurchase limit of 2 of NAV and quarterly repurchase limit of 5 of NAV. 
 
 Performance participation allocation relates to allocations from the Operating Partnership to the Special Limited Partner based on the total return of the Operating Partnership. Total return is defined as distributions paid or accrued plus the change in NAV. The performance participation allocation is measured annually and any amount earned by the Special Limited Partner becomes payable as of December 31 of the applicable year. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was no performance participation allocation as the return hurdle was not achieved. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 1.8 million impairment charge on one hospitality property. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an aggregate 3.7 million of impairment charges on two hospitality properties. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by the values assigned to buildings, personal property and in-place lease assets as part of the initial purchase price allocation. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation and amortization expenses were 185.1 million and 203.6 million, respectively. The decrease in depreciation expense was driven by a reduction in investments in real estate, net as a result of asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Other Expense 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, income from investments in real estate debt, net was 21.5 million and 42.3 million, respectively, which consisted of interest income, realized losses, and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of our real estate debt investments and related hedges. The decrease was primarily driven by the disposition of our investments in real estate debt securities and the disposition of our GBP-denominated term loan investment. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 0.2) million of net losses from the disposition of 26 single-family rental units. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 67.4 million of net aggregate gains from the disposition of three multifamily properties and 1,910 single-family rental units. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest expense was 165.5 million and 145.3 million, respectively, which primarily consisted of interest expense incurred on our mortgage notes, credit facility, Line of Credit and borrowings under our secured financing on investments in real estate debt. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in borrowings on our unsecured line of credit. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other expense, net was 207.5) million and 10.1) million, respectively. These results were primarily driven by unrealized losses relating to the changes in the fair value of our interest rate caps and swaps of 193.2) million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to unrealized losses relating to the changes in fair value of our interest rate caps and swaps of 15.6) million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The interest rate caps and swaps are used primarily to limit our interest rate payments on certain of our variable rate borrowings.

Revenues 
 
 Rental revenue primarily consists of base rent arising from tenant leases at our multifamily, single-family rental, industrial, office, self-storage and other properties. Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease, including any rent steps or abatement provisions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, rental revenue was 1.2 billion and 1.3 billion, respectively. The decrease in rental revenue was driven by the impact of asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2023, offset by an increase in average rental rates for multifamily and industrial assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other revenue primarily consists of revenue generated by our hospitality properties. Hospitality revenue consists primarily of room revenue. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other revenue was 30.2 million and 45.6 million, respectively, resulting in a year over year decrease of approximately 15.4 million driven by sales of hospitality assets. 
 Expenses 
 
 Property operating expenses consist of the costs of ownership and operation of our real estate investments. Examples of property operating expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and repair and maintenance expenses. Property operating expenses also include general and administrative expenses unrelated to the operations of the properties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, property operating expenses were 543.7 million and 571.4 million, respectively. The decrease was driven primarily by asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 General and administrative expenses are corporate-level expenses that relate mainly to our compliance and administration costs and consist primarily of legal fees, accounting fees, transfer agent fees and other professional fees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased 3.0 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and was primarily driven by an increase in professional fees. 
 
 Management fees are earned by our Advisor for providing services pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, management fees were 82.2 million and 119.0 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by the reduction in our average NAV from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The decrease was also driven by the 20 waiver of the Advisor s management fee effective in May 2024, thereby reducing fees from 1.25 of NAV to 1 of NAV, until our share repurchase plan has been reinstated to the monthly repurchase limit of 2 of NAV and quarterly repurchase limit of 5 of NAV.

Performance participation allocation relates to allocations from the Operating Partnership to the Special Limited Partner based on the total return of the Operating Partnership. Total return is defined as distributions paid or accrued plus the change in NAV. The performance participation allocation is measured annually and any amount earned by the Special Limited Partner becomes payable as of December 31 of the applicable year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was no performance participation allocation as the return hurdle was not achieved. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 1.8 million impairment charge on one hospitality property. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an aggregate 188.8 million of impairment charges related primarily to single-family rental properties. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by the values assigned to buildings, personal property and in-place lease assets as part of the initial purchase price allocation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation and amortization expenses were 557.4 million and 612.9 million, respectively. The decrease in depreciation expense was primarily driven by a reduction in investments in real estate, net as a result of asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Other Expense 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, income from investments in real estate debt, net was 74.4 million and 115.8 million, respectively, which consisted of interest income, realized losses, and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of our real estate debt investments and related hedges. The decrease was primarily driven by the disposition of our investments in real estate debt securities and the disposition of our GBP-denominated term loan investment. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 2.4 million of net gains from the disposition of 78 single-family rental units. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 188.6 million of net aggregate gains from the disposition of nine multifamily properties, one industrial property, and 2,183 single-family rental units. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest expense was 477.7 million and 437.9 million, respectively, which primarily consisted of interest expense incurred on our mortgage notes, credit facility, Line of Credit and borrowings under our secured financings on investments in real estate debt. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in borrowings on our unsecured line of credit resulting in additional interest expense on our borrowings. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other expense, net was 214.3) million and 86.5) million, respectively. These results were primarily driven by unrealized losses relating to the changes in fair value of our interest rate caps and swaps of 233.6) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to unrealized losses relating to the changes in fair value of our interest rate caps and swaps of 91.4) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The interest rate caps and swaps are used primarily to limit our interest rate payments on certain of our variable rate borrowings. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these results were partially offset by realized gains on foreign currency exchange transactions of 12.1 million. 
 
 Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations 
 
 We believe funds from operations FFO is a meaningful supplemental non-GAAP operating metric. Our consolidated financial statements are presented under historical cost accounting which, among other things, requires depreciation of real estate investments to be calculated on a straight-line basis. As a result, our operating results imply that the value of our real estate investments will decrease evenly over a set time period. However, we believe that the value of real estate investments will change over time based on market conditions and as such, depreciation under historical cost accounting may be less informative. FFO is a standard REIT industry metric defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). 
 
 FFO, as defined by NAREIT and presented below, is calculated as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding (i) gains or losses from sales of depreciable real property, (ii) impairment write-downs on depreciable real property, (iii) plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, (iv) net gains or losses from sales of real estate, and (v) similar adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 
 We also believe that adjusted FFO AFFO is a meaningful supplemental non-GAAP disclosure of our operating results. AFFO further adjusts FFO in order for our operating results to reflect the specific characteristics of our business by adjusting for items we believe are not related to our core operations. Our adjustments to FFO to arrive at AFFO include removing the impact of (i) straight-line rental income and expense, (ii) deferred income amortization, (iii) amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles, (iv) 
 46 

amortization of mortgage premium / discount, (v) unrealized gains or losses from changes in the fair value of real estate debt and other financial instruments, (vi) gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translations, (vii) amortization of restricted stock awards, (viii) non-cash performance participation allocation, even if repurchased by us, (ix) amortization of deferred financing costs, (x) gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, and (xi) similar adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. AFFO is not defined by NAREIT and our calculation of AFFO may not be comparable to disclosures made by other REITs.

FFO and AFFO should not be considered to be more relevant or accurate than the GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in evaluating our operating performance. In addition, FFO and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as indications of our performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as indications of our liquidity, but rather should be reviewed in conjunction with these and other GAAP measurements. Further, FFO and AFFO are not intended to be used as liquidity measures indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 
 Net Asset Value 
 
 Our board of directors, including all of our independent directors, has adopted valuation guidelines that contain a comprehensive set of methodologies to be used by the Advisor, our independent valuation advisor and third-party appraisal firms in connection with estimating the values of our assets and liabilities for purposes of our NAV calculation. These guidelines are designed to produce a fair and accurate estimate of the price that would be received for our investments in an arm s-length transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller in possession of all material information about our investments. Our independent valuation advisor reviews our valuation guidelines and methodologies related to investments in real property with the Advisor and our board of directors at least annually. From time to time, our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, may adopt changes to the valuation guidelines if it (i) determines that such changes are likely to result in a more accurate reflection of NAV or a more efficient or less costly procedure for the determination of NAV without having a material adverse effect on the accuracy of such determination or (ii) otherwise reasonably believes a change is appropriate for the determination of NAV.

For more information on our NAV calculation and valuation guidelines, please refer to Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Please also refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented, for additional disclosure relating to material trends or uncertainties that may impact our NAV and our business.

The following details the adjustments to reconcile stockholders equity to our NAV: 
 
 Accrued stockholder servicing fee represents the accrual for the full cost of the stockholder servicing fee for Class T, Class S and Class D shares. Under GAAP, we accrued the full cost of the stockholder servicing fee payable over the life of each share (assuming such share remains outstanding the length of time required to pay the maximum stockholder servicing fee) as an offering cost at the time we sold the Class T, Class S and Class D shares. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further details of the GAAP treatment regarding the stockholder servicing fee. For purposes of NAV, we recognize the stockholder servicing fee as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis. 

The Advisor advanced organization and offering costs for our initial public offering (other than upfront selling commissions, dealer manager fees and stockholder servicing fees) on our behalf through December 21, 2019. Such costs are reimbursed to the Advisor pro rata over 60 months following December 21, 2019. Under GAAP, organization costs are expensed as incurred and offering costs are charged to equity as such amounts are incurred. For NAV, such costs are recognized as a reduction to NAV as they are reimbursed ratably over 60 months. 

Our investments in real estate are presented under historical cost in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Additionally, our mortgage notes, secured credit facilities, secured financings on investments in real estate debt and unsecured line of credit Debt are presented at their carrying value in our condensed consolidated financial statements. As such, any changes in the fair value of our Debt are not included in our GAAP results. For purposes of determining our NAV, our investments in real estate and our Debt are recorded at fair value. 

We depreciate our investments in real estate and amortize certain other assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. Such depreciation and amortization is not recorded for purposes of determining our NAV. 

49 

Distributions 
 Since February 2019, we have declared monthly distributions for each class of our common stock, which are generally paid three business days after month-end. Each class of our common stock received the same gross distribution per share, which was an aggregate of 0.9315 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The net distribution varies for each class based on the applicable stockholder servicing fee, which is deducted from the gross distribution per share and paid to the Dealer Manager. The table below details the net distribution for each of our share classes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 From a liquidity perspective, we have approximately 0.6 billion of liquidity as of September 30, 2024, comprised of approximately 0.3 billion of cash on hand, approximately 0.2 billion of an undrawn unsecured Line of Credit, and 150.0 million of an undrawn senior secured revolving credit facility. 
 Our primary needs for liquidity and capital resources are to fund our investments, to make distributions to our stockholders, to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan, to pay our offering and operating expenses and capital expenditures and to pay debt service on the outstanding indebtedness we incur. Our operating expenses include, among other things, fees and expenses related to managing our properties and other investments, the management fee we pay to the Advisor (to the extent the Advisor elects to receive the management fee in cash), the performance participation allocation that the Operating Partnership will pay to the Special Limited Partner (when earned and to the extent that the Special Limited Partner elects to receive the performance participation allocation in cash) and general corporate expenses. 
 50 

Our cash needs for acquisitions and other investments will be funded primarily from the sale of shares of our common stock and through the assumption or incurrence of debt. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we raised 0.2 billion of gross proceeds in our third public offering. Other potential future sources of capital include secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and proceeds from the sale of assets and investments in real estate-related debt. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. From inception through September 30, 2024, our distributions have been entirely funded from cash flow from operating activities. In addition, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have repurchased 0.1 billion and 1.0 billion in shares of our common stock under our share repurchase plan.

During the period from October 1, 2024 through November 13, 2024, we raised an aggregate of 6.9 million in our third public offering and repurchased 60.0 million of common stock under our share repurchase plan. In October 2024, we received repurchase requests in excess of the 0.33 monthly limit. As per the terms of our share repurchase plan, we honored all repurchase requests for October 2024 on a pro rata basis up to the 0.33 monthly limitation. As such, approximately 4 of each stockholder s October repurchase request was satisfied. 
 
 During the period from October 1, 2024 through November 13, 2024, we received 70.5 million of net borrowings from our unsecured line of credit.

(390,543) 

Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by approximately 78.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in net interest expense during the period and a reduction in property operating income as a result of asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Cash flows provided by investing activities decreased by approximately 0.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of 1.4 billion in proceeds from dispositions of real estate, offset by an increase of 0.6 billion in proceeds from the dispositions of real estate debt investments and real estate debt securities. 
 
 Cash flows used in financing activities decreased by approximately 1.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a 1.0 billion decrease in repurchases of our common stock, a 0.6 billion decrease in net borrowings on our mortgage notes, credit facility and unsecured line of credit, and was offset by 0.2 billion in repayments under secured financings on investments in real estate debt and a 0.2 billion decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves significant judgments and assumptions and requires estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. These judgments will affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. We consider our accounting policies over investments in real estate and lease intangibles, investments in real estate debt, and revenue recognition to be our critical accounting policies. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further descriptions of such accounting policies.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no existing off-balance sheet arrangements.

ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Capital Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to risks related to the equity capital markets and our related ability to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock. We are also exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets, and our related ability to finance our business through borrowings under mortgages, repurchase obligations or other debt instruments. As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to accumulate operating cash flow and therefore requires us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance our business. 
 
 The combination of supply chain and labor shortage concerns, rising financing costs, rising inflationary concerns, market volatility, capital market conditions, including economic impacts resulting from actual or perceived instability in the U.S. banking system, rising oil prices and other geopolitical risks arising from the ongoing Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars, have resulted in extreme volatility in a variety of global markets, including the real estate related debt markets. Recent bank failures and consolidations have contributed to volatility in global markets and resulted in diminished liquidity and credit availability in the market broadly. We have received and may in the future receive margin calls from our lenders as a result of the decline in the market value of assets pledged by us to our lenders under our secured financings on investments in real estate debt, and if we fail to resolve such margin calls when due by payment of cash or delivery of additional collateral, the lenders may exercise remedies including taking ownership of the assets securing the applicable obligations. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our variable-rate mortgage indebtedness, variable-rate secured credit facilities, secured financing on investments in real estate debt and our unsecured line of credit, where an increase in interest rates would directly result in higher interest expense costs. We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing a mix of fixed and floating rate financings with staggered maturities and through interest rate protection agreements to fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of our variable rate indebtedness was 11.9 billion. 
 
 Certain of our mortgage loans and secured financings on investments in real estate debt are variable rate and are indexed to the one-month SOFR or other benchmark rates. We have executed interest rate caps and swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 10.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 to hedge the risk of increasing interest rates. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 10 basis point increase in the SOFR or other benchmark rates would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of 0.2 million and 0.6 million, net of the impact of our interest rate caps and swaps. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 We intend to hedge our currency exposures in a prudent manner to the extent it is cost effective to do so. However, our currency hedging strategies may not eliminate all of our currency risk due to, among other things, uncertainties in the timing and/or amount of payments received on the related investments, and/or unequal, inaccurate, or unavailable hedges to perfectly offset changes in future exchange rates. Additionally, we may be required under certain circumstances to collateralize our currency hedges for the benefit of the hedge counterparty, which could adversely affect our liquidity. 
 
 Consistent with our strategy of hedging foreign currency exposure on certain investments, we typically enter into a series of foreign currency forward contracts to fix the U.S. dollar amount of foreign currency denominated cash flows (interest income, rental income, principal payments and net sales proceeds after the repayment of debt) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated investments. 
 Investments in Real Estate Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 1.0 billion of investments in real estate debt. Our investment in real estate debt is floating rate and indexed to various benchmark rates and as such, are exposed to interest rate risk. Our net income will increase or decrease depending on interest rate movements. While we cannot predict factors that may or may not affect interest rates, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 10 basis point increase or decrease in the various benchmark rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease to income from investments in real estate debt of 0.2 million and 0.8 million, respectively. 
 We may also be exposed to market risk with respect to our investments in real estate debt due to changes in the fair value of our investments. We seek to manage our exposure to market risk with respect to our investments in real estate debt by making investments in securities backed by different types of collateral and varying credit ratings. The fair value of our investments may fluctuate, thus the amount we will realize upon any sale of our investments is unknown. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value at which we may sell our investments in real estate debt is not known, but a 10 change in the fair value of our investments in real estate debt may result in an unrealized gain or loss of 95.5 million.

ITEM 4.	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ). Based upon this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (i) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms and (ii) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 54 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1.	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2024, we were not involved in any material legal proceedings. 
 ITEM 1A.	RI SK FACTORS 
 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 

ITEM 2.	UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUI TY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 Except as described below, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act. As described in Note 12 Related Party Transactions to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Advisor is entitled to a management fee payable monthly in cash, shares of common stock, or units of the Operating Partnership, in each case at the Advisor s election. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Advisor elected to receive its management fees in Class I shares and we issued an aggregate of 713,039 unregistered Class I shares to the Advisor in satisfaction of the management fee for July 2024 and August 2024. Additionally, we issued 355,802 unregistered Class I shares to the Advisor in October 2024 in satisfaction of the September 2024 management fee. The shares were issued at the applicable NAV per share at the end of each month for which the fee was earned. Each issuance to the Advisor was made pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 
 Share Repurchase Plan 
 
 We have adopted a share repurchase plan, whereby on a monthly basis, stockholders may request that we repurchase all or any portion of their shares. We may choose to repurchase all, some or none of the shares that have been requested to be repurchased at the end of any particular month, in our discretion, subject to any limitations in the share repurchase plan. 
 
 The total amount of aggregate repurchases of Class T, Class S, Class D, and Class I shares (excluding any early repurchase deduction) is limited. From our inception until our share repurchase plan was amended as described below, the total amount of shares that we could repurchase was limited to 2 of the aggregate NAV per month (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding month) and 5 of the aggregate NAV per calendar quarter (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter). On May 23, 2024, we amended our share repurchase plan such that, beginning with repurchases during the month of May 2024, we will limit share repurchases to 0.33 of NAV per month (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding month) and, beginning on July 1, 2024, we will limit share repurchases to 1 of NAV per quarter (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter). See Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Recent Developments. 
 
 Shares are repurchased at a price equal to the transaction price on the applicable repurchase date, subject to any early repurchase deduction. Shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year are repurchased at 95 of the transaction price. Due to the illiquid nature of investments in real estate, we may not have sufficient liquid resources to fund repurchase requests and may elect not to repurchase some or all of the shares submitted for repurchase in a given period. Further, we may make exceptions to, modify or suspend the share repurchase plan. Our board of directors may also determine to terminate our share repurchase plan if required by applicable law or in connection with a transaction in which our stockholders receive liquidity for their shares of our common stock, such as a sale or merger of our company or listing of our shares on a national securities exchange. 
 
 If the transaction price for the applicable month is not made available by the tenth business day prior to the last business day of the month (or is changed after such date), then no repurchase requests will be accepted for such month and stockholders who wish to have their shares repurchased the following month must resubmit their repurchase requests.

(1) Repurchases are limited under the share repurchase plan as described above, which was first announced in December 2017. Under the share repurchase plan, we were authorized to repurchase up to an aggregate of 91.3 million of Class T, Class S, Class D and Class I shares based on our June 30, 2024 NAV in the third quarter of 2024. Pursuant to the share repurchase plan, this amount resets at the beginning of each quarter. Shares repurchased were submitted by our stockholders in the prior month and honored in the current month. 

(2) Share repurchases are funded through a combination of sales of shares of our common stock, borrowings from our unsecured line of credit and proceeds from asset dispositions. 

(3) In July 2024, we received repurchase requests in excess of the 0.33 monthly limit. As per the terms of our share repurchase plan, we honored all repurchase requests for July 2024 on a pro rata basis up to the 0.33 monthly limitation. As such, approximately 4 of each stockholder s July repurchase request was satisfied. In accordance with our repurchase plan, on July 31, 2024, we repurchased all of the shares from stockholders that held less than 500 in shares of our common stock and, as such, we exceeded the 0.33 monthly limitation by 18,093, as authorized by our board of directors. In August 2024, we received repurchase requests in excess of the 0.33 monthly limit. As per the terms of our share repurchase plan, we honored all repurchase requests for August 2024 on a pro rata basis up to the 0.33 monthly limitation. As such, approximately 4 of each stockholder s August repurchase request was satisfied. In accordance with our repurchase plan, on August 31, 2024, we repurchased all of the shares from stockholders that held less than 500 in shares of our common stock and, as such, we exceeded the 0.33 monthly limitation by 7,318, as authorized by our board of directors. In September 2024, we received repurchase requests in excess of the 1.0 quarterly limit. As per the terms of our share repurchase plan, we honored all repurchase requests for September 2024 on a pro rata basis up to the 1.0 quarterly limitation. As such, approximately 4 of each stockholder s September repurchase request was satisfied. In accordance with our repurchase plan, on September 30, 2024, we repurchased all of the shares from stockholders that held less than 500 in shares of our common stock and, as such, we exceeded the 1.0 quarterly limitation by 11,736, as authorized by our board of directors. 

(4) Includes 545,883 Class I shares previously held by the Advisor that were received as payment for its management fee, and that were repurchased outside of our share repurchase plan. The Advisor repurchases were used primarily to settle tax obligations incurred by the Advisor.
