 and , respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized product revenue of and , respectively. Milestone and engineering revenue. Each milestone and engineering arrangement is a separate performance obligation. The transaction price is estimated using the most likely amount method and revenue is recognized as the performance obligation is satisfied through achieving manufacturing, cost, or engineering targets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized total milestone and engineering revenue of and , respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized total milestone and engineering revenue of and , respectively. Government contracts revenue. Revenue from government research and development contracts is generated under terms that are cost plus fee or firm fixed price. The Company generally recognizes this revenue over time using cost-based input methods, which recognizes revenue and gross profit as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs of the contract. In applying cost-based input methods of revenue recognition, the Company uses the actual costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs to determine our progress towards contract completion and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize. Cost based input methods of revenue recognition are considered a faithful depiction of the Company s efforts to satisfy long-term government research and development contracts and therefore reflect the performance obligations under such contracts. Costs incurred that do not contribute to satisfying the Company s performance obligations are excluded from the input methods of revenue recognition as the amounts are not reflective of transferring control under the contract. Costs incurred towards contract completion may include direct costs plus allowable indirect costs and an allocable portion of the fixed fee. If actual and estimated costs to complete a contract indicate a loss, provision is made currently for the loss anticipated on the contract. government contract revenue was recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Accounts Receivable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an accounts receivable, net balance of and , respectively.

(See Note 10 in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023). Diluted earnings per share has been computed by dividing income available to common stockholders adjusted on an if-converted basis for the period by the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common share outstanding (which consist of warrants, options, restricted stock units and convertible securities using the if-converted or treasury stock method to the extent they are dilutive). Approximately thousand and thousand shares of dilutive shares were excluded from the three months period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, EPS calculation as their impact is antidilutive. Approximately thousand and thousand shares of dilutive shares were excluded from the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, EPS calculation as their impact is antidilutive.)

in cash for operations. Current committed product revenues are not anticipated to result in a positive cash flow position for the next twelve months and although the Company has, as of September 30, 2024, working capital of , Management does not believe cash liquidity is sufficient for the next twelve months and will require additional financing or committed purchase orders. The Company continues to look for ways to expand its production of PV films at industrial scale and to secure long-term contracts for the sale of such output. The Company also continues activities related to securing additional financing through strategic or financial investors, but there is no assurance the Company will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company's revenues do not increase rapidly, and/or additional financing is not obtained, the Company will be required to significantly curtail operations to reduce costs and/or sell assets. Such actions would likely have an adverse impact on the Company's future operations. As a result of the Company s recurring losses from operations and the potential need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital requirements, there is uncertainty regarding the Company s ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

 of the entity. Ascent Germany was established to operate a PV manufacturing facility in Germany that will produce and deliver PV Foils exclusively to TubeSolar. There were no Company contributions to Ascent Germany during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Management continues to monitor this situation.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, Management concluded that these assets were impaired and recognized an impairment loss of . The remaining carrying value of the Assets, as of December 31, 2023, was . in payables and any potential future claims the manufacturing facility Landlord may have. The carrying value of the Assets sold was . At March 31, 2024, the Company designated the Assets as assets held for sale as all of the following criteria have been met: (i) a formal commitment to a plan to sell a property has been made and exercised; (ii) the property is available for sale in its present condition; (iii) actions required to complete the sale of the property have been initiated; (iv) sale of the property is probable and we expect the sale will occur within one year; and (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable given its current market value. Assets held for sale were recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment, net in the unaudited condensed balance sheets. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, the Company recorded the carrying value of the property at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and depreciation of the property ceases. As the estimated fair value of and the price the Company sold the Assets for is less than their carrying value, the Company recorded an impairment loss of . Upon completion of the sale, on April 1, 2024, the Company wrote off the remaining carrying value of the Assets and the payables to the Landlord. In September, 2023, Flisom filed for bankruptcy in Switzerland. In February, 2024, the Swiss bankruptcy administrator closed the bankruptcy proceedings due to a lack of assets unless a creditor demands that the bankruptcy proceedings be carried out within the specified period and makes an advance to cover the costs. The deadline for creditors to make their demand has lapsed and the bankruptcy proceedings remained closed. As the bankruptcy proceedings are closed, the Company reversed the Swiss liabilities and recognized a gain on extinguishment of liabilities of in Other income/(expense) on the unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and our audited financial statements and related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 which was filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024. This discussion and analysis contains statements of a forward-looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance. As a result of many factors, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.

Please also see the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Overview 
 We target high-volume production and high-value specialty solar markets. These include terrestrial and space power beaming, space, aerospace, agrivoltaics, and high-value niche manufacturing/construction sectors. This strategy enables us to fully leverage what we believe are the unique advantages of our technology, including flexibility, durability and attractive power to weight and power to area performance. It further enables us to offer unique, differentiated solutions in large markets with less competition, and more attractive pricing. 
 Specifically, we focus on commercializing our proprietary solar technology in two high-value PV verticals: 
 I. Aerospace: Space, Near-space and Fixed Wing UAV 
 II. Agrivoltaics 
 We believe the value proposition of Ascent s proprietary solar technology not only aligns with the needs of customers in these verticals, but also overcomes many of the obstacles other solar technologies face in these unique markets. Ascent has the capability to design and develop finished products for end users in these areas as well as collaborate with strategic partners to design and develop custom integrated solutions for products like airships and fixed-wing UAVs. Ascent sees significant overlap in the needs of end users across some of these verticals and believes it can achieve economies of scale in sourcing, development, and production in commercializing products for these customers. 
 The integration of Ascent's solar modules into space, near space, and aeronautic vehicles with ultra-lightweight and flexible solar modules is an important market opportunity for the Company. Customers in this market have historically required a high level of durability, high voltage and conversion efficiency from solar module suppliers, and we believe our products are well suited to compete in this premium market. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 41,893 of total revenue. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 490,152,872. 
 Due to the high durability enabled by the monolithic integration employed by our technology, the capability to customize modules into different form factors and what we believe is the industry leading light weight and flexibility provided by our modules, we believe that the potential applications for our products are extensive, including integrated solutions anywhere that may need power generation such as vehicles in space or in flight, or dual-use installations on agricultural land.

 Commercialization and Manufacturing Strategy 
 We manufacture our products by affixing a thin Copper-Indium-Gallium-diSelenide ("CIGS") layer to a flexible, plastic substrate using a large format, roll-to-roll process that permits us to fabricate our flexible PV modules in an integrated sequential operation. We use proprietary monolithic integration techniques which enable us to form complete PV modules with little to no back-end assembly cost of inter- cell connections. Traditional PV manufacturers assemble PV modules by bonding or soldering discrete PV cells together. This manufacturing step typically increases manufacturing costs and at times proves detrimental to the overall yield and reliability of the finished product. By reducing or eliminating this added step using our proprietary monolithic integration techniques, we believe we can achieve cost savings in, and increase the reliability of, our PV modules. 
 We plan to continue the development of our current PV technology to increase module efficiency, improve our manufacturing tooling and process capabilities and reduce manufacturing costs. We also plan to continue to take advantage of research and development contracts to fund a portion of this development. 
 Significant Trends, Uncertainties and Challenges 
 We believe the significant trends, uncertainties and challenges that directly or indirectly affect our financial performance and results of operations include: 
 Our operating history and lack of profitability; 

Our ability to develop demand for, and sales of, our products; 

Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to implement our business plan and corporate growth strategies; 

Our ability to develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; 

Our ability to successfully develop and maintain strategic relationships with key partners; 

The accuracy of our estimates and projections; 

Our ability to secure additional financing to fund our short-term and long-term financial needs; 

Our ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market; 

The commencement, or outcome, of legal proceedings against us, or by us, including ongoing litigation proceedings; 

Changes in our business plan or corporate strategies; 

The extent to which we are able to manage the growth of our operations effectively, both domestically and abroad, whether directly owned or indirectly through licenses; 

The supply, availability and price of equipment, components and raw materials, including the elements needed to produce our photovoltaic modules; 

Our ability to expand and protect the intellectual property portfolio that relates to our photovoltaic modules and processes; 

Our ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting; 

Our ability to achieve projected operational performance and cost metrics; and 

General economic and business conditions, and in particular, conditions specific to the solar power industry. 

Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been derived from the accounting records of Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Critical accounting policies used in reporting our financial results are reviewed by management on a regular basis. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Processes used to develop these estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ as outcomes from assumptions may change. 
 The Company s significant accounting policies were described in Note 3 to the audited financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes to our accounting policies as of September 30, 2024.

 Share-based compensation. Share-based compensation expense increased by 215,343 or 155 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is due to the Company's RSU and option grant to employees, directors, and advisory board in 2024. 
 Other Income/Expense. Other income was 571,324 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This includes a gain on settlement of liabilities, interest income, and the reversal of a Swiss liability which were partially offset by interest expense. In comparison, other income for the same period in 2023 was 468,750, primarily due to a one-time employee retention credit, partially offset by interest expense, resulting in an increase of 102,574 between the two periods. 
 Net Loss. Our Net Loss decreased by 218,406, or 11 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to the items mentioned above.

Total Revenues. Our total revenues decreased by 413,587, or 91 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. This is primarily due to a large customer order and engineering revenue in the prior period that was not repeated in the current period. 
 Cost of revenue. Cost of revenues is primarily comprised of repair and maintenance, material costs, and direct labor and overhead expenses. Our Cost of revenues decreased by 1,673,108, or 92 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in manufacturing activities and sales as the Company continued to focused on product and technology improvements in the current period.

Table of Contents 

 Research, development and manufacturing operations. Research, development and manufacturing operations costs include costs incurred for product development, pre-production and production activities in our manufacturing facility. Research, development and manufacturing operations costs also include costs related to technology development. Research, development and manufacturing operations costs decreased by 1,116,190, or 39 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. This is primarily due to a decrease in preproduction and manufacturing operations cost as the Company continued to focused on product and technology improvements in the current period. 
 Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 289,691, or 7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to lower personnel and administrative costs incurred during the first quarter of the current year compared to the prior period. This decrease is partially offset by higher personnel, professional services and other administrative costs incurred during the second and third quarter of the current year. 
 Share-based compensation. Share-based compensation expense decreased by 1,305,033 or 62 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is due to the termination of our former CEO in April 2023. This is partially offset with the Company's RSU and options granted to employees, directors, and advisory board in 2024. 
 Other Income/Expense. Other expense was 579,439 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expense of 1,351,164 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 771,725. The decrease is due primarily to a decrease in interest expense resulting from the conversions and payoff of the December 2022 convertible debt and other income recognized, partially offset by the warrant settlement expense incurred in 2024. Other income in 2024 included a gain on settlement of liabilities, interest income, and the reversal of a Swiss liability. Other income in 2023 included a one-time employee retention credit. 
 Net Loss. Our Net Loss decreased by 4,231,661, or 36 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to the items mentioned above. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company currently has limited PV production at its manufacturing facility. The Company does not expect that sales revenue and cash flows will be sufficient to support operations and cash requirements until it has fully restarted its production at industrial scale and achieved desired improvements to its PV products. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company used 6,897,159 in cash for operations. 
 Additionally, projected total revenues are not anticipated to result in a positive cash flow position for the year overall and, as of September 30, 2024, while the Company has working capital of 1,362,847, Management does not believe cash liquidity is sufficient for the next twelve months and will require additional financing. 
 The Company continues activities related to securing additional financing through strategic or financial investors, but there is no assurance the Company will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company s revenues do not increase rapidly, and/or additional financing is not obtained, the Company will be required to significantly curtail operations to reduce costs and/or sell assets. Such actions would likely have an adverse impact on the Company's future operations. 
 As a result of the Company s recurring losses from operations, and the need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital requirements, there is uncertainty regarding the Company s ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 Statements of Cash Flows Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash used in operations was 6,897,159 compared to 7,329,398 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 432,239. This decrease is due primarily to decreases in

 manufacturing activities as the Company continues to focus on product and technology improvements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was 421 compared to 3,863,963 used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily the result of the asset acquisition in Zurich, Switzerland in the prior period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operations of 6,897,159 were primarily funded from 2023 and 2024 financing agreements. 
 Off Balance Sheet Transactions 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 
 Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 We are a smaller reporting company meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million and our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. As a smaller reporting company, we may rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We hold no significant funds and have no significant future obligations denominated in foreign currencies as of September 30, 2024. 
 Although our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, we may conduct business and incur costs in the local currencies of other countries in which we may operate, make sales and buy materials. As a result, we are subject to currency translation risk. Further, changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar could affect our future net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange losses. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, our cash equivalents consisted operating accounts held with financial institutions and money market fund investments. From time to time, we may hold restricted funds, investments in U.S. government securities and high-quality corporate securities. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand, while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. The direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio, and we do not believe a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 Item 4. Control s and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management conducted an evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Except as discussed in Note 17 to the financial statements, there were no events required to be reported under Item 1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, within Part II, Item 1 of this report. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 In addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to our risk factors from those included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 As long as our executive officers, board members and advisory board members, in the aggregate, maintain their current holdings of our equity securities, they will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval. 
 Upon completion of the Series 1C Preferred Stock funding, executive officers, directors, and advisory board members hold an aggregate of approximately 1,900 shares of Series 1C Preferred Stock. The Series 1C Preferred Stock is entitled to vote along with our common stock on an as-converted to common basis. The shares of Series 1C Preferred Stock owned by such executive officers, directors and advisors (after giving effect to the 4.99 maximum percentage conversion limitations described above) would be entitled to cast, in the aggregate, approximately 15 votes on any matter to be considered by stockholders for approval at any meeting of stockholders of the Company (or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting), based upon approximately 1,324,804 shares of common stock currently outstanding. These executive officers, directors, and advisors, therefore, will, for the foreseeable future, have significant influence over our management and affairs, and will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or sales of our Company or assets. 
 We may not be able to maintain our current listing for our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Failure to maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock. 
 Our inability to maintain our current listing on Nasdaq may limit the liquidity of our stock, increase its volatility, and hinder our ability to raise capital. If our common stock is delisted by Nasdaq, our common stock may be eligible for quotation on an over-the-counter quotation system or on the pink sheets. Upon any such delisting, our common stock would become subject to the regulations of the SEC relating to the market for penny stocks. A penny stock is any equity security not traded on a national securities exchange that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share. The regulations applicable to penny stocks may severely affect the market liquidity for our common stock and could limit the ability of shareholders to sell securities in the secondary market. In such a case, an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock, and there can be no assurance that our common stock will be eligible for trading or quotation on any alternative exchanges or markets. 
 Delisting from Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through public or private sales of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. 
 As previously disclosed, during 2023 and 2024 we were not in compliance with (x) the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market (the Bid Price Requirement and (y) Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) which requires companies listed on Nasdaq to maintain a minimum of 2,500,000 in stockholders equity for continued listing (the Equity Rule ). In September 2024, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq indicating that the Company had regained compliance with the Bid Price Requirement and the Equity Rule. The Company will be subject to a one year Nasdaq Listing Panel Monitor. The Company intends to monitor its bid price and stockholders' equity to remain in compliance with the applicable listing requirements.

 Item 5. Other Information 
 
 Rule 10b5-1 Sales Plans 
 Our policy governing transactions in our securities by directors, officers, and employees permits our officers, directors, and certain other persons to enter into trading plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. Generally, under these trading plans, the individual relinquishes control over the transactions once the trading plan is put into place and can only put such plans into place while the individual is not in possession of material non-public information. Accordingly, sales under these plans may occur at any time, including possibly before, simultaneously with, or immediately after significant events involving our company. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of our directors or executive officers had a Rule 10b5-1 plan in effect.
