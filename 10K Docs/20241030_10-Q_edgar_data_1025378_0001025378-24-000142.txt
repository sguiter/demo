Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report ), including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 2 of Part I of this Report, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believe, project, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, strategy, plan, may, should, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: the NLOP Spin-Off (as defined herein); our expectations surrounding the impact of the broader macroeconomic environment and the ability of tenants to pay rent; our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects; our future capital expenditure and leverage levels, debt service obligations, and plans to fund our liquidity needs; prospective statements regarding our access to the capital markets, including our at-the-market program ATM Program statements that we make regarding our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a real estate investment trust REIT and the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements and other regulatory activity. 
 
 These statements are based on the current expectations of our management. It is important to note that our actual results could be materially different from those projected in such forward-looking statements. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable risks or uncertainties, like the risks related to fluctuating interest rates, the impact of inflation on our tenants and us, the effects of pandemics and global outbreaks of contagious diseases, and domestic or geopolitical crises, such as terrorism, military conflict, war or the perception that hostilities may be imminent, political instability or civil unrest, or other conflict, could also have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects. You should exercise caution in relying on forward-looking statements as they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may materially affect our future results, performance, achievements, or transactions. Information on factors that could impact actual results and cause them to differ from what is anticipated in the forward-looking statements contained herein is included in this Report, as well as in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), including but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 9, 2024 (the 2023 Annual Report ). Moreover, because we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, new risks are likely to emerge from time to time. Given these risks and uncertainties, potential investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as a prediction of future results, which speak only as of the date of this Report, unless noted otherwise. Except as required by federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not undertake to revise or update any forward-looking statements.

 office properties into Net Lease Office Properties NLOP ), so that it became a separate publicly-traded real estate investment trust (the Spin-Off ), and (ii) implementing an asset sale program to dispose of certain office properties retained by us (the Office Sale Program ), which is substantially completed. 
 
 On November 1, 2023, we completed the Spin-Off, contributing office properties to NLOP. Following the closing of the Spin-Off, NLOP operates as a separate publicly-traded REIT, which we externally manage pursuant to certain advisory agreements. Through the date of this Report, we have disposed of of the office properties subject to the Office Sale Program Note 14 ). The final property is under a binding contract for sale scheduled to close in December 2024, which will complete the Office Sale Program. 
 
 Effective January 1, 2024, we no longer separately analyze our business between real estate operations and investment management operations, and instead view the business as one reportable segment, since our investment management operations have been determined to be both quantitatively and qualitatively insignificant to the Company s business. Our business is characterized as investing in operationally-critical, single-tenant commercial real estate properties that are leased on a long-term basis. These economic characteristics are similar across various property types, geographic locations, and industries in which our tenants operate and therefore considered operating segment. The operating results of both the real estate and investment management activities are regularly reviewed, in the aggregate, by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Accordingly, all operations have been considered to represent one reportable segment, which are reported on our consolidated statements of income and our consolidated balance sheets. As a result of this change, we have conformed prior period segment information to reflect how we currently view our business. 
 
 Lease revenues from our real estate investments generate the vast majority of our earnings. We invest primarily in commercial properties located in the United States and Northern and Western Europe, which are leased to companies on a triple-net lease basis. At September 30, 2024, our portfolio was comprised of our full or partial ownership interests in properties, totaling approximately million square feet, substantially all of which were net leased to tenants, with a weighted-average lease term of years and an occupancy rate of . In addition, at September 30, 2024, our portfolio was comprised of full or partial ownership interests in operating properties, including self-storage properties, hotels, and student housing properties, totaling approximately million square feet.

 Note 2. 

In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial information for the interim periods presented in this Report reflects all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in the 2023 Annual Report, as certain disclosures that would substantially duplicate those contained in the audited consolidated financial statements have not been included in this Report. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year. 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 and unconsolidated VIEs, respectively, included our interests in (i) unconsolidated real estate investments, which we account for under the equity method of accounting (we do not consolidate these entities because we are not the primary beneficiary and the nature of our involvement in the activities of these entities allows us to exercise significant influence on, but does not give us power over, decisions that significantly affect the economic performance of these entities), and (ii) unconsolidated investments in equity securities, which we accounted for as investments in shares of the entities at fair value. In addition, at December 31, 2023, we had a variable interest in NLOP, which we also deemed a VIE, due to our guarantee of a non-recourse mortgage loan with approximately million principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2023 encumbering a property that was derecognized in the Spin-Off Note 1 ). This non-recourse mortgage loan was repaid by NLOP during the first quarter of 2024 and as a result, NLOP is not deemed a VIE as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the net carrying amount of our investments in these entities was million and million, respectively, and our maximum exposure to loss in these entities was limited to our investments. 

Revenue from contracts primarily represented hotel operating property revenues of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, generated from hotels located in the United States of which were reclassified from net leases to operating properties in the first quarter of 2023; of these properties were sold during 2023 and was sold during the second quarter of 2024).

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro, as the end-of-period rate for the U.S. dollar in relation to the euro increased by to from . As a result of this fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates, the carrying value of our Land, buildings and improvements net lease and other increased by million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 
 
 On September 1, 2024, we entered into net lease agreements for certain self-storage properties previously classified as operating properties. As a result, in September 2024, we reclassified consolidated self-storage properties with an aggregate carrying value of million from Land, buildings and improvements operating properties to Land, buildings and improvements net lease and other. Effective as of that time, we began recognizing lease revenues from these properties, whereas previously we recognized operating property revenues and expenses from these properties. In addition, in connection with the net lease agreements described above, in September 2024, we reclassified self-storage properties from Equity method investments and recorded million in Land, buildings and improvements net lease and other. Effective as of that time, we began recognizing lease revenues from these properties Note 7 ). 
 
 In connection with changes in lease classifications due to (i) extensions of the underlying leases, (ii) entering into a new lease, or (iii) lease expirations, we reclassified properties with an aggregate carrying value of million from Net investments in finance leases and loans receivable to Land, buildings and improvements net lease and other during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 Note 5 ). 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reclassified properties classified as Land, buildings and improvements net lease and other to Net investments in finance leases and loans receivable since we entered into an agreement to sell the properties to the tenant. As a result, the carrying value of our Land, buildings and improvements net lease and other decreased by million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 Note 5 ). 
 
 Depreciation expense, including the effect of foreign currency translation, on our buildings and improvements subject to operating leases was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 __________ 
 (a) On June 10, 2021, we entered into an agreement to fund a construction loan of approximately million (as of September 30, 2024) for a retail complex in Las Vegas, Nevada. Through September 30, 2024, we funded million, including million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Equity income from this investment was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was recognized within Earnings from equity method investments in our consolidated statements of income. 
 (b) The carrying value of this investment is affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro. 
 (c) This investment is reported using the hypothetical liquidation at book value model, which may be different than pro rata ownership percentages, primarily due to the capital structure of the partnership agreement. 
 (d) We have elected to account for our investment in CESH at fair value by selecting the equity method fair value option available under GAAP. We record our investment in CESH on a one quarter lag; therefore, the balance of our equity method investment in CESH recorded as of September 30, 2024 is based on the estimated fair value of our investment as of June 30, 2024. 
 (e) See Johnson Self Storage below for discussion of this equity method investment. 
 
 We received aggregate distributions of million and million from our unconsolidated real estate investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate unamortized basis differences on our unconsolidated real estate investments were million and million, respectively. We received a distribution from CESH during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of million. We did t receive a distribution from CESH during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Johnson Self Storage 
 
 On September 1, 2024, we acquired the remaining controlling interest in the Johnson Self Storage jointly owned investment for million, bringing our ownership interest to . This investment comprised self-storage operating properties. Following this acquisition, we consolidate the investment. Due to this change in control, we recorded a gain on change in control of interests of approximately million during the third quarter of 2024, which was the difference between our carrying value and the fair value of our previously held equity interest on September 1, 2024 of approximately million and approximately million, respectively. 
 
 In addition, on September 1, 2024, we entered into net lease agreements for these self-storage properties previously classified as operating properties. As a result, in September 2024, we reclassified these self-storage properties from Equity method investments and recorded the following amounts: (i) million to Land, buildings and improvements net lease and other, and (ii) million to In-place lease intangible assets and other. Effective as of that date, we began recognizing lease revenues from these properties.

 Note 8. 
 
 Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
 
 The methods and assumptions described below were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument. For significant Level 3 items, we have also provided the unobservable inputs. 
 
 Derivative Assets and Liabilities Our derivative assets and liabilities, which are included in Other assets, net and Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated financial statements, are comprised of foreign currency collars, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, and stock warrants Note 9 ). 
 
 The valuation of our derivative instruments (excluding stock warrants) is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, as well as observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, spot and forward rates, and implied volatilities. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative instruments for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. These derivative instruments were classified as Level 2 as these instruments are custom, over-the-counter contracts with various bank counterparties that are not traded in an active market. 
 
 The stock warrants were measured at fair value using valuation models that incorporate market inputs and our own assumptions about future cash flows. We classified these assets as Level 3 because these assets are not traded in an active market. 
 
 Equity Method Investment in CESH We have elected to account for our investment in CESH, which is included in Equity method investments in the consolidated financial statements, at fair value by selecting the equity method fair value option available under GAAP Note 7 ). We classified this investment as Level 3 because we primarily used valuation models that incorporate unobservable inputs to determine its fair value. 
 
 Investment in Shares of Lineage We have elected to apply the measurement alternative under Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10) to account for our investment in shares of Lineage (a cold storage REIT), which is included in Other assets, net in the consolidated financial statements. Under this alternative, the carrying value is adjusted for any impairments or changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for similar or identical investments in the issuer. We transferred this investment from Level 3 to Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy during the third quarter of 2024 because Lineage became a publicly traded company during that period. Although its share price is actively traded on an open market, we make an adjustment to the value of our investment based on the promote value that the sponsor of our investment is entitled to. Since we were a legacy investor in Lineage prior to their public offering completed in July 2024, our ownership interest is subject to settlement at the discretion of Lineage over a three-year period, during which we will have the option to settle our investment in the form of cash or common stock. If our investment is not settled by Lineage during the three-year period, our investment will convert to common shares. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a non-cash unrealized loss on our investment in shares of Lineage of million, due to a lower closing share price, which was recorded within Other gains and (losses) in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized dividends of million from our investment in shares of Lineage, which was recorded within Non-operating income in the consolidated financial statements. The fair value of this investment was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively.

 million, which reduced the cost basis of our investment. The fair value of our investment in shares of GCIF was million and million at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Other than the transfer of our investment in shares of Lineage from Level 3 to Level 2 noted above, we did not have any transfers into or out of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 category of measurements during either the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Gains and losses (realized and unrealized) recognized on items measured at fair value on a recurring basis included in earnings are reported within Other gains and (losses) on our consolidated financial statements.

 __________ 
 (a) The carrying value of Senior Unsecured Notes, net Note 10 includes unamortized deferred financing costs of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The carrying value of Non-recourse mortgages, net includes unamortized deferred financing costs of million and less than million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 (b) The carrying value of Senior Unsecured Notes, net includes unamortized discount of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The carrying value of Non-recourse mortgages, net includes unamortized discount of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 (c) For those Senior Unsecured Notes for which there are no observable market prices (specifically, our private placement Senior Unsecured Notes Note 10 )), we used a discounted cash flow model that estimates the present value of future loan payments by discounting such payments at current estimated market interest rates. We consider these notes to be within the Level 3 category. For all other Senior Unsecured Notes, we determined the estimated fair value using observed market prices in an open market, which may experience limited trading volume. We consider these notes to be within the Level 2 category. 
 (d) We determined the estimated fair value of our non-recourse mortgage loans using a discounted cash flow model that estimates the present value of the future loan payments by discounting such payments at current estimated market interest rates. The estimated market interest rates consider interest rate risk and the value of the underlying collateral, which includes quality of the collateral, the credit quality of the tenant/obligor, and the time until maturity. 
 
 We estimated that our other financial assets and liabilities, including amounts outstanding under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and Unsecured Term Loan due 2026 Note 10 ), but excluding finance receivables Note 5 ), had fair values that approximated their carrying values at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Interest Rate Swaps and Caps 
 
 We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. To limit this exposure, we generally seek long-term debt financing on a fixed-rate basis. However, from time to time, we have obtained, and may in the future obtain, variable-rate (i) non-recourse mortgage loans and (ii) unsecured term loans Note 10 and, as a result, we have entered into, and may continue to enter into, interest rate swap agreements or interest rate cap agreements with counterparties. Interest rate swaps, which effectively convert the variable-rate debt service obligations of a loan to a fixed rate, are agreements in which one party exchanges a stream of interest payments for a counterparty s stream of cash flow over a specific period. The notional, or face, amount on which the swaps are based is not exchanged. Interest rate caps limit the effective borrowing rate of variable-rate debt obligations while allowing participants to share in downward shifts in interest rates. Our objective in using these derivatives is to limit our exposure to interest rate movements. 
 
 EUR ) Interest rate swaps USD ) 
 __________ 
 (a) Fair value amounts are based on the exchange rate of the euro at September 30, 2024, as applicable. 
 
 Foreign Currency Collars 
 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate movements, primarily in the euro and, to a lesser extent, the British pound sterling and certain other currencies. In order to hedge certain of our foreign currency cash flow exposures, we enter into foreign currency collars. A foreign currency collar consists of a written call option and a purchased put option to sell the foreign currency at a range of predetermined exchange rates. A foreign currency collar guarantees that the exchange rate of the currency will not fluctuate beyond the range of the options strike prices. Our foreign currency collars have maturities of months or less.

 Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features 
 
 We measure our credit exposure on a counterparty basis as the net positive aggregate estimated fair value of our derivatives, net of any collateral received. collateral was received as of September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, our total credit exposure and the maximum exposure to any single counterparty was million and million, respectively. 
 
 Some of the agreements we have with our derivative counterparties contain cross-default provisions that could trigger a declaration of default on our derivative obligations if we default, or are capable of being declared in default, on certain of our indebtedness. At September 30, 2024, we had not been declared in default on any of our derivative obligations. The estimated fair value of our derivatives in a net liability position was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which included accrued interest and any nonperformance risk adjustments. If we had breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, we could have been required to settle our obligations under these agreements at their aggregate termination value of million and million, respectively. 
 
 Net Investment Hedges

 Exchange rate variations impact our financial results because the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars each period, with the effect of exchange rate variations being recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment. As a result, changes in the value of our borrowings under our euro-denominated senior notes and changes in the value of our euro, Japanese yen, and British pound sterling borrowings under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, related to changes in the spot rates, will be reported in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments, which are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment.

 On May 30, 2023, we acquired the remaining interest in an international jointly owned investment (which we already consolidated) from the noncontrolling interest holders for nominal consideration, bringing our ownership interest to . No gain or loss was recognized on the transaction.

 ATM Program and Forward Equity 
 
 On May 2, 2022, we established a continuous at-the-market offering program ATM Program with a syndicate of banks, pursuant to which shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to billion may be sold (i) directly through or to the banks acting as sales agents or as principal for their own accounts or (ii) through or to participating banks or their affiliates acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers pursuant to a forward sale agreement (our ATM Forwards ). 
 
 During 2023, we settled the ATM Forwards in full prior to the maturity date of each ATM Forward via physical delivery of the outstanding shares of common stock in exchange for cash proceeds. The forward sale price that we received upon physical settlement of the ATM Forwards was (i) subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread (i.e., if the specified daily rate is less than the spread on any day, the interest rate factor will result in a daily reduction of the applicable forward sale price) and (ii) decreased based on amounts related to expected dividends on shares of our common stock during the term of the ATM Forwards. 
 
 We determined that our ATM Forwards met the criteria for equity classification and were therefore exempt from derivative accounting. We recorded the ATM Forwards at fair value at inception, which we determined to be zero. Subsequent changes to fair value are not required under equity classification.

 Terms and Definitions 
 
 Pro Rata Metrics The portfolio information above contains certain metrics prepared on a pro rata basis. We refer to these metrics as pro rata metrics. We have certain investments in which our economic ownership is less than 100 . On a full consolidation basis, we report 100 of the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of those investments that are deemed to be under our control or for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, even if our ownership is less than 100 . Also, for all other jointly owned investments, which we do not control, we report our net investment and our net income or loss from that investment. On a pro rata basis, we generally present our proportionate share, based on our economic ownership of these jointly owned investments, of the portfolio metrics of those investments. Multiplying each of our jointly owned investments financial statement line items by our percentage ownership and adding or subtracting those amounts from our totals, as applicable, may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of holding an ownership interest of less than 100 in our jointly owned investments. 
 
 ABR ABR represents contractual minimum annualized base rent for our net-leased properties and reflects exchange rates as of September 30, 2024. If there is a rent abatement, we annualize the first monthly contractual base rent following the free rent period. ABR is not applicable to operating properties and is presented on a pro rata basis. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Effective January 1, 2024, we no longer separately analyze our business between real estate operations and investment management operations, and instead view the business as one reportable segment. As a result of this change, we have conformed prior period segment information to reflect how we currently view our business Note 1 ). 
 
 We evaluate our results of operations with a primary focus on increasing and enhancing the value, quality, and number of our properties. We focus our efforts on accretive investing and improving portfolio quality through re-leasing efforts, including negotiation of lease renewals, or selectively selling assets in order to increase value in our real estate portfolio.

Lease Revenues 
 
 Existing net-leased properties are those that we acquired or placed into service prior to January 1, 2023 and that were not sold, held for sale, derecognized, or reclassified to operating properties during the periods presented. For the periods presented, there were 1,109 existing net-leased properties, including 12 self-storage properties that converted from operating properties to net leases during the third quarter of 2024 Note 4 , Note 7 ). 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, lease revenues from existing net-leased properties increased due to the following items (in millions): 
 
 __________ 
 (a) During the first quarter of 2024, we entered into a lease restructuring with our tenant Hellweg, which included (i) abated rent from January 1, 2024 to March 31, 2024, (ii) a reduction in annual base rent, and (iii) the reclassification of 13 properties leased to this tenant from direct financing leases to operating leases Note 5 ). 
 (b) Excludes fixed minimum rent increases, which are reflected as straight-line rent adjustments within lease revenues. 
 (c) Includes (i) lease revenues of 0.9 million from 12 self-storage operating properties that were converted to net leases on September 1, 2024 Note 4 , Note 7 and (ii) an increase in lease revenues of 0.4 million as a result of a lease restructuring for 27 existing net-leased self-storage properties that was executed on September 1, 2024.

 23 net-leased properties disposed of during the year ended December 31, 2023; 
 59 net-leased properties derecognized in connection with the Spin-Off Note 1 ); and 
 a portfolio of 12 net-leased hotel properties that converted to operating properties in the first quarter of 2023 upon expiration of the master lease with the Marriott Corporation, after which we began recognizing operating property revenues and expenses from these properties (eight of these properties were sold during the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and one property was sold during the second quarter of 2024).

 W. P. Carey 9/30/2024 10-Q 49 

Operating Property Revenues and Expenses 
 
 Existing operating properties are those that we acquired or placed into service prior to January 1, 2023 and that were not sold, held for sale, or reclassified to net-leased properties during the periods presented. For the periods presented, we recorded operating property revenues from 75 existing operating properties, comprised of 72 self-storage operating properties, two student housing operating properties, and one hotel operating property. 
 
 Operating properties recently reclassified from net-leased properties or recently acquired include (i) three net-leased hotel properties that converted to operating properties in the first quarter of 2023 (after which we began recognizing operating property revenues and expenses from these properties), (ii) five self-storage operating properties acquired during 2023, and (iii) one self-storage operating property acquired during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Operating properties sold, held for sale, derecognized, or reclassified to net-leased properties are comprised of (i) eight hotel operating properties disposed of during 2023 and 2024, (ii) a parking garage attached to a net-leased property that was derecognized in connection with the Spin-Off, and (iii) three self-storage operating properties that were reclassified to net-leased properties during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Other Lease-Related Income 
 
 Other lease-related income is described in Note 4 . 
 
 Asset Management Revenue 
 
 During the periods presented, we earned asset management revenue from (i) NLOP (upon closing of the Spin-Off on November 1, 2023) and (ii) CESH Note 3 ). Asset management revenues from NLOP and CESH are expected to decline as assets are sold (CESH owns one remaining build-to-suit project). 
 
 Other Advisory Income and Reimbursements 
 
 Other advisory income and reimbursements are comprised of (i) fixed administrative fees earned from NLOP (upon closing of the Spin-Off on November 1, 2023) and (ii) reimbursable costs from CESH Note 3 ). 

Operating Expenses 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to the impact of the Spin-Off, the Office Sale Program, and other dispositions, partially offset by the impact of property acquisition activity and certain tenant vacancies (amortization of intangible assets for such properties was accelerated upon vacancy). 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, stock-based compensation expense increased by 4.4 million and 5.4 million, respectively. The increases were primarily due to (i) changes in projected PSU payouts of 2.7 million and 3.3 million, respectively, (ii) the modification of RSUs and PSUs in connection with an executive departure totaling 1.4 million and 1.5 million, respectively, and (iii) the higher value of RSUs granted in 2024 compared to those RSUs that vested in 2024 totaling 0.3 million and 0.6 million, respectively. 
 
 Property Expenses, Excluding Reimbursable Tenant Costs 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, property expenses, excluding reimbursable tenant costs, decreased by 2.0 million primarily due to the impact of the Spin-Off, the Office Sale Program, and other dispositions. 
 
 W. P. Carey 9/30/2024 10-Q 50 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, property expenses, excluding reimbursable tenant costs, increased by 5.9 million primarily due to the release of real estate taxes accrued for a cash basis tenant during the prior year period. The tenant was previously not current on real estate taxes due, and repaid the outstanding amount in the second quarter of 2023. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the Spin-Off, the Office Sale Program, and other dispositions. 
 
 Merger and Other Expenses 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, merger and other expenses are primarily comprised of the write-off of a value added tax receivable that was previously recorded in connection with an international investment. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, merger and other expenses are primarily comprised of costs incurred in connection with the Spin-Off, which was completed in November 2023 Note 1 ). 
 
 Impairment Charges Real Estate 
 
 Our impairment charges on real estate are more fully described in Note 8 . 
 
 Other Income and Expenses, and Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 Other Gains and (Losses) 
 
 Other gains and (losses) primarily consists of gains and losses on (i) foreign currency exchange rate movements, (ii) extinguishment of debt, and (iii) the mark-to-market fair value of equity securities, as well as changes in the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables. The timing and amount of such gains or losses cannot always be estimated and are subject to fluctuation. Certain of our foreign currency-denominated unsecured debt instruments were designated as net investment hedges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Therefore, no gains and losses on foreign currency exchange rate movements were recognized on the remeasurement of such instruments during those periods Note 9 ).

 __________ 
 (a) Remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities that are held by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency are included in other gains and (losses). This includes foreign currency-denominated intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries that are scheduled for settlement. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, our intercompany loans subject to remeasurement were hedged by certain of our foreign currency-denominated unsecured debt that we de-designated as net investment hedges. 
 (b) We acquired a secured loan receivable with a fair value of 13.3 million in our merger with a former affiliate, Corporate Property Associates 17 Global Incorporated, in October 2018, for which the outstanding principal of 24.0 million was fully repaid to us in March 2024 Note 5 ). Therefore, we recorded a 10.7 million gain on repayment of this secured loan receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 W. P. Carey 9/30/2024 10-Q 51 

Interest Expense 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, interest expense decreased by 4.4 million and 13.2 million, respectively, primarily due to (i) lower outstanding balances on our Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) the reduction of our mortgage debt outstanding by prepaying or repaying at or close to maturity a total of 544.6 million of non-recourse mortgage loans with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.7 since January 1, 2023 Note 10 ), and (iii) the derecognition of non-recourse mortgage loans with an aggregate carrying value totaling 164.7 million in connection with the Spin-Off on November 1, 2023, partially offset by (i) higher outstanding balances and interest rates on our Senior Unsecured Notes and (ii) our Unsecured Term Loan due 2026 that we entered into in April 2023 Note 10 ). 
 
 The following table presents certain information about our outstanding debt (dollars in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Average outstanding debt balance 7,993,827 8,595,115 7,923,491 8,473,580 Weighted-average interest rate 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.2 
 
 Gain on Change in Control of Interests 
 
 On September 1, 2024, we acquired the remaining interest in an investment in which we already had a joint interest and accounted for under the equity method. Due to the change in control of this jointly owned investment, we recorded a gain on change in control of interests of 31.8 million reflecting the difference between our carrying value and the fair value of our previously held equity interest. Subsequent to this acquisition, we consolidated this wholly owned investment Note 7 ). 
 
 Gain on Sale of Real Estate, Net 
 
 Gain on sale of real estate, net, consists of gains and losses on the sale of properties that were (i) disposed of, (ii) subject to the exercise of a purchase option, (iii) subject to a purchase agreement resulting in a lease modification during the reporting period, or (iv) included in assets held for sale and subject to a revised estimated purchase price, during the reporting period, as more fully described in Note 4 , Note 5 and Note 14 .

Earnings from Equity Method Investments 
 
 Our equity method investments are more fully described in Note 7 . The following table presents earnings from equity method investments (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Earnings from Equity Method Investments Earnings from Las Vegas Retail Complex (a)

 __________ 
 (a) Increase is due to funding of this construction loan since January 1, 2023, which has an interest rate of 6.0 . 
 (b) On September 1, 2024, we acquired the remaining 10 controlling interest in the Johnson Self Storage jointly owned investment, bringing our ownership interest to 100 . Following this acquisition, we no longer recognize equity income from this consolidated investment Note 7 ). 
 (c) Decrease is due to higher interest expense as a result of refinancing the non-recourse mortgage loan encumbering the properties during the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, provision for income taxes increased by 4.0 million, primarily due to a deferred tax benefit recognized during the prior year period related to an impairment charge recorded on a foreign property. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, provision for income taxes decreased by 6.4 million, primarily due to (i) the impact of international lease restructurings during the current year period, (ii) the impact of international office property dispositions, and (iii) the release of deferred tax assets in connection with the tax restructuring of certain international properties during the prior year period, partially offset by a deferred tax benefit recognized during the prior year period related to an impairment charge recorded on a foreign property. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash During the Period 
 
 We use the cash flow generated from our investments primarily to meet our operating expenses, service debt, and fund dividends to stockholders. Our cash flows fluctuate periodically due to a number of factors, which may include, among other things: the timing of our equity and debt offerings; the timing of purchases and sales of real estate; the timing of the repayment of mortgage loans, our Senior Unsecured Notes, and our Unsecured Term Loans; the timing of our receipt of lease revenues; the timing and amount of other lease-related payments; the timing of settlement of foreign currency transactions; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and the timing of distributions from equity method investments. Despite these fluctuations, we believe that we will generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our normal recurring short-term liquidity needs. We may also use existing cash resources, available capacity under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, proceeds from term loans or other bank debt, proceeds from dispositions of properties (including the Office Sale Program Note 1 )), and the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, such as issuances of common stock through our ATM Program Note 12 ), in order to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We assess our ability to access capital on an ongoing basis. Our sources and uses of cash during the period are described below. 
 
 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 724.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to 807.0 million of proceeds received from the sales of net investments in sales-types leases during the current year period Note 5 ), partially offset by the impact of the Spin-Off and Office Sale Program Note 1 ). 
 
 W. P. Carey 9/30/2024 10-Q 53 

Investing Activities Our investing activities are generally comprised of real estate-related transactions (purchases and sales) and funding for build-to-suit activities and other capital expenditures on real estate. We also received 24.0 million from the repayment of a loan receivable Note 5 ). 
 
 Financing Activities Our financing activities are generally comprised of borrowings and repayments under our Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Unsecured Term Loans, issuances and repayments of the Senior Unsecured Notes, payments and prepayments of non-recourse mortgage loans, issuances of common equity, and payments of dividends to stockholders.

 W. P. Carey 9/30/2024 10-Q 54 

Cash Resources 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our cash resources consisted of the following: 
 
 cash and cash equivalents totaling 818.2 million. Of this amount, 142.0 million, at then-current exchange rates, was held in foreign subsidiaries, and we could be subject to restrictions or significant costs should we decide to repatriate these amounts; 
 funds totaling 27.0 million that are held by an intermediary and have been designated for future 1031 Exchange transactions Note 2 ); 
 our Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, with available capacity of approximately 1.8 billion (net of amounts reserved for standby letters of credit totaling 5.9 million); and 
 unleveraged properties that had an aggregate asset carrying value of approximately 13.4 billion at September 30, 2024, although there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain financing for these properties. 
 
 We may also access the capital markets through additional debt (denominated in both U.S. dollars and euros) and equity offerings, as well as term loans and other bank debt. 
 
 Our cash resources can be used for working capital needs and other commitments and may be used for future investments. 

Cash Requirements and Liquidity 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had (i) 818.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, (ii) 27.0 million of funds that are held by an intermediary and have been designated for future 1031 Exchange transactions Note 2 ), and (iii) approximately 1.8 billion of available capacity under our Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (net of amounts reserved for standby letters of credit totaling 5.9 million). As of September 30, 2024, scheduled debt principal payments total 7.3 million during the remainder of 2024 and 709.5 million during 2025 Note 10 ). 
 
 During the next 12 months following September 30, 2024 and thereafter, we expect that our significant cash requirements will include: 
 
 paying dividends to our stockholders; 
 funding acquisitions of new investments Note 4 ); 
 funding future capital commitments Note 4 and tenant improvement allowances; 
 making scheduled principal and balloon payments on our debt obligations, including 450 million of senior notes due in February 2025 Note 10 ); 
 making scheduled interest payments on our debt obligations (future interest payments total 1.2 billion, with 250.3 million due during the next 12 months; interest on unhedged variable-rate debt obligations was calculated using the applicable annual variable interest rates and balances outstanding at September 30, 2024); and 
 other normal recurring operating expenses. 
 
 We expect to fund these cash requirements through cash generated from operations, cash received from dispositions of properties, the use of our cash reserves or unused amounts on our Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (as described above), proceeds from term loans or other bank debt, issuances of common stock through our ATM Program Note 12 ), and potential issuances of additional debt or equity securities. We may also choose to prepay certain of our non-recourse mortgage loan obligations, depending on our capital needs and market conditions at that time. 
 
 Our liquidity could be adversely affected by unanticipated costs and greater-than-anticipated operating expenses. To the extent that our working capital reserve is insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, additional funds may be provided from cash from operations to meet our normal recurring short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We may also use existing cash resources, available capacity under our Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, mortgage loan proceeds, and the issuance of additional debt or equity securities to meet these needs. 
 
 Certain amounts disclosed above are based on the applicable foreign currency exchange rate at September 30, 2024.

Supplemental Financial Measures 
 
 In the real estate industry, analysts and investors employ certain non-GAAP supplemental financial measures in order to facilitate meaningful comparisons between periods and among peer companies. Additionally, in the formulation of our goals and in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our strategies, we use Funds from Operations FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP measures defined by our management. We believe that these measures are useful to investors to consider because they may assist them to better understand and measure the performance of our business over time and against similar companies. A description of FFO and AFFO and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided below. 
 
 Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations 
 
 Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has promulgated a non-GAAP measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure, when used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental non-GAAP measure. FFO is not equivalent to, nor a substitute for, net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 
 
 We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as restated in December 2018. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from the sale of certain real estate, impairment charges on real estate or other assets incidental to the company s main business, gains or losses on changes in control of interests in real estate, and depreciation and amortization from real estate assets; and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. 
 
 We also modify the NAREIT computation of FFO to adjust GAAP net income for certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of real estate-related intangibles, deferred income tax benefits and expenses, straight-line rent and related reserves, other non-cash rent adjustments, non-cash allowance for credit losses on loans receivable and finance leases, stock-based compensation, non-cash environmental accretion expense, amortization of discounts and premiums on debt, and amortization of deferred financing costs. Our assessment of our operations is focused on long-term sustainability and not on such non-cash items, which may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on cash flows. Additionally, we exclude non-core income and expenses, such as gains or losses from extinguishment of debt, merger and acquisition expenses, and spin-off expenses. We also exclude realized and unrealized gains/losses on foreign currency exchange rate movements (other than those realized on the settlement of foreign currency derivatives), which are not considered fundamental attributes of our business plan and do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. We refer to our modified definition of FFO as AFFO. We exclude these items from GAAP net income to arrive at AFFO as they are not the primary drivers in our decision-making process and excluding these items provides investors a view of our portfolio performance over time and makes it more comparable to other REITs that are currently not engaged in acquisitions, mergers, and restructuring, which are not part of our normal business operations. AFFO also reflects adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments. We use AFFO as one measure of our operating performance when we formulate corporate goals, evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies, and determine executive compensation. 
 
 We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider as we believe it will help them to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance without the potentially distorting impact of these short-term fluctuations. However, there are limits on the usefulness of AFFO to investors. For example, impairment charges and unrealized foreign currency losses that we exclude may become actual realized losses upon the ultimate disposition of the properties in the form of lower cash proceeds or other considerations. We use our FFO and AFFO measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance. We do not use our FFO and AFFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net income computed under GAAP, or as alternatives to net cash provided by operating activities computed under GAAP, or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.

 __________ 
 (a) Amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 represent a gain recognized on the remaining interest in an investment acquired during the third quarter of 2024, which we had previously accounted for under the equity method Note 7 ). 
 (b) Amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes a gain on sale of real estate of 176.2 million recognized upon the reclassification of a portfolio of 78 net-lease self-storage properties to net investments in sales-type leases. This portfolio was sold in the first quarter of 2024 Note 5 ). 
 (c) Equity income, including amounts that are not typically recognized for FFO and AFFO, is recognized within Earnings from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. This represents adjustments to equity income to reflect FFO and AFFO on a pro rata basis. 
 (d) Adjustments disclosed elsewhere in this reconciliation are on a consolidated basis. This adjustment reflects our FFO or AFFO on a pro rata basis. 
 (e) Primarily comprised of gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, the mark-to-market fair value of equity securities, and foreign currency exchange rate movements, as well as non-cash allowance for credit losses on loans receivable and finance leases. Amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include a mark-to-market unrealized loss for our investment in shares of Lineage of 43.6 million Note 8 ). 
 W. P. Carey 9/30/2024 10-Q 57 

(f) Amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily comprised of the write-off of a value added tax receivable that was previously recorded in connection with an international investment. Amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are primarily comprised of costs incurred in connection with the Spin-Off Note 1 ). 
 
 While we believe that FFO and AFFO are important supplemental measures, they should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of a company s operating performance. These non-GAAP measures should be used in conjunction with net income as defined by GAAP. FFO and AFFO, or similarly titled measures disclosed by other REITs, may not be comparable to our FFO and AFFO measures. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. The primary market risks that we are exposed to are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk; however, we do not use derivative instruments to hedge credit/market risks or for speculative purposes. 
 
 We are also exposed to further market risk as a result of tenant concentrations in certain industries and/or geographic regions, since adverse market factors can affect the ability of tenants in a particular industry/region to meet their respective lease obligations. In order to manage this risk, we view our collective tenant roster as a portfolio and we attempt to diversify such portfolio so that we are not overexposed to a particular industry or geographic region. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The values of our real estate and related fixed-rate debt obligations, as well as the values of our unsecured debt obligations, are subject to fluctuations based on changes in interest rates. The value of our real estate is also subject to fluctuations based on local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees, which may affect our ability to refinance property-level mortgage debt when balloon payments are scheduled, if we do not choose to repay the debt when due. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. An increase in interest rates would likely cause the fair value of our assets to decrease. Increases in interest rates may also have an impact on the credit profile of certain tenants. 
 
 We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. To limit this exposure, we generally seek long-term debt financing on a fixed-rate basis. However, we are subject to variable-rate interest on our Unsecured Term Loans, Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, and certain of our non-recourse mortgage debt. We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, interest rate swap agreements or interest rate cap agreements with counterparties related to certain of our variable-rate debt Note 10 ). See Note 9 for additional information on our interest rate swaps and caps. 
 
 Our debt obligations are more fully described in Note 10 and Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary of Financing in Item 2 above. The following table presents principal cash flows based upon expected maturity dates of our debt obligations outstanding at September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 2024 (Remainder) 
 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Fair Value Fixed-rate debt (a) (b) 
 7,261 681,635 1,560,704 570,246 634,372 3,722,278 7,176,496 6,806,235 Variable-rate debt (a) 
 27,878 602,554 229,607 860,039 891,300 
 __________ 
 (a) Amounts are based on the exchange rate at September 30, 2024, as applicable. 
 (b) Amounts include non-recourse mortgages and unsecured term loans subject to variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps. Amounts are primarily comprised of principal payments for our Senior Unsecured Notes Note 10 ). 
 
 The estimated fair value of our fixed-rate debt and our variable-rate debt is affected by changes in interest rates. Annual interest expense on our unhedged variable-rate debt that does not bear interest at fixed rates at September 30, 2024 would increase or decrease by 4.8 million for our euro-denominated debt, by 3.6 million for our British pound sterling-denominated debt, and by 0.2 million for our Japanese yen-denominated debt, for each respective 1 change in annual interest rates. 
 
 W. P. Carey 9/30/2024 10-Q 58 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 We own international investments, primarily in Europe, Canada, and Japan, and as a result are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements in various foreign currencies, primarily the euro, the British pound sterling, the Danish krone, the Canadian dollar, the Japanese yen, and certain other currencies which may affect future costs and cash flows. We have obtained, and may in the future obtain, non-recourse mortgage financing in the local currency. We have also completed several offerings of euro-denominated senior notes, and have borrowed under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and Unsecured Term Loan due 2026 in foreign currencies, including the euro, British pound sterling, and Japanese yen Note 10 ). Volatile market conditions arising from certain macroeconomic factors may result in significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To the extent that currency fluctuations increase or decrease rental revenues, as translated to U.S. dollars, the change in debt service (comprised of principal and interest, excluding balloon payments), as translated to U.S. dollars, will partially offset the effect of fluctuations in revenue and, to some extent, mitigate the risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We estimate that, for a 1 increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the euro, British pound sterling, or Danish krone and the U.S. dollar, there would be a corresponding change in the projected estimated cash flow (scheduled future rental revenues, net of scheduled future debt service payments for the next 12 months) for our consolidated foreign operations at September 30, 2024 of 2.3 million, 0.3 million, and 0.3 million, respectively, excluding the impact of our derivative instruments. 
 
 In addition, we may use currency hedging to further reduce the exposure to our equity cash flow. We are generally a net receiver of these currencies (we receive more cash than we pay out), and therefore our foreign operations benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar, relative to the foreign currency. 
 
 We enter into foreign currency collars to hedge certain of our foreign currency cash flow exposures. See Note 9 for additional information on our foreign currency collars. 
 
 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 
 Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of tenants are engaged in similar business activities or have similar economic risks or conditions that could cause them to default on their lease obligations to us. We regularly monitor our portfolio to assess potential concentrations of credit risk. While we believe our portfolio is well-diversified, it does contain concentrations in certain areas. There have been no material changes in our concentration of credit risk from what was disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures include internal controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in this and other reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the required time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. It should be noted that no system of controls can provide complete assurance of achieving a company s objectives and that future events may impact the effectiveness of a system of controls. 
 
 Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, after conducting an evaluation, together with members of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2024 at a reasonable level of assurance. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Parent Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and to the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment or extension, but in any event no less than three Business Days) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount and currency of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend or extend such Letter of Credit. In addition, as a condition to any such Letter of Credit issuance, the Parent Borrower shall have entered into a continuing agreement (or other letter of credit agreement) for the issuance of letters of credit and or shall submit a letter of credit application, in each case, as required by the Issuing Bank and using the Issuing Bank s standard form (each, a Letter of Credit Agreement ). In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any Letter of Credit Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment or extension of each Letter of Credit the Parent Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment or extension (i) (x) the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank at such time plus (y) the aggregate amount of all LC Disbursements made by the Issuing Bank that have not yet been reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrowers at such time shall not exceed its Letter of Credit Commitment, (ii) the LC Exposure shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, (iii) no Lender s Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed its Revolving Credit Commitment, (iv) the Total Revolving Credit Exposure plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Facility at such time, (v) the Outstanding Amount of Dollar Euro Tranche Loans plus the LC Exposure shall not exceed the Aggregate Dollar Euro Tranche Commitments, and (vi) the Outstanding Amount of the Dollar Euro Tranche Loans of any Revolving Credit Lender plus such Revolving Credit Lender s LC Exposure shall not exceed such Revolving Credit Lender s Dollar Euro Tranche Commitment. The Parent Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, reduce the Letter of Credit Commitment of the Issuing Bank with the consent of the Issuing Bank provided that the Parent Borrower shall not reduce the Letter of Credit Commitment of the Issuing Bank if, after giving effect of such reduction, the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (vi) above shall not be satisfied. 
 If the Parent Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Agreement, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit provided that any such Auto- 
 86 

Extension Letter of Credit must permit such Issuing Bank to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Non-Extension Notice Date in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the Issuing Bank, the Parent Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to Issuing Bank for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Credit Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the Issuing Bank to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the third anniversary of the Revolving Credit Maturity Date provided , however , that the Issuing Bank shall not permit any such extension if (A) the Issuing Bank has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof, or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Revolving Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Credit Lender or the Parent Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the Issuing Bank not to permit such extension. 
 The Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit if 
 (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank from issuing, amending or extending such Letter of Credit, or request that the Issuing Bank refrain from issuing, amending or extending such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to the Issuing Bank shall prohibit, the issuance, amendment or extension of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular, or any such order, judgment or decree, or law shall impose upon the Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital or liquidity requirement (for which the Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense that was not applicable on the Effective Date and that the Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it or 
 (ii) the issuance, amendment or extension of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally. 
 (c) Expiration Date . Each Letter of Credit shall expire (or be subject to termination by notice from the Issuing Bank to the beneficiary thereof) at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date three years after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any extension of the expiration date thereof, one year after such extension) and (ii) the date that is seven days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date provided that if the expiry date of any Letter of Credit (including any Auto-Extension Letter of Credit) would occur after the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the Parent Borrower hereby agrees that it will not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date (or, in the case of a Letter of Credit issued or extended 
 87 

on or after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, on the date of such issuance or extension, as applicable) cash collateralize or backstop such Letter of Credit as provided in Section 2.06(j). 
 (d) Participations . By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount or extending the term thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Dollar Euro Tranche Lender, and each Dollar Euro Tranche Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender s Dollar Euro Tranche Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Dollar Euro Tranche Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Issuing Bank, such Lender s Dollar Euro Tranche Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Parent Borrower (or the applicable Subsidiary) on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Parent Borrower (or any applicable Subsidiary) for any reason, including after the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. Each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Dollar Euro Tranche Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit and to make payments in respect of such acquired participations are absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments. 
 (e) Reimbursement . If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Parent Borrower shall (or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary to) reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount in the currency of such LC Disbursement equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12 00 noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Parent Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10 00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Parent Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12 00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the Parent Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt provided that if such LC Disbursement is denominated in Dollars, the Parent Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing in an equivalent amount (or in the case of LC Disbursements denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency), and, in each case, to the extent so financed, the Parent Borrower s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing. If the Parent Borrower fails to make such payment (or to cause the applicable Subsidiary to) when due, (x) without regard to the conditions to borrowing set forth in Section 4.02 (including the requirement to deliver a Borrowing Request pursuant to Section 2.03), the amount of such LC Disbursement (or in the case of LC Disbursements denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency) shall be automatically converted into an ABR Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars so long as, after giving effect to such ABR Borrowing, the 
 88 

Total Revolving Credit Exposure plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Facility at such time and (y) the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Parent Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender s Dollar Euro Tranche Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Dollar Euro Tranche Percentage of the payment then due from the Parent Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the respective Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Parent Borrower (or any applicable Subsidiary) pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Parent Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. 
 (f) Obligations Absolute . The Parent Borrower s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, any Letter of Credit Agreement or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Parent Borrower s obligations hereunder or (v) any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, document, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms, any error in translation or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Parent Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Parent Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Parent Borrower that are 
 89 

caused by the Issuing Bank s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. 
 (g) Disbursement Procedures . The Issuing Bank for any Letter of Credit shall, within the time allowed by applicable law or the specific terms of the Letter of Credit following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or electronic mail) of such demand for payment if the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder provided that such notice need not be given prior to payment by the Issuing Bank and any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Parent Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. 
 (h) Interim Interest . If the Issuing Bank for any Letter of Credit shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Parent Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full in the applicable currency on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the reimbursement is due and payable at the rate per annum then applicable to RFR Revolving Loans and such interest shall be due and payable on the date when such reimbursement is payable provided that, if the Parent Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank for such LC Disbursement shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. 
 (i) Replacement and Resignation of the Issuing Bank . (i) The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Parent Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (x) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and (y) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor 
 90 

or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of the Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or extend or otherwise amend any existing Letter of Credit. 
 (ii) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, the Issuing Bank may resign as the Issuing Bank at any time upon thirty days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Parent Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any such resignation, the Parent Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor Issuing Bank hereunder (subject to acceptance by such appointed successor Issuing Bank). 
 (j) Cash Collateralization . If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Parent Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50 of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Parent Borrower shall deposit in an account or accounts with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders (the Collateral Account ), an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure in the applicable currencies as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Parent Borrower described in Section 7.01(h) or (i). Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Parent Borrower under this Agreement. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing or paragraph (c) of this Section, if any LC Exposure remains outstanding after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, the Parent Borrower shall immediately deposit into the Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to the amount of such LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon or arrange for such Letter of Credit to be backstopped by a letter of credit, in form and substance, and from a letter of credit issuer, in each case, reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Bank. 
 The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Parent Borrower s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed, together with related fees, costs and customary processing charges, and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Parent Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50 of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy 
 91 

other Obligations. If the Parent Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Parent Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. 
 (k) Letters of Credit Issued for Account of Subsidiaries . Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder supports any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, or states that a Subsidiary is the account party, applicant, customer, instructing party, or the like of or for such Letter of Credit, and without derogating from any rights of the Issuing Bank (whether arising by contract, at law, in equity or otherwise) against such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit, the Parent Borrower (i) shall reimburse, indemnify and compensate the Issuing Bank hereunder for such Letter of Credit (including to reimburse any and all drawings thereunder) as if such Letter of Credit had been issued solely for the account of the Parent Borrower and (ii) irrevocably waives any and all defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor or surety of any or all of the obligations of such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit. The Parent Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of such Letters of Credit for its Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Parent Borrower, and that the Parent Borrower s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries. 
 Section 2.07. Funding of Borrowings . (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof solely by wire transfer of immediately available funds, by 12 00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05. Except in respect of the provisions of this Agreement covering the reimbursement of Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the funds so received in the aforesaid account of the Administrative Agent to an account of the applicable Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by the Parent Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request or Competitive Bid Request provided that RFR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank. 
 (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Parent Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the applicable Overnight Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry 
 92 

rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Parent Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans, or in the case of Alternative Currencies, in accordance with such market practice, in each case, as applicable. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. 
 Section 2.08. Interest Elections . (a) Each Revolving Borrowing and Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type and Agreed Currency specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Parent Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Parent Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Competitive Borrowings or Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued. 
 (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Parent Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Parent Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be signed by a Responsible Officer of the Parent Borrower. 
 (c) Each Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02 
 (i) the Agreed Currency and principal amount of Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing) 
 (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day 
 (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing (in the case of Borrowings denominated in Dollars) or a Term Benchmark Borrowing or an RFR Borrowing and 
 (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period . 
 93 

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Parent Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month s duration. 
 (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender s portion of each resulting Borrowing. 
 (e) If the Parent Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Term Benchmark Borrowing in Dollars prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be continued as a Term Benchmark Borrowing in Dollars with an Interest Period of one month at the end of such Interest Period. If the Parent Borrower fails to deliver a timely and complete Interest Election Request with respect to a Term Benchmark Borrowing in an Alternative Currency prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, then, unless such Term Benchmark Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, the Parent Borrower shall be deemed to have selected that such Term Benchmark Borrowing shall automatically be continued as a Term Benchmark Borrowing in its original Agreed Currency with an Interest Period of one month at the end of such Interest Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Parent Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Term Benchmark Borrowing or an RFR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, (x) (A) each Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (B) each RFR Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing immediately and (y) each Term Benchmark Borrowing and each RFR Borrowing, in each case denominated in an Alternative Currency shall bear interest at the Central Bank Rate (or in the case of (a) the Yen, the Japanese Prime Rate or (b) Canadian dollars, the Canadian Prime Rate) for the applicable Agreed Currency plus the CBR Spread provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate (or in the case of (a) the Yen, the Japanese Prime Rate or (b) Canadian dollars, the Canadian Prime Rate) for the applicable Agreed Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected Term Benchmark Loans denominated in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars shall either be (A) converted to an ABR Borrowing denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency) at the end of the Interest Period, as applicable, therefor or (B) prepaid at the end of the applicable Interest Period, as applicable, in full provided that if no election is made by the Parent Borrower by the earlier of (x) the date that is three Business Days after receipt by the Parent Borrower of such notice and (y) the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable Term Benchmark Loan, the Parent Borrower shall be deemed to have elected clause (A) above. 
 Section 2.09. Termination and Reduction of Commitments . (a) Unless previously terminated, (i) the Term A-1 Commitments and Term A-2 Commitments shall terminate at 5 00 
 94 

p.m., Local Time, on the Effective Date and (ii) the Revolving Credit Facility shall terminate on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. 
 (b) The Parent Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Credit Facility provided that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Credit Facility shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of the Dollar Equivalent of 1,000,000 and not less than the Dollar Equivalent of 5,000,000 and (ii) the Parent Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Credit Facility if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, any Lender s Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed its Revolving Credit Commitment. 
 (c) The Parent Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Credit Facility under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Parent Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable provided that a notice of termination of the Revolving Credit Facility delivered by the Parent Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or some other refinancing transaction, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Parent Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Revolving Credit Facility shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Credit Facility shall be made ratably among the Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments. 
 Section 2.10. Repayment of Loans Evidence of Debt . (a) (i) The Parent Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent (x) on the applicable Term Loan Maturity Date (A) for the account of the Term A-1 Lenders, the aggregate principal amount of all Term A-1 Loans outstanding on such date, and (B) for the account of the Term A-2 Lenders, the aggregate principal amount of all Term A-2 Loans outstanding on such date, (y) on the Euro Term Maturity Date, for the account of the Euro Term Lenders, the aggregate principal amount of all Euro Term Loans outstanding on such date, and (z) on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, for the account of the Revolving Credit Lenders, the then unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Loan outstanding on such date (ii) each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to repay each Competitive Loan made to such Borrower on the last day of the Interest Period in respect thereof and (iii) each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan made to such Borrower on the earlier of the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and the tenth Business Day after such Swingline Loan is made provided that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made, the Borrowers shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding and the proceeds of any such Revolving Borrowing shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to repay any Swingline Loans outstanding. 
 (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan 
 95 

made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. 
 (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender s share thereof. 
 (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
 (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by one or more promissory notes. In such event, the applicable Borrower(s) shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form.

 (b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or Issuing Bank s policies and the policies of such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
 (c) A certificate of a Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error provided that such Lender or such Issuing Bank shall not seek compensation under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section unless such Lender or such Issuing Bank is making such claims from similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities (to the extent such Lender or Issuing Bank has the right under such similar credit 
 106

 Section 2.17. Withholding of Taxes Gross-Up . 
 (a) Payments Free of Taxes . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Parent Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (e) Indemnification by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes 
 108 

attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to setoff and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e). 
 (f) Status of Lenders .

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
 (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Borrower is a U.S. Person, 
 (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent), an executed copy of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax

 (ii) (A) A Lender on the Effective Date that (x) holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme and (y) wishes such scheme to apply to this Agreement, shall provide its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence to each UK Borrower and the Administrative Agent and

 (A) each UK Borrower making a payment to such Lender has not made a Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of such Lender or 
 (B) each UK Borrower making a payment to such Lender has made a Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of such Lender but 
 (1) such Borrower DTTP Filing has been rejected by HM Revenue & Customs or 
 (2) HM Revenue & Customs has not given such UK Borrower authority to make payments to such Lender without a deduction for tax within 60 days of the date of such Borrower DTTP Filing 
 and in each case, such UK Borrower has notified that Lender in writing of either (1) or (2) above, then such Lender and such UK Borrower shall co-operate in completing any additional procedural formalities necessary for such UK Borrower to obtain authorization to make that payment without withholding or deduction for Taxes imposed under the laws of the United Kingdom.

the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 383 Madison Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the 
 113 

case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. 
 (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties. 
 (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and or participations in LC Disbursements and or Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against any Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
 (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received, prior to any date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank pursuant to the terms hereof or any other Loan Document (including any date that is fixed for prepayment by notice from the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of any Designated Borrower) to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.11(b)), notice from the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of any Designated Borrower) that the Borrower 
 114 

designated in such notice will not make such payment or prepayment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the applicable Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the applicable Overnight Rate. 
 Section 2.19. Mitigation Obligations Replacement of Lenders . (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Parent Borrower hereby agrees to pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
 (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender becomes Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Parent Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 2.15 or 2.17) and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment) provided that (i) the Parent Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Revolving Credit Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender) if such assignee is not a Lender, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) subject to the Parent Borrower s rights with respect to Defaulting Lenders under Section 2.20 hereof, such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Parent Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (iv) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a Lender s refusal to consent to a proposed amendment, 
 115 

modification, waiver, termination or consent, the assignee shall approve the proposed amendment, modification, waiver, termination or consent. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Parent Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that (A) an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Approved Electronic Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants), and (B) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to an be bound by the terms thereof provided that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender provided that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.

 116 

this Agreement or under any other Loan Document seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Parent Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Parent Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or LC Disbursements in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LC Disbursements owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LC Disbursements owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in the Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure and Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments without giving effect to clause (d) below.

 ARTICLE 10 Continuing Guaranty 
 Section 10.01. Guaranty . Each Guarantor, jointly and severally with the other Guarantors, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all of the Obligations, whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise, and whether arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, reasonable and documented attorneys fees and expenses incurred in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof) (for each Guarantor, subject to the proviso in this sentence, its Guaranteed Obligations provided that the liability of each Subsidiary Guarantor and each Guarantor that is a Designated Borrower individually with respect to this Guaranty shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law. The Administrative Agent s books and records showing the amount of the Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon the Guarantors, and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the 
 197 

Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing. 
 Section 10.02. Rights of Lenders . Each Guarantor consents and agrees that the Credit Parties may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, without the consent of such Guarantor, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, sell, or otherwise dispose of, or impair or fail to perfect any Lien on, any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Guaranteed Obligations (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders in their sole discretion may determine and (d) release or substitute any other Guarantor or one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of the Guarantors under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of one or more of the Guarantors. 
 Section 10.03. Certain Waivers . Each Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Credit Party) of the liability of any Borrower (other than the defense of prior payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations) (b) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of any Borrower (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor s liability hereunder (d) any requirement to proceed against any Borrower or any other Loan Party, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the power of any Credit Party whatsoever (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by any Credit Party and (f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses (other than the defense of prior payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations) or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties. Each Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations. 
 Section 10.04. Obligations Independent . The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, and a separate action may be brought against any Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not any Borrower or any other Person is joined as a party. For the avoidance of doubt, 
 198 

all obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty are joint and several obligations of all the Guarantors. 
 Section 10.05. Subrogation . No Guarantor shall exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full and the Commitments and the Facilities are terminated. If any amounts are paid to any Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust by such Guarantor for the benefit of the Credit Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Credit Parties to reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. 
 Section 10.06. Termination Reinstatement . This Guaranty is a continuing, absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are indefeasibly paid in full in cash and the Commitments and the Facilities with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations are terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of any Borrower or any Guarantor is made, or any of the Credit Parties exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any of the Credit Parties in their discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Credit Parties are in possession of or have released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The obligations of the Guarantors under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty. 
 Section 10.07. Subordination . Each Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of any Loan Party owing to such Guarantor, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of any Borrower to such Guarantor as subrogee of the Credit Parties or resulting from such Guarantor s performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations provided that such Guarantor may receive regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest on such obligations and indebtedness from any Borrower, except upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default. If any amounts are paid to any Guarantor in violation of the foregoing subordination, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Credit Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Credit Parties to reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, if the Credit Parties so request, any such obligation or indebtedness of any Borrower to any Guarantor shall be enforced and performance received by such Guarantor as trustee for the Credit Parties and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the Credit Parties on account of the 
 199 

Guaranteed Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of any Guarantor under this Guaranty. 
 Section 10.08. Stay of Acceleration . If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against any Borrower or any other Loan Party under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors immediately upon demand by the Credit Parties. 
 Section 10.09. Condition of Loan Parties . Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Loan Parties and any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Loan Parties and any such other guarantor as such Guarantor requires, and that none of the Credit Parties has any duty, and such Guarantor is not relying on the Credit Parties at any time, to disclose to such Guarantor any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of any Loan Party or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations (such Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Credit Parties to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same). 
 Section 10.10. Release of Subsidiary Guarantors that are not Intermediate Holding Companies . With respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor that is not an Intermediate Holding Company 
 (a) In the event that (i) all of the capital stock or other Equity Interests of such Subsidiary Guarantor is sold or otherwise disposed of in a transaction permitted by Section 6.04 (except to the extent that such sale or disposition is to a Borrower or any other Loan Party) or (ii) such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Section 5.12(a), then such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents provided that the Parent Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent, at least two Business Days prior to the date of the proposed release (or such shorter period of time as agreed to by the Administrative Agent in writing), a written request for release (a Guarantor Release Notice ), together with an certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Parent Borrower certifying that (x) in the case of clause (i) above, such sale or disposition is as a result of a transaction permitted under this Agreement and (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, as of the effective date of such release (as set forth in the Guarantor Release Notice) such Subsidiary Guarantor will no longer be required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to the requirements of Section 5.12(a). The Administrative Agent will (at the sole cost of the Borrowers) following receipt of such Guarantor Release Notice and certificate of a Responsible Officer, and each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to, execute and deliver such documents as the Parent Borrower or any such Subsidiary Guarantor may reasonably request to evidence the release of such Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, which documents shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
 (b) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of any such release hereunder, and this Agreement and each other Loan Document shall be deemed amended to delete the name of any Subsidiary Guarantor released pursuant to Section 10.10(a). 
 200 

Section 10.11. Contribution . At any time a payment in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is made under this Guaranty, the right of contribution of each Guarantor against each other Guarantor shall be determined as provided in the immediately following sentence, with the right of contribution of each Guarantor to be revised and restated as of each date on which a payment (a Relevant Payment is made on the Guaranteed Obligations under this Guaranty. At any time that a Relevant Payment is made by a Guarantor that results in the aggregate payments made by such Guarantor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment exceeding such Guarantor s Contribution Percentage (as defined below) of the aggregate payments made by all Guarantors in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment (such excess, the Aggregate Excess Amount ), each such Guarantor shall have a right of contribution against each other Guarantor who either has not made any payments or has made payments in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment in an aggregate amount less than such other Guarantor s Contribution Percentage of the aggregate payments made to and including the date of the Relevant Payment by all Guarantors in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations (the aggregate amount of such deficit, the Aggregate Deficit Amount in an amount equal to (x) a fraction the numerator of which is the Aggregate Excess Amount of such Guarantor and the denominator of which is the Aggregate Excess Amount of all Guarantors multiplied by (y) the Aggregate Deficit Amount of such other Guarantor. A Guarantor s right of contribution pursuant to the preceding sentences shall arise at the time of each computation, subject to adjustment at the time of each computation provided that no Guarantor may take any action to enforce such right until after all Guaranteed Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are indefeasibly paid in full in cash and the Commitments and the Facilities with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations are terminated, it being expressly recognized and agreed by all parties hereto that any Guarantor s right of contribution arising pursuant to this Section 10.11 against any other Guarantor shall be expressly junior and subordinate to such other Guarantor s obligations and liabilities in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and any other obligations owing under this Guaranty. As used in this Section 10.11, (i) each Guarantor s Contribution Percentage shall mean the percentage obtained by dividing (x) the Adjusted Net Worth (as defined below) of such Guarantor by (y) the aggregate Adjusted Net Worth of all Guarantors (ii) the Adjusted Net Worth of each Guarantor shall mean the greater of (x) the Net Worth (as defined below) of such Guarantor and (y) zero and (iii) the Net Worth of each Guarantor shall mean the amount by which the fair saleable value of such Guarantor s assets on the date of any Relevant Payment exceeds its existing debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities, but without giving effect to any Guaranteed Obligations arising under this Guaranty) on such date. All parties hereto recognize and agree that, except for any right of contribution arising pursuant to this Section 10.11, each Guarantor who makes any payment in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have no right of contribution or subrogation against any other Guarantor in respect of such payment until after all Guaranteed Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are indefeasibly paid in full in cash and the Commitments and the Facilities with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations are terminated. Each of the Guarantors recognizes and acknowledges that the rights to contribution arising hereunder shall constitute an asset in favor of the party entitled to such contribution. In this connection, each Guarantor has the right to waive its contribution right against any Guarantor to the extent 
 201 

that after giving effect to such waiver such Guarantor would remain Solvent, in the determination of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders. 
 Section 10.12. Release of Company . At any time the Company Release Conditions are satisfied, then the Company and the Intermediate Holding Companies shall be entitled to be released from their respective obligations under this Guaranty provided that the Company shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent, at least five Business Days prior to the date of the proposed release (or such shorter period of time as agreed to by the Administrative Agent in writing), a written notice of the Company s election, on behalf of itself and the Intermediate Holding Companies, to be released from their respective obligations under this Guaranty (a Company Release Notice ), together with a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Company certifying that as of the proposed effective date of such release (as set forth in the Guarantor Release Notice) and immediately before and after giving effect thereto, each of the Company Release Conditions are satisfied. The Administrative Agent will (at the sole cost of the Borrowers) following receipt of such Company Release Notice and certificate of a Responsible Officer, and each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to, execute and deliver such documents as the Company may reasonably request to evidence the release of the Company and the Intermediate Holding Companies from their respective obligations under this Guaranty, which documents shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of any such release pursuant to this Section 10.12. 
 
 202
