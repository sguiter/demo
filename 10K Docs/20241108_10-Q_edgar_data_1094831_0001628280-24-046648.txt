 operating partnerships of the Company. In addition, Newmark Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary of Newmark for which Newmark is the general partner. Newmark and Newmark Holdings jointly own Newmark OpCo, the operating partnership. Listed below are the limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings, prior to the Corporate Conversion, and Newmark Holdings. The FPUs, LPUs and limited partnership interests held by Cantor, each as described below, collectively represent all of the limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings, prior to the Corporate Conversion, and Newmark Holdings. The Corporate Conversion had no impact on Newmark and its organizational structure, nor any limited partnership interests, described below, held by BGC employees in Newmark Holdings. 
 As a result of the Separation, limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings were distributed to the holders of limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings, whereby each holder of BGC Holdings limited partnership interests at that time who held a BGC Holdings limited partnership interest received a corresponding Newmark Holdings limited partnership interest, determined by the Contribution Ratio, which was equal to a BGC Holdings limited partnership interest multiplied by one divided by , divided by the Exchange Ratio. Initially, the Exchange Ratio equaled , so that each Newmark Holdings limited partnership interest was exchangeable for share of Newmark Class A common stock. For reinvestment, acquisition or other purposes, Newmark may determine on a quarterly basis to distribute to its stockholders a smaller percentage than Newmark Holdings distributes to its equity holders (excluding tax distributions from Newmark Holdings) of cash that it received from Newmark OpCo. In such circumstances, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides that the Exchange Ratio will be reduced to reflect the amount of additional cash retained by Newmark as a result of the distribution of such smaller percentage, after the payment of taxes. The Exchange Ratio as of September 30, 2024 equaled .

 equal yearly installments after the holder s termination. There were none of these LPUs in BGC Holdings remaining after the Corporate Conversion was completed while these LPUs in Newmark Holdings held by BGC employees were not impacted by the Corporate Conversion. These LPUs held by BGC employees are accounted for as post-termination liability awards, and in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance, the Company records compensation expense for the awards based on the change in value at each reporting date in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.

 (which is per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. These allocations are deducted before the calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership interests and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holder. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into Class A common stock, and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution; accordingly, they are not included in the fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are reflected the same as those of the LPUs described above in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. After deduction of the Preferred Distribution, the remaining partnership units generally received quarterly allocations of net income based on their weighted-average pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain LPUs, such as PSUs, which may be granted exchangeability or redeemed in connection with the issuance of shares of common stock to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder, rather than issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes. 
 Cantor Units 
 Prior to the Corporate Conversion, Cantor held limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings. Cantor units were reflected as a component of Noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Cantor received allocations of net income (loss), which were cash distributed on a quarterly basis and were reflected as a component of Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of the Corporate Conversion, million Cantor units were converted into shares of BGC Group Class B common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the Corporate Conversion Agreement, provided that a portion of the million shares of BGC Group Class B common stock issued to Cantor will exchange into BGC Group Class A common stock in the event that BGC Group does not issue at least in shares of BGC Group Class A or B common stock in connection with certain acquisition transactions prior to the seventh anniversary of the Corporate Conversion. 
 General 
 Certain of the limited partnership interests, described above, were granted exchangeability into shares of BGC Class A common stock, prior to the Corporate Conversion, or shares of Newmark Class A common stock, and additional limited partnership interests could become exchangeable into shares of Newmark Class A common stock. In addition, prior to the Corporate Conversion, certain limited partnership interests were granted the right to exchange into or were exchanged into a partnership unit with a capital account, such as HDUs. HDUs had a stated capital account which was initially based on the closing trading price of Class A common stock at the time the HDU was granted. HDUs participated in quarterly partnership distributions and were generally not exchangeable into shares of Class A common stock. 
 Subsequent to the Spin-Off and prior to the Corporate Conversion, limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings held by a partner or Cantor could become exchangeable for BGC Class A or BGC Class B common stock on a -for-one basis. In addition, subsequent to the Spin-Off, limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings held by a partner or Cantor may become exchangeable for a number of shares of Newmark Class A or Newmark Class B common stock equal to the number of limited partnership interests multiplied by the then-current Exchange Ratio. Because limited partnership interests were included in the Company s fully diluted share count, if dilutive, prior to the Corporate Conversion, any previous exchanges of limited partnership interests into shares of BGC Class A or BGC Class B common stock did not impact the fully diluted number of shares and units outstanding. Because these limited partnership interests generally received quarterly allocations of net income, such exchanges had no significant impact on the cash flows or equity of BGC Partners, prior to the Corporate Conversion.

Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution (see Note 2 Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings for further information on Preferred Units). Subsequent to the Corporate Conversion, there are still BGC employees who hold limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings. These limited partnership interests represent interests that were held prior to the Newmark IPO and were distributed in connection with the Separation. Following the Newmark IPO, employees of BGC and Newmark only received limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings, respectively. As a result of the Spin-Off, as the previous limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings held by Newmark employees and the existing limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings held by BGC employees were/are exchanged/redeemed, the related capital was contributed to and from Cantor, respectively. The compensation expenses under GAAP related to the limited partnership interests are based on the company where the partner is employed. Therefore, compensation expenses related to the limited partnership interests of both BGC Holdings (prior to the Corporate Conversion) and Newmark Holdings that are held by BGC employees are recognized by BGC. The BGC Holdings limited partnership interests held by Newmark employees could have been included in the BGC share count and the Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests held by BGC employees may be included in the Newmark share count, if applicable. There were no limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings remaining upon the completion of the Corporate Conversion, and therefore, there was no compensation expense related to limited partnership interest in BGC Holdings recognized by BGC subsequent to the Corporate Conversion.

 Risk and Uncertainties 
 The Company generates revenues by providing financial intermediary and brokerage activities to institutional customers and by executing and, in some cases, clearing transactions for institutional counterparties. Revenues for these services are transaction-based. As a result, revenues could vary based on the transaction volume of global financial markets. Additionally, financing is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, which could have an impact on the Company s overall profitability. 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution which, at times, may exceed the FDIC maximum coverage limit of 250,000. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did t incur losses on any FDIC insured cash accounts. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company reserved losses and million, respectively, in connection with potential losses associated with Russia s Invasion of Ukraine. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company reserved million and million, respectively, in connection with potential losses associated with Russia s Invasion of Ukraine. These amounts are included in Other expenses in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and which was recorded as part of the allowance for credit losses (see Note 25 Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) for additional information). 
 Insurance 
 The Company is self-insured for health care claims, up to a stop-loss amount for eligible participating employees and qualified dependents in the U.S., subject to deductibles and limitations. The Company s liability for claims incurred but not reported is determined based on an estimate of the ultimate aggregate liability for claims incurred. The estimate is calculated from actual claim rates and adjusted periodically as necessary. The Company has accrued million and million in health care claims as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company does not expect health care claims to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 Guarantees 
 The Company provides guarantees to securities clearinghouses and exchanges which meet the definition of a guarantee under FASB interpretations. Under these standard securities clearinghouse and exchange membership agreements, members are required to guarantee, collectively, the performance of other members and, accordingly, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearinghouse or exchange, all other members would be required to meet the shortfall. In the opinion of management, the Company s liability under these agreements is not quantifiable and could exceed the cash and securities it has posted as collateral. However, the potential of being required to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, contingent liability has been recorded in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition for these agreements.

 years to years, some of which include options to extend the leases in to year increments for up to years. Renewal periods are included in the lease term only when renewal is reasonably certain, which is a high threshold and requires management to apply judgment to determine the appropriate lease term. Certain leases also include periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option. The Company measures its lease payments by including fixed rental payments and, where relevant, variable rental payments tied to an index, such as the Consumer Price Index. Payments for leases in place before the date of adoption of ASC 842, Leases, were determined based on previous leases guidance. The Company recognizes lease expense for its operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and variable lease expense not included in the lease payment measurement is recognized as incurred. Interest expense on finance leases is recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. 
 Pursuant to the accounting policy election, leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet. The short-term lease expense over the period reasonably reflects the Company s short-term lease commitments. 
 ASC 842 requires the Company to make certain assumptions and judgments in applying the guidance, including determining whether an arrangement includes a lease, determining the term of a lease when the contract has renewal or cancellation provisions, and determining the discount rate. 
 The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease or includes a lease at the contract inception by evaluating whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from, and can direct the use of, the identified asset for a period of time, the Company accounts for the identified asset as a lease. The Company has elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all leases other than real estate leases. The primary non-lease component that is combined with a lease component represents operating expenses, such as utilities, maintenance or management fees. 
 As the rate implicit in the lease is not usually available, the Company used an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption of ASC 842 in determining the present value of lease payments for existing leases. The Company has elected to use a portfolio approach for the incremental borrowing rate, applying corporate bond rates to the leases. The Company calculated the appropriate rates with reference to the lease term and lease currency. The Company uses information available at the lease commencement date to determine the incremental borrowing rate for any new leases. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any leases that have not yet commenced but that create significant rights and obligations.

Pursuant to the foregoing authorization, any existing agreements and arrangements between BGC Partners and any executive officer, director or affiliate of BGC Partners, were generally assumed unchanged, other than making BGC Group a party thereto. 
 In connection with the Corporate Conversion on July 1, 2023, the Board and Audit Committee of BGC Group approved the authorized repurchases of Company Equity Securities from any holder of Company Equity Securities, including our directors, officers, and employees, of up to 400.0 million.

 FMX 
 FMX includes the world s fastest growing cash U.S. Treasuries marketplace, FMX UST, and its spot foreign exchange platform, FMX FX, along with its newly launched U.S. interest rate futures exchange. FMX is challenging the CME s leading position in U.S. interest rate futures, cash U.S. Treasuries and spot foreign exchange. 
 In January 2024, FMX received CFTC approval to operate an exchange for U.S. interest rate futures products, the most widely traded futures contracts in the world. 
 The FMX Equity Partners contributed 171.7 million between April 23, 2024 and April 24, 2024 into FMX in exchange for a 25.75 ownership interest at a post-money equity valuation of 666.7 million. The FMX Equity Partners received an additional 10.3 of equity ownership subject to driving trading volumes and meeting certain volume targets across the FMX ecosystem. 
 On September 23, 2024 FMX Futures Exchange launched the trading of SOFR futures, the largest notional futures contract in the world. The FMX Futures Exchange launched with five FCMs, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Marex, RBC, and Wells Fargo. FMX expects to connect an additional five to ten of the largest FCMs for the launch of U.S. Treasury futures in the first quarter of 2025. 
 
 Fenics 
 For the purposes of this document and subsequent SEC filings, all of our higher margin, technology-driven businesses are referred to as Fenics. We categorize our Fenics businesses as Fenics Markets and Fenics Growth Platforms. Fenics Markets includes the Fully Electronic portion of BGC s brokerage businesses, data, network and post-trade revenues that are unrelated to Fenics Growth Platforms, as well as Fenics Integrated revenues. Fenics Growth Platforms includes FMX UST, Fenics GO, Lucera, FMX FX, PortfolioMatch and other newer standalone platforms. Revenues generated from data, network and post-trade attributable to Fenics Growth Platforms are included within their related businesses. 
 Historically, technology-based product growth has led to higher margins and greater profits over time for exchanges and wholesale financial intermediaries alike, even if overall Company revenues remain consistent. This is largely because automated and electronic trading efficiency allows the same number of employees to manage a greater volume of trades as the marginal cost of incremental trading activity falls. Over time, the conversion of exchange-traded and OTC markets to Fully Electronic trading has also typically led to an increase in volumes which offset lower commissions, and often lead to similar or higher overall revenues. We have been a pioneer in creating and encouraging Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution, and continually work with our customers to expand such trading across more asset classes and geographies.

Table of Contents 

 These electronic markets for OTC products have grown as a percentage of overall industry volumes over the past decade as firms like BGC have invested in the kinds of technology favored by our customers. Regulation across banking, capital markets, and OTC derivatives has accelerated the adoption of Fully Electronic execution, and we expect this demand to continue. We also believe that new clients, beyond our large bank customer base, will primarily transact electronically across our Fenics platforms. 
 The combination of wider adoption of Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution and our competitive advantage in terms of technology and experience has contributed to our strong growth in electronically traded products. We continue to invest in our high-growth, high-margin, technology-driven businesses, including our standalone Fully Electronic Fenics Growth Platforms. Fenics has exhibited strong growth over the past several years, and we believe that this growth has outpaced the wholesale brokerage industry. We expect this trend to accelerate as we continue to convert more of our Voice/Hybrid execution into higher-margin, technology-driven execution across our Fenics platforms and continue to grow our Fenics Growth Platforms. 
 We expect to benefit from the trend towards electronic trading, increased demand for market data, and the need for increased connectivity, automation, and post-trade services. We continue to onboard new customers as the opportunities created by electronic and algorithmic trading continue to transform our industry. We continue to roll out our next-generation Fenics execution platforms across more products and geographies with the goal of seamlessly integrating the liquidity of Voice transactions with customer electronic orders either by a GUI, API, or web-based interface. 
 Revenues in our Fenics businesses increased 13.3 , to 142.1 million, and 9.7 , to 428.7 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. 
 Within our Fenics businesses, Fenics Markets revenue grew 9.2 , to 116.8 million, in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year period. Fenics Markets growth was driven by higher electronic volumes across Rates and Foreign Exchange. 
 Fenics Growth Platforms revenue grew 37.3 , to 25.3 million, in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by FMX, PortfolioMatch and Lucera. Collectively, our newer Fenics Growth Platform offerings are not yet fully up to scale, but continue to grow at a leading rate compared with other electronic trading platforms. Over time, we expect these new products and services to become profitable, high-margin businesses as their scale and revenues increase, all else equal. 
 We continue to invest in our Fenics Growth Platforms, and notable highlights for the third quarter of 2024 include: 
 FMX UST generated record ADV of 53 billion for the third quarter, up 40 from third quarter of 2023. This translated into 29.4 market share for the third quarter, compared to 25.3 a year ago. 
 FMX FX average daily volumes improved by over 38 compared to last year on record ADV of over 9 billion. FMX FX continues to outperform and grow its market share in the enormous global foreign exchange market. 
 PortfolioMatch U.S. credit volumes increased more than 150 and its European volumes were up over nine-fold compared to last year. 
 Lucera, our network business providing critical real-time trading infrastructure to the capital markets, grew its revenue by over 34 . Lucera is leveraging its strength in the FX markets and expanding across the Rates landscape. 
 Total revenues from our high-margin Data, network and post-trade business, which is predominately comprised of recurring revenue, increased by 17.5 , to 32.7 million, and increased by 15.2 , to 94.4 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. 
 Data, network and post-trade revenue growth for the third quarter of 2024 was driven by strong subscription-based revenue growth across Fenics Market Data and Lucera.

 Acquisitions 
 On October 22, 2024, the Company announced that it had executed a definitive agreement to acquire OTC Global. At the closing of the proposed acquisition of OTC Global, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2025, the Company expects to acquire OTC Global in a substantially all cash transaction. The closing of the proposed acquisition of OTC Global is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. 
 On October 1, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Sage Energy Partners, an energy and environmental brokerage firm. This acquisition will expand BGC s energy brokerage services in the U.S. and support BGC s global growth efforts across ECS. 
 Both the Sage Energy Partners acquisition and the anticipated acquisition of OTC Global are expected to be immediately accretive. 
 On November 1, 2023 the Company completed the acquisition of ContiCap, an independent financial product intermediary specializing in emerging markets.

 Other Matters 
 In February 2022, the U.S., U.K., EU, and other countries imposed sanctions on Russian counterparties, and as a result BGC has ceased trading with those clients. The Company derived less than 1 of total revenue from its Moscow branch and sanctioned Russian counterparties. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reserved no losses and 4.0 million, respectively, in connection with unsettled trades and receivables with sanctioned Russian entities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reserved 2.0 million and 6.0 million, respectively, in connection with unsettled trades and receivables with sanctioned Russian entities. 
 
 Tax Policy Changes 
 On August 16, 2022, the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new corporate alternative minimum tax based on 15 of adjusted financial statement income for applicable corporations. The IR Act also provides for a new U.S. federal 1 excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded U.S. corporations and certain U.S. subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself and not its stockholders from which the shares are repurchased. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. These tax provisions of the IR Act were effective January 1, 2023. The IR Act and related regulatory developments did not have a material impact on our financial statements nor is it expected to have a material impact in future periods.

 On July 1, 2021, the OECD released a statement on the Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising From the Digitalization of the Economy, reflecting the agreement of 130 of the member jurisdictions of the Inclusive Framework on some key parameters with respect to Pillars I and II. The objective is to introduce a global minimum tax rate of 15 applicable to multinational groups with global book revenue in excess of EUR 750 million. The tax has the effect of increasing the ETR to 15 in jurisdictions where the ETR calculated under the GloBE Rules is under 15 . In December 2022, the Council of the EU unanimously adopted the EU Minimum Tax Directive, which would require member states to implement these rules. Due to complexities in applying the legislation and calculating income under the GloBE Rules, the detailed quantitative impact of the enacted or substantively enacted legislation is not yet reasonably estimable. Management performed an analysis of the potential impact of the Pillar Two provisions on its multinational activities. Based on that analysis, management does not believe that the Pillar Two tax regime will result in a material increase to its tax expense. Management will continue to evaluate the potential impact the Pillar Two Framework may have on the future results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Financial Services Industry 
 The financial services industry has grown historically due to several factors. One factor was the increasing use of derivatives to manage risk or to take advantage of the anticipated direction of a market by allowing users to protect gains and/or guard against losses in the price of underlying assets without having to buy or sell the underlying assets. Derivatives are often used to mitigate the risks associated with interest rates, equity ownership, changes in the value of FX, credit defaults by corporate and sovereign debtors, and changes in the prices of commodity products. Over this same timeframe, demand from financial institutions, large corporations and other end-users of financial products have increased volumes in the wholesale derivatives market, thereby increasing the business opportunity for financial intermediaries. 
 Another key factor in the historical growth of the financial services industry has been the increase in the number of new financial products. As market participants and their customers strive to mitigate risk, new types of equity and fixed income securities, futures, options and other financial instruments have been developed. Most of these new securities and derivatives were not immediately ready for more liquid and standardized electronic markets, and generally increased the need for trading and required broker-assisted execution. 
 Due largely to the impacts of the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, our businesses had faced more challenging market conditions from 2009 until the second half of 2016. Accommodative monetary policies were enacted by several major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, in response to the global financial crises. These policies resulted in historically low levels of volatility and interest rates across many of the financial markets in which we operate. The global credit markets also faced structural issues, such as increased bank capital requirements under Basel III. Consequently, these factors contributed to lower trading volumes in our Rates and Credit asset classes across most geographies in which we operated. 
 From mid-2016 until the first quarter of 2020, the overall financial services industry benefited from sustained economic growth, lower unemployment rates in most major economies, higher consumer spending, the modification or repeal of certain U.S. regulations, and higher overall corporate profitability. The trend towards digitization and electronification within the industry contributed to higher overall volumes and transaction count in Fully Electronic execution. From the second quarter of 2020 onward, concerns about the future trade relationship between the U.K. and the EU after Brexit, a slowdown in global growth driven by the outbreak of COVID-19, and an increase in trade protectionism were tempered by monetary and fiscal stimulus. During 2021, as the global economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, higher inflation across the U.S. and other G8 countries led many central banks to begin and/or announce tapering and unwinding of asset purchases under quantitative easing programs, as well as implement multiple interest rate hikes. 
 During the fourteen years between 2008 and 2022, BGC and the entire financial service industry s trading volumes were constrained by low interest rates and quantitative easing. Manufactured zero and near-zero interest rates caused the breakdown and disappearance of the historic correlation between issuance and trading volume growth. The change in central bank monetary policies away from zero interest rates, following the highest inflation in decades, together with meaningful interest rates set the stage for a resurgence in secondary market trading volumes for rates, credit and foreign exchange.We believe the return of this strong positive correlation in the current macro trading environment, which has meaningful interest rates and issuance that is multiples above 2008 levels, positions BGC to benefit and drive its trading volumes, revenue and profitability higher for the foreseeable future.

 Recent Developments 
 On March 4, 2024, the Company announced that it would be joining the S P SmallCap 600 Index, with the inclusion taking effect before trading commenced on March 18, 2024. The S P SmallCap 600 is designed to track the performance of the small-cap sector of the U.S. stock market. 
 
 Brexit 
 On January 1, 2021, the U.K. formally left the EU and U.K.-EU trade became subject to a new agreement that was concluded in December of 2020. The exit from the EU is commonly referred to as Brexit. Financial services fall outside of the scope of this trade agreement. At the time, the relationship was expected to be determined by a series of equivalence decisions, each of which would grant mutual market access for a limited subset of financial services where either party finds the other party has a regulatory regime that achieves similar outcomes to its own. In March 2021, the U.K. and EU entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on Financial Services Regulatory Cooperation which creates a structure for dialogue but does not include commitments on equivalence. 
 In light of ongoing uncertainties, market participants are still adjusting the way in which they conduct business between the U.K. and EU. The impact of Brexit on the U.K.-EU flow of financial services and economies of the U.K. and the EU member states continues to evolve. 
 We have implemented measures to ensure continuity of service in Europe and continue to have regulated offices in place in many of the major European markets. As part of our ongoing Brexit strategy, ownership of BGC Madrid, Copenhagen and Frankfurt and GFI Paris, Madrid and Dublin branches were transferred to Aurel BGC SAS (a French-based operation and therefore based in the EU) in July 2020. We have been generally increasing our footprint in the EU, including the establishment of a new branch office of Aurel BGC SAS in Milan, and a new office in Monaco under a new local Monaco subsidiary. 
 Regardless of these and other mitigating measures, our European headquarters and largest operations are in London, and market access risks and uncertainties have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our customers, counterparties, business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, in the future the U.K. and EU s regulation may further diverge, which could disrupt and increase the costs of our operations, and result in a loss of existing levels of cross-border market access. 
 
 Regulation 
 Regulators in the U.S. have finalized most of the new rules across a range of financial marketplaces, including OTC derivatives, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Many of these rules became effective in prior years, while ongoing phase-ins are anticipated over coming years. 
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., legislators and regulators in Europe have crafted similar rules: MiFID II, which made sweeping changes to market infrastructure, European Market Infrastructure Regulation, which focused specifically on derivatives, and Capital Requirements Directive IV for prudential standards. Over the past few years, European policymakers have launched various reviews of post-financial crisis legislation, leading to legislative updates such as EMIR Regulatory Fitness and Performance and CRD V. In May 2019, the European Securities Market Authority produced a report on proposals to further enhance the harmonization and standardization of derivatives reporting under EMIR, known as EMIR Refit. These proposals require significant changes to the content and format of trade and transaction reporting systems across the industry. The go-live date for these changes was April 29, 2024 for Europe and was September 30, 2024 for the U.K. We are in compliance with the reporting enhancements. Furthermore, regulators have introduced a new prudential regime tailored specifically to investment firms such as our firm the Investment Firm Review. These rules continue to alter the environment in which we operate. We note that various internal and external factors have made the EU more rigid in its regulatory approach to non-EU countries, which could impact the ease with which the global financial system is connected.

 By the end of 2024, a new European Commission is expected to take office which may, over the course of its five-year mandate, introduce new legislative proposals for the Financial Services Sector and change the Brexit landscape for EU and U.K. financial firms alike. We are unable to predict how any of these new laws and proposed rules and regulations in the U.S., the EU or the U.K. will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or rules and regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof or a relaxation or other amendment of existing rules and regulations, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including important changes in market infrastructure, increased reporting costs and a potential rearrangement in the sources of available revenue in a more transparent market. Certain enhanced regulations could subject us to the risk of fines, sanctions, enhanced oversight, increased financial or capital requirements and additional restrictions or limitations on our ability to conduct or grow our businesses, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of such new rules and regulations may negatively impact our customers and trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact, although a relaxation of existing rules and requirements could potentially have a positive impact in certain markets. Increased capital requirements may also diminish transaction velocity. 
 BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, our subsidiaries, operate as SEFs. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons for made available to trade products and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been implemented. We also own ELX, which became a dormant contract market on July 1, 2017, and in July 2021 we completed the purchase of the CX Futures Exchange (now FMX Futures Exchange) from Cantor, which represents our futures exchange and related clearinghouse. These rules require authorized execution facilities to maintain robust front-end and back-office IT capabilities and to make large and ongoing technology investments. These execution facilities may be supported by a variety of Voice and auction-based execution methodologies, and our Hybrid and Fully Electronic trading capability have performed strongly in this regulatory environment. 
 On June 25, 2020, the CFTC approved a final rule prohibiting post-trade name give-up for swaps executed, prearranged or pre-negotiated anonymously on or pursuant to the rules of a SEF and intended to be cleared. The rule provides exemptions for package transactions that include a component transaction that is not a swap that is intended to be cleared. The rule went into effect on November 1, 2020 for swaps subject to the trade execution requirement under the Commodity Exchange Act Section 2(h)(8) and July 5, 2021 for swaps not subject to the trade execution requirement but intended to be cleared. 
 On November 2, 2023, the SEC adopted Regulation SE under the Exchange Act to create a regime for the registration and regulation of SBSEFs. The SEC rules regarding the over-the-counter derivatives market seek to harmonize as closely as practicable with parallel rules of the CFTC that govern SEFs and swap execution generally. Among other things, Regulation SE under the Exchange Act made changes to implement the Exchange Act s trade execution requirement for security-based swaps and address the cross-border application of that requirement; implement Section 765 of the Dodd-Frank Act to mitigate conflicts of interest at SBSEFs and national securities exchanges that trade security-based swaps; and promote consistency between proposed Regulation SE and existing rules under the Exchange Act. Any entity that meets the definition of a SBSEF must file an application to register with the SEC within 180 days of the effective date of February 13, 2024. 
 The SEC also adopted final rules on December 13, 2023 regarding central clearing of certain secondary market repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions and secondary market purchase and sale transactions involving U.S. Treasury securities. The central clearing mandate will impact certain market participants who do not clear today, and some have expressed concerns about the potential impact of additional clearing costs on liquidity. The full impact of this change, whether positive or negative, on our industry, our clients or us is unknown at this time. 
 On October 25, 2024, the SEC adopted rule amendments and a new rule to improve the resilience and recovery and wind-down planning of covered clearing agencies. The rule amendments establish new requirements regarding a covered clearing agency s collection of intraday margin as well as a covered clearing agency s reliance on substantive inputs to its risk-based margin model. The new rule prescribes requirements for the contents of a covered clearing agency s recovery and wind-down plan. The full impact of this change, whether positive or negative, on our industry, our clients or us is unknown at this time.

 On February 6, 2024, the SEC adopted under Exchange Act Rules 3a5-4 and 3a44-2, which expanded the definitions of dealer and government securities dealer under the Exchange Act to cover additional market participants engaged in liquidity-providing activities. The final rules were published in the Federal Register on February 29, 2024, are effective as of April 29, 2024 with a compliance deadline one year later on April 29, 2025. These rules provide a new standard for determining what it means for a person's securities activities to be conducted as a part of a regular business within the definitions of dealer and government securities dealer, essentially capturing market participants who regularly express trading interest on both sides of the market and earn revenue primarily from bid-ask spreads. This new standard requires such market participants to register as dealers if they meet the criteria. This may have an impact on some of our clients; however, it is not expected to materially affect us or our operational workflows. 
 In addition, several state-level laws in the U.S. that have recently come into effect, and may come into effect in the future, have created and will create new compliance obligations in relation to personal data. 
 See Regulation included in Part I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information related to our regulatory environment. 
 
 Industry Consolidation 
 Over the past decade, there has been significant consolidation among the interdealer-brokers and wholesale brokers with which we compete. We continue to compete with the electronic markets, post-trade and information businesses of the CME through the various offerings on our Fenics platform, which includes FMX. We will also continue to compete with TP ICAP and Tradition across various Voice/Hybrid brokerage marketplaces as well as via Fenics. 
 Additionally, there has been an increase in acquisitions of OTC trading platforms by exchanges and electronic marketplaces, such as ICE buying BondPoint and TMC Bonds, Deutsche B rse buying 360T, CBOE buying Hotspot, MarketAxess buying LiquidityEdge, Tradeweb buying Nasdaq s U.S. Fixed Income Electronic Trading Platform, r8fin and ICD, LSEG acquiring Quantile, etc. We view the recent consolidation in the industry favorably, as we expect it to provide additional operating leverage to our businesses in the future. 
 
 Growth Drivers 
 As a wholesale intermediary in the financial services industry, our businesses are driven primarily by secondary trading volumes in the markets in which we broker, the size and productivity of our front-office personnel, regulatory issues, and the percentage of our revenues we are able to generate by Fully Electronic means. BGC s revenues tend to have low correlation in the short- and medium-term with global bank and broker-dealer sales and trading revenues, which reflect bid-ask spreads and mark-to-market movements, as well as industry volumes in both the primary and secondary markets. 
 Below is a brief analysis of the market and industry volumes for some of our products, including our overall Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution activities. 
 
 Overall Market Volumes and Volatility 
 Volume is driven by a number of factors, including the level of issuance for financial instruments, price volatility of financial instruments, macro-economic conditions, creation and adoption of new products, regulatory environment, and the introduction and adoption of new trading technologies. Historically, increased price volatility has often increased the demand for hedging instruments, including many of the cash and derivative products that we broker. 
 Rates volumes in particular are influenced by market volumes and, in certain instances, volatility. Historically low and negative interest rates, as well as central bank quantitative easing programs, across the globe significantly reduced the overall trading appetite for rates products. Such programs depressed rates volumes because they entail central banks buying government securities or other securities in the open market in an effort to promote increased lending and liquidity and bring down long-term interest rates. When central banks hold these instruments, they tend not to trade or hedge, thus lowering rates volumes across cash and derivatives markets industry-wide. Following the market dislocation and pandemic, major central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, ECB, Bank of Japan, Bank of England, and Swiss National Bank restarted quantitative easing programs in 2020. Beginning in 2022 inflationary concerns have resulted in rising interest rates and tapering and/or unwinding of central bank asset purchases. The return of interest rates has led to improved macro trading conditions which has benefited BGC. This improved backdrop is expected to support both BGC s Fenics and Voice/Hybrid businesses for the foreseeable future.

 Additional factors have weighed on market volumes in the products we broker. For example, the Basel III accord, implemented in late 2010 by the G-20 central banks, is a global regulatory framework on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk that was developed with the intention of making banks more stable in the wake of the financial crisis by increasing bank liquidity and reducing bank leverage. The accord, which took effect on January 1, 2023, requires most large banks in G-20 nations to hold approximately three times as much Tier 1 capital as was required under the previous set of rules. These capital rules have made it more expensive for banks to hold non-sovereign debt assets on their balance sheets, and as a result, analysts say that banks have reduced their proprietary trading activity in corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities as well as in various other OTC cash and derivative instruments. We believe that this has further reduced overall market exposure and industry volumes in many of the products we broker, particularly in Credit. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, industry volumes were generally higher across Rates, ECS, FX, Credit, and Equities compared to the prior year period. BGC s brokerage revenues were up by 15.1 year-on-year in the quarter, reflecting broad-based growth across all geographies and strong double-digit revenue growth across BGC s three largest asset classes, Rates, ECS and FX. 
 Below is an expanded discussion of the volume and growth drivers of our various brokerage product categories. 
 
 Rates Volumes and Volatility 
 Our Rates business is influenced by a number of factors, including global sovereign issuances, interest rates, central bank policies, secondary trading and the hedging of these sovereign debt instruments. The amount of global sovereign debt outstanding remains at historically high levels; the level of secondary trading and related hedging activity was higher during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period. According to Bloomberg and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Primary Dealer average daily volume of U.S. Government Securities was up 26 compared to the prior year period. Over the same time period, listed products on CME were up 36 , while OTC interest rate derivative volumes traded on SEF were up 41 compared to the third quarter of 2023, according to Clarus Financial Technology. In comparison, our overall Rates revenues were up 19.6 , as compared to a year earlier, to 174.3 million. 
 Our Rates revenues, like the revenues for most of our products, are not fully dependent on market volumes and, therefore, do not always fluctuate consistently with industry metrics. This is largely because our Voice, Hybrid, and Fully Electronic Rates desks often have volume discounts built into their price structure, which results in our Rates revenues being less volatile than the overall industry volumes. 
 Overall, analysts and economists expect the absolute level of sovereign debt outstanding to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future as governments finance their future deficits and roll over their sizable existing debt. Additionally, yields on government bonds have steadily increased in 2022 and 2023, which gave rise to increased volatility and higher demand to hedge interest rate exposure. Recent and potential future monetary policy changes by major central banks have given rise to higher levels of interest rate trading activity and are expected to provide continued tailwinds to our Rates business. 
 
 ECS Volumes 
 ECS volumes were higher during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period. CME and ICE energy futures and options volumes were up 21 and 23 , respectively, compared to the prior year period. In comparison, BGC s ECS revenues increased 21.3 , compared to the prior year period, to 112.9 million. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Volumes and Volatility 
 Global FX volumes were higher during the third quarter of 2024. Volumes for CME EBS spot FX was up 23 , while Euronext FX was up 17 , during the quarter compared to the prior year period. In comparison, our overall FX revenues increased by 15.4 , compared to the prior year period, to 92.1 million.

 Credit Volumes 
 Our Credit business is impacted by the level of global corporate bond issuance and interest rates. Credit volumes were higher during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period. FINRA TRACE average daily volume for U.S. Investment Grade was up 38 and U.S. High Yield was up 25 according to Bloomberg. In comparison, our overall Credit revenues increased by 6.7 , compared to the prior year period, to 68.0 million. 
 
 Equities Volumes 
 Global equity volumes were generally higher during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period. According to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or SIFMA, the average daily volume of U.S. cash equities traded was up 10 as compared to a year earlier. Over the same timeframe, Eurex average daily volumes of equity and equity index derivatives were up 4 , and according to the OCC, the average daily volume of U.S. options was up 12 . BGC s equity business primarily consists of equity derivatives. Our overall revenues from Equities increased by 1.3 , compared to the prior year period, to 53.3 million. 
 
 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
 See Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information related to our regulatory environment. 
 
 LIQUIDITY 
 See Liquidity and Capital Resources herein for information related to our Liquidity and capital resources. 
 
 HIRING 
 Key drivers of our revenue are front-office producer headcount and average revenue per producer. We believe that our strong technology platform and unique compensation structure have enabled us to use both acquisitions and recruiting to uniquely position us to be able to outperform our peer group. 
 We have invested significantly through acquisitions and the hiring of new brokers, salespeople, managers, technology professionals and other front-office personnel. The business climate for these acquisitions has been competitive, and it is expected that these conditions will persist for the foreseeable future. We have been able to attract businesses and brokers, salespeople, managers, technology professionals and other front-office personnel to our platform as we believe they recognize that we have the scale, technology, experience and expertise to succeed. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our front-office headcount was 2,121 brokers, salespeople, managers, technology professionals and other front-office personnel, up 4.2 from 2,036 a year ago. Compared to the prior year, average revenue per front-office employee for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 10.6 , to 0.3 million. 
 The laws and regulations passed or proposed on both sides of the Atlantic concerning OTC trading seem likely to favor increased use of technology by all market participants, and are likely to accelerate the adoption of both Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution. We believe these developments will favor the larger inter-dealer brokers over smaller, non-public local competitors, as the smaller players generally do not have the financial resources to invest the necessary amounts in technology. We believe this will lead to further consolidation across the wholesale financial brokerage industry, and thus allow us to grow profitably.

 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Income from operations before income taxes was 19.7 million compared to 23.9 million in the prior year period. 
 Total revenues increased 78.4 million compared to the prior year period, or 16.2 , to 561.1 million, largely due to growth of 15.1 in our brokerage revenues, driven by strong growth across each of our asset classes: 
 Rates increased 28.6 million, or 19.6 ; 
 ECS increased 19.8 million, or 21.3 ; 
 FX increased 12.3 million, or 15.4 ; 
 Credit increased 4.3 million, or 6.7 ; and 
 Equities increased 0.7 million, or 1.3 . 
 In addition, there was an increase of 4.9 million, or 17.5 , in Data, network and post-trade revenues, primarily driven by strong subscription-based revenue growth across Fenics Market Data and our Lucera network business. Furthermore, there was an increase of 6.8 million in Interest and dividend income, primarily driven by income earned on borrowings by Cantor under the BGC Credit Agreement, employee loans and government bonds. The increase in BGC revenues also reflects broad-based growth across all geographies the Americas, EMEA, and APAC grew by 19.0 , 16.5 , and 8.3 , respectively. 
 Total expenses increased 83.1 million, or 17.9 , to 548.0 million. There was a 54.6 million increase in total compensation expenses primarily driven by an increase in equity-based compensation and higher commission revenues on variable compensation. The 28.5 million increase in non-compensation expenses was primarily driven by increases in consulting and other professional fees, increases in Occupancy and equipment related to costs for exiting a lease and software licenses, and increases in Interest expense related to the BGC Group 6.600 Senior Notes issued June 10, 2024. These higher interest expenses were partially offset by lower interest due to the repayment in full of the BGC Partners 5.375 Senior Notes on July 24, 2023. Overall, the higher interest expense was more than offset by higher interest income during the period. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Income from operations before income taxes of 146.0 million compared to 25.8 million for the same period in the prior year. 
 Total revenues increased 181.8 million, or 12.1 , to 1,690.5 million, largely due to growth of 11.0 in our brokerage revenues: 
 ECS increased 67.7 million, or 24.0 , 
 Rates increased 60.8 million, or 13.4 ; 
 FX increased 27.6 million, or 11.6 ; 
 Credit increased 5.9 million, or 2.7 ; and 
 Equities decreased 10.6 million, or 5.9 . 
 In addition, there was an increase of 12.5 million, or 15.2 , in Data, network and post-trade revenues, primarily driven by strong revenue growth across Fenics Market Data, our Lucera network business and our Capitalab post-trade business, as a result of expanding both our client base and our offerings. Furthermore, there was an increase of 15.0 million in Interest and dividend income, primarily driven by income earned on money market funds, government bonds, borrowings by Cantor under the BGC Credit Agreement, and employee loans. 
 Total expenses increased 105.7 million, or 7.1 , to 1,596.3 million. There was a 61.1 million increase in total compensation expenses, which was primarily driven by higher commissionable revenues on variable compensation, and an increase in headcount. These higher compensation expenses were partially offset by a 29.3 million decrease in equity-based compensation, which was primarily a result of a 60.9 million charge for the redemption of certain non-exchangeable limited partnership units in connection with the issuance of shares of BGC Group Class A common stock and the accompanying tax payments related to the Corporate Conversion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 44.5 million increase in non-compensation expenses was primarily driven by increases in Interest expense related to the BGC Partners 8.000 Senior Notes issued on May 24, 2023, the BGC Group 6.600 Senior Notes issued June 10, 2024, and borrowings on both the Revolving Credit Agreement and BGC Credit Agreement. These higher interest expenses were partially offset by lower interest due to the repayment in full of the BGC Partners 5.375 Senior Notes on July 24, 2023.

 Revenues 
 Brokerage Revenues 
 Total brokerage revenues increased by 65.6 million, or 15.1 , to 500.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Commission revenues increased by 56.8 million, or 16.2 , to 407.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Principal transactions revenues increased by 8.8 million, or 10.4 , to 93.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our brokerage revenues from Rates increased by 28.6 million, or 19.6 , to 174.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting higher volumes across the business. 
 Our brokerage revenues from ECS increased by 19.8 million, or 21.3 , to 112.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by strong organic growth across the energy complex and BGC s leading environmental products. 
 Our FX revenues increased by 12.3 million, or 15.4 , to 92.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by emerging markets products and higher G10 options volumes. 
 Our Credit revenues increased by 4.3 million, or 6.7 , to 68.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, led by Fenics PortfolioMatch and higher emerging market and European credit volumes. 
 Our brokerage revenues from Equities increased by 0.7 million, or 1.3 , to 53.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by U.S. and European equity derivative volumes, partially offset by lower Asian equity derivative activity. 
 Fees from Related Parties 
 Fees from related parties increased by 1.4 million, or 37.1 , to 5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by an increase in revenues in connection with services provided to Cantor. 
 Data, Network and Post-Trade 
 Data, network and post-trade revenues increased by 4.9 million, or 17.5 , to 32.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by strong subscription-based revenue growth across Fenics Market Data and Lucera.

 Interest and Dividend Income 
 Interest and dividend income increased by 6.8 million, or 66.9 , to 16.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was driven by an increase in interest income on borrowings by Cantor under the BGC Credit Agreement, employee loans, and government bonds, which were primarily driven by changing interest rates and larger balances. 
 Other Revenues 
 Other revenues remained flat at 5.8 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Expenses 
 Compensation and Employee Benefits 
 Compensation and employee benefits expense increased by 38.2 million, or 16.4 , to 271.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by higher commissionable revenues. 
 Equity-Based Compensation and Allocations of Net Income to Limited Partnership Units and FPUs 
 Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs increased by 16.4 million, or 23.7 , to 85.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by a 21.1 million compensation charge for the redemption of Newmark Holdings LPUs held by a former BGC executive officer, who is still employed by the Company, during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Occupancy and Equipment 
 Occupancy and equipment expense increased by 5.2 million, or 12.9 , to 45.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in software licenses and costs for consolidating BGC s London office space. 
 Fees to Related Parties 
 Fees to related parties increased by 1.2 million, or 17.1 , to 8.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Fees to related parties are primarily allocations paid to Cantor for administrative and support services.

 Professional and consulting fees increased by 6.5 million, or 47.0 , to 20.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by an increase in consulting and other professional services and fees.

 Commissions and floor brokerage expense increased by 2.8 million, or 18.9 , to 17.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by a higher number of trades in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase in commission expense. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased by 4.3 million, or 20.9 , to 25.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by interest expense related to the BGC Group 6.600 Senior Notes issued June 10, 2024, partially offset by no borrowings on the Revolving Credit Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 240.0 million of borrowings on the Revolving Credit Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Expenses

The increase was primarily driven by a one-time benefit in revaluation of deferred tax balances as a result of the Corporate Conversion in 2023 as well as change in the geographical and business mix of earnings, which can impact our consolidated effective tax rate from period-to-period. 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest in Subsidiaries 
 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries decreased by 2.5 million, or 168.7 , to a loss of 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a gain of 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Our ECS revenues increased by 67.7 million, or 24.0 , to 349.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by strong volume growth across our energy complex and our environmental products. 
 Our FX revenues increased by 27.6 million, or 11.6 , to 265.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by emerging market products and higher G10 options volumes. 
 Our Credit revenues increased by 5.9 million, or 2.7 , to 225.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by higher trading volumes across European and emerging markets credit products, offset by lower Asian credit activity. 
 Our brokerage revenues from Equities decreased by 10.6 million, or 5.9 , to 167.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to lower equity derivative trading volumes, partially offset by higher cash equity activity. 
 Fees from Related Parties 
 Fees from related parties increased by 2.4 million, or 20.7 , to 14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year, which was primarily driven by an increase in revenues in connection with services provided to Cantor, such as accounting, occupancy, and legal.

 Data, network and post-trade revenues increased by 12.5 million, or 15.2 , to 94.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in prior year. This increase was primarily driven by strong revenue growth across Lucera, Fenics Market Data, and our Capitalab post-trade business, as a result of expanding both our client base and our offerings. 
 Interest and Dividend Income 
 Interest and dividend income increased by 15.0 million, or 52.1 , to 43.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by an increase in interest income on money market funds, borrowings by Cantor under the BGC Credit Agreement, and employee loans, which were primarily driven by changing interest rates and larger balances. 
 Other Revenues 
 Other revenues increased by 0.6 million, or 4.0 to 15.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in consulting income.

This was primarily driven by the issuance of common stock and grants of exchangeability, which included a 60.9 million charge for the redemption of certain non-exchangeable limited partnership units in connection with the issuance of shares of BGC Class A common stock and the accompanying tax payments related to the Corporate Conversion, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was partially offset by compensation charges of 27.7 million and 21.1 million, respectively, for the acceleration of restricted stock awards and redemption of Newmark Holdings LPUs held by a former BGC executive officer, who is still employed by the Company, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Commissions and floor brokerage expense increased by 6.2 million, or 13.3 , to 52.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by a higher number of trades in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Interest expense increased by 10.4 million, or 18.4 , to 66.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by interest expense related to the BGC Partners 8.000 Senior Notes issued on May 24, 2023, the BGC Group 6.600 Senior Notes issued June 10, 2024, and higher borrowings on both the Revolving Credit Agreement and BGC Credit Agreement, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense related to the BGC Partners 5.375 Senior Notes due to repayment in full on July 24, 2023.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Balance Sheet 
 Our balance sheet and business model are not capital intensive. Our assets consist largely of Cash and cash equivalents, collateralized and uncollateralized short-dated receivables and less liquid assets needed to support our business. Longer-term capital (equity and notes payable) is held to support the less liquid assets and potential capital investment opportunities. Total assets as of September 30, 2024 were 4.4 billion, an increase of 38.0 as compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was driven primarily by an increase in Receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers, Financial instruments owned, at fair value, Accrued commissions and other receivables, net and Loan receivable from related parties. We maintain a significant portion of our assets in Cash and cash equivalents and Financial instruments owned, at fair value, with Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 of 563.5 million, and our Liquidity as of September 30, 2024 of 772.5 million. See Liquidity Analysis below for a further discussion of our Liquidity and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Our Financial instruments owned, at fair value, were 211.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 45.8 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 As part of our cash management process, we may enter into Reverse Repurchase Agreements and other short-term investments, some of which may be with Cantor. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no Reverse Repurchase Agreements outstanding. Our Repurchase Agreements as of September 30, 2024 were 2.0 million, which matured on October 1, 2024. We had no Repurchase Agreements as of December 31, 2023. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 there were no securities loaned outstanding.

 At December 31, 2019, the Company completed the calculation of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign subsidiaries earnings pursuant to the Tax Act and previously recorded a net cumulative tax expense of 28.6 million, net of foreign tax credits. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company settled its 2017 audit with the Internal Revenue Service which included the transition tax. The revised net cumulative transition tax expense is 25.3 million, net of foreign tax credits, resulting in a net adjustment of the payable balance by 3.3 million. An installment election can be made to pay the taxes over eight years with 40 paid in equal installments over the first five years and the remaining 60 to be paid in installments of 15 , 20 and 25 in years six, seven and eight, respectively. The cumulative remaining balance as of September 30, 2024 was 11.4 million. 
 On June 10, 2024, Cantor borrowed 180.0 million from the Company under the BGC Credit Agreement. On July 31, 2024, Cantor made a partial repayment of 18.0 million to the Company of the 180.0 million borrowed from the Company under the BGC Credit Agreement. On September 25, 2024, Cantor made an additional partial repayment of 12.0 million to the Company of the initial 180.0 million borrowed from the Company under the BGC Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, Cantor had 150.0 million of borrowings outstanding from the Company under the BGC Credit Agreement. The Company recorded interest income related to the BGC Credit Agreement of 3.0 million and 3.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company did not record any interest income related to the BGC Credit Agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on this facility was 6.96 . On October 1, 2024, Cantor repaid in full the remaining 150.0 million of borrowings outstanding to the Company under the BGC Credit Agreement, plus accrued interest. See Note 13 Related Party Transactions, Note 17 Notes Payable and Other Borrowings, and Note 26 Subsequent Events to our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information regarding our BGC Credit Agreement with Cantor. 
 Additionally, in August 2013, the Audit Committee authorized us to invest up to 350.0 million in an asset-backed commercial paper program for which certain Cantor entities serve as placement agent and referral agent. The program issues short-term notes to money market investors and is expected to be used from time to time as a liquidity management vehicle. The notes are backed by assets of highly rated banks. We are entitled to invest in the program so long as the program meets investment policy guidelines, including policies relating to ratings. Cantor will earn a spread between the rate it receives from the short-term note issuer and the rate it pays to us on any investments in this program. This spread will be no greater than the spread earned by Cantor for placement of any other commercial paper note in the program. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any investments in the program. 
 
 Funding 
 Our funding base consists of longer-term capital (equity and notes payable), collateralized financings and shorter-term liabilities incurred through the normal course of business. We have limited need for short-term unsecured funding in our regulated entities for their brokerage business. Contingent liquidity needs are largely limited to potential cash collateral that may be needed to meet clearing bank, clearinghouse, and exchange margins and/or to fund fails. Current cash and cash equivalent balances exceed our potential normal course contingent liquidity needs. We believe that cash and cash equivalents in and available to our largest regulated entities, inclusive of financing provided by clearing banks and cash segregated under regulatory requirements, is adequate for potential cash demands of normal operations, such as margin or financing of fails. We expect our operating activities going forward to generate adequate cash flows to fund normal operations, share repurchases, and any dividends paid pursuant to our dividend policy. However, we continually evaluate opportunities for growth and to further enhance our strategic position, including, among other things, acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures potentially involving all types and combinations of equity, debt and acquisition alternatives. As a result, we may need to raise additional funds to: 
 increase the regulatory net capital necessary to support operations; 
 support continued growth in our businesses; 
 effect acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and other transactions; 
 develop new or enhanced products, services and markets; and 
 respond to competitive pressures. 
 Acquisitions and financial reporting obligations related thereto may impact our ability to access longer term capital markets funding on a timely basis and may necessitate greater short-term borrowings in the interim. This may impact our credit rating or our costs of borrowing. We may need to access short-term capital sources to meet business needs from time to time, including, but not limited to, conducting operations; hiring or retaining brokers, salespeople, managers, technology professionals and other front-office personnel; financing acquisitions; and providing liquidity, including in situations where we may not be able to access the capital markets in a timely manner when desired by us. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional financing when needed on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all.

 DEBT REPURCHASE PROGRAM 
 On June 11, 2020, BGC Partners Board of Directors and its Audit Committee authorized a debt repurchase program for the repurchase by the Company of up to 50.0 million of Company Debt Securities, and on July 1, 2023, BGC Group s Board of Directors and its Audit Committee authorized a debt repurchase program for the repurchase by the Company of up to 50.0 million of Company Debt Securities. Repurchases of Company Debt Securities, if any, are expected to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption. 
 Under the authorization, the Company may make repurchases of Company Debt Securities for cash from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions upon such terms and at such prices as management may determine. Additionally, the Company is authorized to make any such repurchases of Company Debt Securities through CF Co (or its affiliates), in its capacity as agent or principal, or such other broker-dealers as management shall determine to utilize from time to time, and such repurchases shall be subject to brokerage commissions which are no higher than standard market commission rates.

 LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS 
 We consider our Liquidity, a non-GAAP financial measure, to be comprised of the sum of Cash and cash equivalents, Reverse Repurchase Agreements, and Financial instruments owned, at fair value, less securities loaned and Repurchase Agreements. We consider liquidity to be an important metric for determining the amount of cash that is available or that could be readily available to the Company on short notice. The discussion below describes the key components of our Liquidity analysis. We believe our cash, cash flows, and financing arrangements are sufficient to support our cash requirements for the next twelve months and beyond. 
 We consider the following in analyzing changes in our Liquidity: 
 Our Liquidity analysis includes a comparison of our Consolidated net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items (e.g., Equity-based compensation) as presented on the cash flow statement. Dividends are payments made to our holders of common shares and are related to earnings from prior periods. These timing differences will impact our cash flows in a given period; 
 Our investing and funding activities represent a combination of our capital raising activities, including short-term borrowings and repayments, BGC Class A common stock repurchases and, previously, partnership unit redemptions, purchases and sales of securities, dispositions, and other investments (e.g., acquisitions, forgivable loans to new brokers and capital expenditures all net of depreciation and amortization); 
 Our securities settlement activities primarily represent deposits with clearing organizations; 
 Other changes in working capital represent changes primarily in receivables and payables and accrued liabilities that impact our Liquidity; and 
 Changes in Reverse Repurchase Agreements and Financial instruments owned, at fair value may result from additional cash investments or sales, which will be offset by a corresponding change in Cash and cash equivalents and, accordingly, will not result in a change in our Liquidity. Conversely, changes in the market value of such securities are reflected in our earnings or other comprehensive income (loss) and will result in changes in our Liquidity. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries had 563.5 million of Cash and cash equivalents. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries held securities worth 211.0 million within their Liquidity position as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries had 2.0 million of Repurchase Agreements.

 Discussion of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 The table below presents our Liquidity Analysis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents 563,467 655,641 Financial instruments owned, at fair value 211,026 45,792 Repurchase agreements (1,962) Total 772,531 701,433 
 The 71.1 million increase in our Liquidity position from 701.4 million as of December 31, 2023 to 772.5 million as of September 30, 2024 was primarily related to a 165.2 million increase in Financial instruments owned, at fair value due to the Company purchasing treasury bills that mature on December 12, 2024 and had a carrying value of 148.6 million as of September 30, 2024. In September 2024, the Company purchased additional treasury bills that mature on December 31, 2024 and had a carrying value of 14.8 million as of September 30, 2024. Furthermore, Cash and cash equivalents decreased by 92.2 million. The Company received 171.7 million of contributions from the FMX Equity Partners, which the Company used to purchase 146.1 million of treasury bills. The remaining movement in the Cash and cash equivalents balance is primarily due to the issuance of an aggregate of 500.0 million principal amount of the BGC Group 6.600 Senior Notes, which were partially offset by the Company s repayment of 240.0 million of borrowings on the Revolving Credit Agreement and Cantor borrowing 150.0 million from the Company under the BGC Credit Agreement, share repurchases of 212.2 million, ordinary movements in working capital, capitalized expenditures, tax payments, dividends, and our continued investment in Fenics Growth Platforms and cash flows used in operations. 
 Discussion of the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 The table below presents our Liquidity Analysis as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022: 
 September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents 559,587 484,989 Reverse Repurchase Agreements Financial instruments owned, at fair value 45,453 39,319 Total 605,040 524,308 
 The 80.7 million increase in our Liquidity position from 524.3 million as of December 31, 2022 to 605.0 million as of September 30, 2023, was primarily related to the issuance of 350.0 million principal amount of BGC Partners 8.000 Senior Notes, 240.0 million of borrowings from the Revolving Credit Agreement, and cash flow from operations, partially offset by the repayment of the 450.0 million principal amount of, plus accrued interest on, the BGC Partners 5.375 Senior Notes, ordinary movements in working capital, the acquisition of Trident, tax payments, dividends and distributions, share repurchases, and our continued investments in Fenics Growth Platforms. 
 
 CREDIT RATINGS 
 As of September 30, 2024, our public long-term credit ratings and associated outlooks were as follows: 
 Rating Outlook Fitch Ratings Inc. BBB- Stable Standard Poor s BBB- Stable Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. BBB+ Stable Kroll Bond Rating Agency BBB Stable 
 
 107 

Table of Contents 

 Credit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels and the firm s competitive position in the industry. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Any downgrade in our credit ratings and/or the associated outlooks could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on terms acceptable to us, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain any such financing. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions. In connection with certain agreements, we may be required to provide additional collateral in the event of a credit ratings downgrade. 
 
 CLEARING CAPITAL 
 In November 2008, we entered into the Clearing Capital Agreement with Cantor to clear U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities transactions on our behalf. In June 2020, the Clearing Capital Agreement was amended to cover Cantor providing clearing services in all eligible financial products to us and not just U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, so long as Cantor is providing clearing services to us, Cantor shall be entitled to request from us cash or other collateral acceptable to Cantor in the amount reasonably requested by Cantor under the Clearing Capital Agreement or Cantor will post cash or other collateral on our behalf for a commercially reasonable charge. On June 7, 2024, we amended the Clearing Capital Agreement to modify the rate charged by Cantor for posting margin in respect of trades cleared on behalf of the Company to a rate equal to Cantor s cost of funding such margin through a draw on a third party credit facility provided to Cantor for which the use of proceeds is to finance clearinghouse margin deposits and related transactions. The Clearing Capital Agreement amendment also assigned BGC Partners rights and obligations thereunder to BGC Group. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company was charged 1.4 million and 0.7 million, respectively, by Cantor for the cash or other collateral posted by Cantor on BGC s behalf. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company was charged 3.3 million and 1.5 million, respectively, by Cantor for the cash or other collateral posted by Cantor on BGC s behalf. Cantor held cash or other property from the Company as collateral as of September 30, 2024 at a fair value of 148.6 million. 
 
 REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 
 Our Liquidity and available cash resources are restricted by regulatory requirements applicable to our operating subsidiaries. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in civil and criminal judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, enhanced oversight, remediation, or other relief. 
 In addition, self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NFA, along with statutory bodies such as the FCA, the SEC, and the CFTC, require strict compliance with their rules and regulations. The requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with broker-dealers and are not designed to specifically protect stockholders. These regulations often serve to limit our activities, including through net capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements. 
 The final phase of Basel III (unofficially called Basel IV is a global prudential regulatory standard designed to make banks more resilient and increase confidence in the banking system. Its wide scope includes reviewing market, credit and operational risk along with targeted changes to leverage ratios. Basel IV includes updates to the calculation of bank capital requirements with the aim of making outcomes more comparable across banks globally. 
 The FCA is the relevant statutory regulator in the U.K. The FCA s objectives are to protect customers, maintain the stability of the financial services industry and promote competition between financial services providers. It has broad rule-making, investigative and enforcement powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and subsequent derivative legislation and regulations.

 In January 2022, the FCA introduced a new Internal Capital and Risk Assessment (ICARA) process as a replacement for the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). The ICARA process incorporates business model assessment, forecasting and stress testing, recovery planning and wind-down planning. All firms were required to submit their proposed ICARA documentation by March 31, 2023, and then review its adequacy on an annual basis thereafter, after which the FCA provide feedback that may require further documentation and may lead to a change in capital requirements. The adoption of these proposed rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and broker-dealer customers to operate trading businesses and to maintain current capital market exposures under the present structure of their balance sheets, and will cause these entities to need to raise additional capital in order to stay active in our marketplaces. 
 In July 2023, the FCA further ensured that Consumer Duty is at the heart of every financial institution by rolling out Principle 12 specifically related to Consumer Duty, where a firm must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers. This initiative is poised to redefine the relationship between consumers and financial institutions, where the FCA has demanded financial institutions foster a culture of trust, transparency, and accountability. Under Consumer Duty, the onus has shifted to financial institutions to prioritize their customers best interest in every consideration made by the financial institution (the entire customer life cycle) including demonstration and evidence that the product/service/action is in the best interest of the customer. Although not immediately applicable to our business as we do not conduct business directly with the retail sector, we are conscious of the impact that this will have on underlying clients who have obligations to fulfil. In so doing, they may require our firm to provide additional reporting in order to help them evidence their obligations. 
 In addition, the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the countries in which they do business. Certain other of our foreign subsidiaries are required to maintain non-U.S. net capital requirements. For example, in Hong Kong, BGC Securities (Hong Kong), LLC, GFI (HK) Securities LLC and Sunrise Brokers (Hong Kong) Limited are regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission. BGC Capital Markets (Hong Kong), Limited and GFI (HK) Brokers Ltd are regulated by The Hong Kong Monetary Authority. All are subject to Hong Kong net capital requirements. In France, Aurel BGC and BGC France Holdings; in Australia, BGC Partners (Australia) Pty Limited and Fixed Income Solutions Pty Limited; in Japan, BGC Shoken Kaisha Limited s Tokyo branch; in Singapore, BGC Partners (Singapore) Limited, GFI Group Pte Ltd and Ginga Global Markets Pte Ltd; in Korea, BGC Capital Markets Foreign Exchange Broker (Korea) Limited and GFI Korea Money Brokerage Limited; in Philippines, GFI Group (Philippines) Inc. and in Brazil, BGC Liquidez Distribuidora De Titulos E Valores Mobiliarios Ltda., all have net capital requirements imposed upon them by local regulators. 
 These subsidiaries may also be prohibited from repaying the borrowings of their parents or affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to their parent or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions, in each case, which may result in a significant reduction in their regulatory capital position without prior notification or approval from their principal regulator. See Note 21 Regulatory Requirements to our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details on our regulatory requirements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 717.5 million of net assets were held by regulated subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, these subsidiaries had aggregate regulatory net capital, as defined, in excess of the aggregate regulatory requirements, as defined, of 396.3 million. 
 BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, our subsidiaries, operate as SEFs. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons for made available to trade products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been implemented. We also own ELX, which became a dormant contract market on July 1, 2017 and in July 2021, we completed the purchase of the CX Futures Exchange (now FMX Futures Exchange) from Cantor, which represents our futures exchange and related clearinghouse. These rules require authorized execution facilities to maintain robust front-end and back-office IT capabilities and to make large and ongoing technology investments. These execution facilities may be supported by a variety of Voice and auction-based execution methodologies, and our Hybrid and Fully Electronic trading capability have performed strongly in this regulatory environment. 
 Much of our global derivatives volumes continue to be executed by non-U.S. based clients outside the U.S. and subject to local prudential regulations. As such, we will continue to operate a number of European regulated venues in accordance with EU or U.K. legislation and licensed by the FCA or EU-based national supervisors. These venues are also operated for non-derivative instruments for these clients. MiFID II was published by the European Securities and Markets Authority in September 2015, and implemented in January 2018 and introduced important infrastructural changes. 
 MiFID II requires a significant part of the market in these instruments to trade on trading venues subject to transparency regimes, not only in pre- and post-trade prices, but also in fee structures and access. In addition, it has impacted a number of key areas, including corporate governance, transaction reporting, pre- and post-trade transparency, technology synchronization, best execution and investor protection.

Table of Contents 

 MiFID II was intended to help improve the functioning of the EU single market by achieving a greater consistency of regulatory standards. By design, therefore, it was intended that EU member states should have very similar regulatory regimes in relation to the matters addressed to MiFID. MiFID II has also introduced a new regulated execution venue category called an OTF that captures much of the Voice-and Hybrid-oriented trading in the EU. Much of our EU derivatives and fixed income execution business now takes place on OTFs. Further to its decision to leave the EU, the U.K. has implemented MIFID II s requirements into its own domestic legislation. Brexit may impact future market structures and MiFID II rulemaking and implementation due to potential changes in mutual passporting and equivalence arrangements between the U.K. and EU member states (for further information see Overview and Business Environment Financial Services Industry Brexit herein). 
 In addition, the GDPR came into effect in the EU on May 25, 2018 (with the equivalent in the U.K.) and creates new compliance obligations in relation to personal data. The GDPR may affect our practices, and will increase financial penalties for non-compliance significantly. 
 Apart from some minor non-material changes, at this time there has not been any legislation from the EU Commission or the U.K. government that has materially changed how the U.K. and EU approach financial regulation since MiFID II and the implementation of Brexit. Although divergence of U.K. regulation from EU regulation may occur, there has been no firm legislative change signaled or published by the FCA or the U.K. government. While we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations are positive for our business, it is possible that unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may materially adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. 
 See Regulation included in Part I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information related to our regulatory environment.

 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 On August 10, 2023, the shareholder derivative suit concerning our 2017 acquisition of Berkeley Point (as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023) was fully and finally decided in favor of the defendants, with the Delaware Chancery Court issuing a post-trial decision denying the plaintiffs causes of action and finding that the transaction was entirely fair to our shareholders and the Delaware Supreme Court affirming that result. 
 On March 9, 2023, a purported class action complaint was filed against Cantor, BGC Holdings, and Newmark Holdings in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (Civil Action No. 1:23-cv-00265). The collective action, which was filed by seven former limited partners of the defendants on their own behalf and on behalf of other similarly situated limited partners, alleges a claim for breach of contract against all defendants on the basis that the defendants failed to make payments due under the relevant partnership agreements. Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that the non-compete and economic forfeiture provisions upon which the defendants relied to deny payment are unenforceable under Delaware law. The plaintiffs allege a second claim against Cantor and BGC Holdings for antitrust violations under the Sherman Act on the basis that the Cantor and BGC Holdings partnership agreements constitute unreasonable restraints of trade. In that regard, the plaintiffs allege that the non-compete and economic forfeiture provisions of the Cantor and BGC Holdings partnership agreements, as well as restrictive covenants included in partner separation agreements, cause anticompetitive effects in the labor market, insulate Cantor and BGC Holdings from competition, and limit innovation. The plaintiffs seek a determination that the case may be maintained as a class action, an injunction prohibiting the allegedly anticompetitive conduct, and monetary damages of at least 5.0 million. On April 28, 2023, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In response, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On July 14, 2023, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint in March 2024. Defendants motion to dismiss the second amended complaint is fully briefed as of May 2024 and a decision is forthcoming. The Company believes the lawsuit has no merit. However, as with any litigation, the outcome cannot be determined with certainty. 
 Other legal proceedings 
 On February 16, 2024, an alleged Company shareholder, Martin J. Siegel, filed a putative class action lawsuit against Cantor Fitzgerald, LP and Howard W. Lutnick in the Delaware Court of Chancery, asserting that the Corporate Conversion was unfair to Class A shareholders of BGC Partners, Inc. because it increased Cantor s percentage voting control over the Company. The suit is captioned Martin J. Siegel v. Cantor Fitzgerald, LP, C.A. 2024-0146-LWW. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on April 22, 2024. That motion has been fully briefed and will be heard by the Court on January 9, 2025. While the lawsuit is in its early stages and does not name the Company as a party, the Company believes the action lacks merit.

 CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT PRIORITIES, DIVIDEND POLICY AND REPURCHASE PROGRAM 
 BGC s current capital allocation priorities are to use our liquidity to return capital to stockholders and to continue investing in the growth of our business. We have repurchased 29.8 million shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Any dividends, if and when declared by our Board, will be paid on a quarterly basis. The dividend to our common stockholders is expected to be calculated based on a number of factors. No assurance can be made, however, that a dividend will be paid each quarter. The declaration, payment, timing, and amount of any future dividends payable by us will be at the sole discretion of our Board using the fully diluted share count. 
 We are a holding company, with no direct operations, and therefore we are able to pay dividends only from our available cash on hand and funds received from distributions from BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo. Our ability to pay dividends may also be limited by regulatory considerations as well as by covenants contained in financing or other agreements. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends may be payable only out of surplus, which is our net assets minus our capital (as defined under Delaware law), or, if we have no surplus, out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Accordingly, any unanticipated accounting, tax, regulatory or other charges against net income may adversely affect our ability to declare and pay dividends. While we intend to declare and pay dividends quarterly, there can be no assurance that our Board will declare dividends at all or on a regular basis or that the amount of our dividends will not change. 
 
 OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 
 Dual Class Equity Structure of BGC Group, Inc. We have a dual class equity structure, consisting of shares of BGC Class A common stock and BGC Class B common stock. We expect to retain and have no plans to change our dual class structure. 
 BGC Class A common stock. Each share of BGC Class A common stock is generally entitled to one vote on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. As of September 30, 2024, there were 418.9 million shares of BGC Class A common stock issued and 375.4 million shares outstanding. On June 21, 2017, Cantor pledged 10.0 million shares of BGC Class A common stock in connection with a partner loan program. On November 23, 2018, those shares of BGC Class A common stock were converted into 10.0 million shares of BGC Class B common stock and remain pledged in connection with the partner loan program, as amended and restated effective as of October 5, 2023 with such modifications thereto as necessary to reflect the Corporate Conversion. 
 From time to time, we may actively continue to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock including from Cantor, Newmark, our executive officers, other employees, partners and others. 
 BGC Class B common stock. Each share of BGC Class B common stock is generally entitled to the same rights as a share of BGC Class A common stock, except that on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, each share of BGC Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes. The BGC Class B common stock generally votes together with the BGC Class A common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. As of September 30, 2024, Cantor and CFGM held an aggregate of 96.3 million shares of BGC Class B common stock, representing 88.0 of the outstanding shares of BGC Class B common stock and approximately 65.5 of our total voting power. As of September 30, 2024, Mr. Lutnick and individuals related to Mr. Lutnick owned 13.1 million shares of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing 12.0 of the outstanding shares of BGC Class B common stock and approximately 8.9 of our total voting power. Together, Cantor, CFGM, Mr. Lutnick and individuals related to Mr. Lutnick owned 100 of the outstanding shares of BGC Class B common stock and approximately 74.4 of our total voting power. 
 Shares of BGC Class B common stock are convertible into shares of BGC Class A common stock at any time in the discretion of the holder on a one-for-one basis. Accordingly, if Cantor, CFGM, Mr. Lutnick and individuals related to Mr. Lutnick converted all of their BGC Class B common stock into BGC Class A common stock on September 30, 2024, Cantor would have held 19.2 of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, CFGM would have held 0.6 of the voting power, Mr. Lutnick and individuals related to Mr. Lutnick would have held 6.6 of the voting power, and the public stockholders would have held 73.6 of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock (and Cantor and CFGM s indirect economic interests in BGC U.S. and BGC Global would remain unchanged).

 As a result of the Corporate Conversion, 64.0 million Cantor units, including 5.7 million purchased on June 30, 2023, were converted into shares of BGC Group Class B common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the Corporate Conversion Agreement, provided that a portion of the 64.0 million shares of BGC Group Class B common stock issued to Cantor will exchange into BGC Group Class A common stock in the event that BGC Group does not issue at least 75,000,000 in shares of BGC Group Class A or B common stock in connection with certain acquisition transactions prior to July 1, 2030, the seventh anniversary of the Corporate Conversion. 
 On July 2, 2023, Cantor distributed an aggregate of 15.8 million shares of Class B common stock held by it in satisfaction of its remaining deferred share distribution obligations pursuant to the April 2008 distribution rights shares and the February 2012 distribution rights shares. 14.0 million of the July 2023 distribution shares were distributed to satisfy April 2008 distribution rights shares and 1.8 million of the July 2023 distribution shares were distributed to satisfy February 2012 distribution rights shares. 15.4 million of the July 2023 distribution shares will remain Class B common stock in the hands of the recipient, and 0.4 million of such shares were converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock in the hands of the recipient pursuant to the terms of BGC Group s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Upon distribution of the July 2023 distribution shares, Cantor satisfied all obligations to deliver shares of common stock to satisfy the April 2008 distribution rights shares and February 2012 distribution rights shares. 
 Classes of Founding/Working Partner Interests and Limited Partnership Units Prior to the Corporate Conversion 
 Prior to the Corporate Conversion, our executives and front-office employees held partnership stakes in us and our subsidiaries and generally received their equity compensation through LPUs. Upon the closing of the Corporate Conversion, the BGC Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement was terminated, and the former stockholders of BGC Partners and former limited partners of BGC Holdings now participate in the economics of the BGC businesses through BGC Group. Following the Corporate Conversion, the equity portion of our compensation structure is no longer based upon the issuance of partnership units but instead based upon the use of equity awards, such as RSUs, issued under the BGC Group Equity Plan in order to incentivize and retain our employees, executive officers, and directors. 
 Prior to the Corporate Conversion, while BGC Holdings limited partnership interests generally entitled our partners to participate in distributions of income from the operations of our business, upon leaving BGC Holdings (or upon any other redemption or purchase of such limited partnership interests as described below) any such partners were only entitled to receive over time, and provided he or she did not violate certain partner obligations, an amount for his or her BGC Holdings limited partnership interests that reflected such partner s capital account or compensatory grant awards, excluding any goodwill or going concern value of our business, unless Cantor, in the case of the founding partners, and we, as the general partner of BGC Holdings at that time, otherwise determined. Prior to the Corporate Conversion, we also had the right to effect redemptions of BGC Holdings LPUs and FPUs and concurrently grant shares of our Class A common stock, or to grant our partners the right to exchange their BGC Holdings limited partnership interests for shares of our Class A common stock (if, in the case of founding partners, Cantor so determined and, in the case of working partners and limited partnership unit holders, if we, as the BGC Holdings general partner at that time, with Cantor s consent, determined otherwise) and thereby allowed them to realize any higher value associated with our Class A common stock. Similar provisions with respect to Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests are contained in the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement. 
 Limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings (prior to the Corporate Conversion) and Newmark Holdings (received in connection with the Spin-Off) consist of: (i) founding/working partner units held by limited partners who are employees of the relevant company; (ii) limited partnership units, which consist of a variety of units that are generally held by employees such as REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, HDUs, U.K. LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, AREUs, ARPUs and N Units; (iii) Cantor units which are the exchangeable limited partnership interests held by Cantor entities; and (iv) Preferred Units, which are working partner units that may be awarded to holders of, or contemporaneous with, the grant of certain limited partnership units. These Preferred Units carried the same name as the underlying unit, with the insertion of an additional P to designate them as Preferred Units. Such Preferred Units could not be made exchangeable into BGC Class A common stock and accordingly were not included in the fully diluted share count. Each quarter, the net profits of BGC Holdings were allocated to such Preferred Units at a rate of either 0.6875 (which is 2.75 per calendar year) of the allocation amount assigned to them based on their award price, or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation, before calculation and distribution of the quarterly BGC Holdings distribution for the remaining BGC Holdings units. The Preferred Units were not entitled to participate in BGC Holdings distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution.

Table of Contents 

 Non-distributing partnership units, or N Units, carried the same name as the underlying unit with the insertion of an additional N to designate them as the N Unit type and were designated as NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and NPPSUs. The N Units were not entitled to participate in BGC Holdings distributions, were not allocated any items of profit or loss and were not made exchangeable into shares of BGC Class A common stock. Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its designee, certain N Units may have been converted into the underlying unit type (i.e., an NREU could be converted into an REU) and could then participate in BGC Holdings distributions, subject to terms and conditions determined by us as the general partner of BGC Holdings, in our sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to us and comply with his or her partnership obligations. 
 BGC OpCos Partnership Structures 
 We are a holding company with no direct operations, and our business is operated through two operating partnerships, BGC U.S. OpCo, which holds our U.S. businesses, and BGC Global OpCo, which holds our non-U.S. businesses. 
 Prior to the Corporate Conversion, the limited partnership interests of the two operating partnerships were held by us and BGC Holdings, and the limited partnership interests of BGC Holdings were held by LPU holders, Founding Partners, and Cantor. We held the BGC Holdings general partnership interest and the BGC Holdings special voting limited partnership interest, which entitled us to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC Holdings, and served as the general partner of BGC Holdings, which entitled us to control BGC Holdings. BGC Holdings, in turn, held the BGC U.S. OpCo general partnership interest and the BGC U.S. OpCo special voting limited partnership interest, which entitled the holder thereof to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC U.S. OpCo, and the BGC Global OpCo general partnership interest and the BGC Global OpCo special voting limited partnership interest, which entitled the holder thereof to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC Global OpCo, and served as the general partner of BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo, all of which entitled BGC Holdings (and thereby us) to control each of BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo. 
 Since BGC Holdings held BGC U.S. OpCo limited partnership interests and BGC Global OpCo limited partnership interests, LPU holders, Founding Partners, and Cantor indirectly had interests in BGC U.S. OpCo limited partnership interests and BGC Global OpCo limited partnership interests. Further, in connection with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings were distributed to the holders of limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings, whereby each holder of BGC Holdings limited partnership interests who at that time held a BGC Holdings limited partnership interest received a corresponding Newmark Holdings limited partnership interest, equal in number to each holder s BGC Holdings limited partnership interest divided by 2.2 (i.e., 0.4545 of a unit in Newmark Holdings). Accordingly, existing partners at the time of the Separation in BGC Holdings are also partners in Newmark Holdings and received corresponding units issued at the applicable ratio. Thus, such partners have an indirect interest in Newmark OpCo. 
 As a result of a series of transactions prior to and in anticipation of the Corporate Conversion, all BGC Holdings units held by Newmark employees were redeemed or exchanged, in each case, for shares of BGC Class A common stock or cash. Upon the closing of the Corporate Conversion, the BGC Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement was terminated, we became the owner of all of the limited partnership interests of the two BGC operating partnerships, and the former stockholders of BGC Partners and former limited partners of BGC Holdings now participate in the economics of the BGC businesses through BGC Group.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk arises from potential non-performance by counterparties and customers. BGC has established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to credit risk. BGC maintains a thorough credit approval process to limit exposure to counterparty risk and employs stringent monitoring to control the counterparty risk from its matched principal and agency businesses. BGC s account opening and counterparty approval process includes verification of key customer identification, anti-money laundering verification checks and a credit review of financial and operating data. The credit review process includes establishing an internal credit rating and any other information deemed necessary to make an informed credit decision, which may include correspondence, due diligence calls and a visit to the entity s premises, as necessary. 
 Credit approval is granted subject to certain trading limits and may be subject to additional conditions, such as the receipt of collateral or other credit support. Ongoing credit monitoring procedures include reviewing periodic financial statements and publicly available information on the client and collecting data from credit rating agencies, where available, to assess the ongoing financial condition of the client. 
 In addition, BGC incurs limited credit risk related to certain brokerage activities. The counterparty risk relates to the collectability of the outstanding brokerage fee receivables. The review process includes monitoring both the clients and the related brokerage receivables. The review includes an evaluation of the ongoing collection process and an aging analysis of the brokerage receivables. 
 Principal Transaction Risk 
 Through its subsidiaries, BGC executes matched principal transactions in which it acts as a middleman by serving as counterparty to both a buyer and a seller in matching back-to-back trades. These transactions are then settled through a recognized settlement system or third-party clearing organization. Settlement typically occurs within one to three business days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. BGC generally avoids settlement of principal transactions on a free-of-payment basis or by physical delivery of the underlying instrument. However, free-of-payment transactions may occur on a very limited basis. 
 The number of matched principal trades BGC executes has continued to grow as compared to prior years. Receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers and Payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers on the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition primarily represent the simultaneous purchase and sale of the securities associated with those matched principal transactions that have not settled as of their stated settlement dates. BGC s experience has been that substantially all of these transactions ultimately settle at the contracted amounts, however, the ability to settle has the potential to be impacted by unforeseen circumstances. 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses for a specified position. BGC may allow certain of its desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business and hold long and short inventory positions. These transactions are primarily for the purpose of facilitating clients execution needs, adding liquidity to a market or attracting additional order flow. As a result, BGC may have market risk exposure on these transactions. BGC s exposure varies based on the size of its overall positions, the risk characteristics of the instruments held and the amount of time the positions are held before they are disposed of. BGC has limited ability to track its exposure to market risk and unmatched positions on an intra-day basis; however, it attempts to mitigate its market risk on these positions by strict risk limits, extremely limited holding periods and hedging its exposure. These positions are intended to be held short term to facilitate customer transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades, BGC may not be able to unwind the position and it may be forced to hold the position for a longer period than anticipated. All positions held longer than intra-day are marked to market.

 We also had Financial instruments owned, at fair value, of 211.0 million as of September 30, 2024. These include investments in equity securities, which are publicly-traded. Investments in equity securities carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that the equity securities will not lose value and, in general, securities markets can be volatile and unpredictable. As a result of these different market risks, our holdings of equity securities could be materially and adversely affected. We may seek to minimize the effect of price changes on a portion of our investments in equity securities through the use of derivative contracts. However, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be adequate to protect us against price risks associated with our investments in equity securities. See Note 11 Derivatives and Note 12 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities to our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding these investments and related hedging activities. 
 Our risk management procedures and strict limits are designed to monitor and limit the risk of unintended loss and have been effective in the past. However, there is no assurance that these procedures and limits will be effective at limiting unanticipated losses in the future. Adverse movements in the securities positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a substantial loss. In addition, principal gains and losses resulting from these positions could on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on BGC s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations for any particular reporting period. 
 Operational Risk 
 Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies on a daily basis. If any of our data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including cybersecurity incidents or other failures of our or third party information technology systems, a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses. 
 In addition, despite our contingency plans, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business. 
 Further, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures such as software programs, firewalls and similar technology to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our clients information, the nature of the threats continue to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability or disruption of service, computer viruses, acts of vandalism, or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. There have also been an increasing number of malicious cyber incidents in recent years in various industries, including ours. Any such cyber incidents involving our computer systems and networks, or those of third parties important to our businesses, could present risks to our operations. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 BGC is exposed to risks associated with changes in FX rates. Changes in FX rates create volatility in the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Company s revenues and expenses. In addition, changes in the remeasurement of BGC s foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities are recorded as part of its results of operations and fluctuate with changes in foreign currency rates. BGC monitors the net exposure in foreign currencies on a daily basis and hedges its exposure as deemed appropriate with highly rated major financial institutions. 
 The majority of the Company s foreign currency exposure is related to the U.S. dollar versus the pound sterling and the euro. For the financial assets and liabilities denominated in the pound sterling and euro, including foreign currency hedge positions related to these currencies, we evaluated the effects of a 10 shift in exchange rates between those currencies and the U.S. dollar, holding all other assumptions constant. The analysis used the stress-tested scenario as the U.S. dollar strengthening against both the euro and against the pound sterling. If as of September 30, 2024, the U.S. dollar had strengthened against both the euro and the pound sterling by 10 , the currency movements would have had an aggregate negative impact on our net income of approximately 10.4 million.

 Interest Rate Risk 
 BGC had 1,449.5 million in fixed-rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024. These debt obligations are not currently subject to fluctuations in interest rates, although in the event of refinancing or issuance of new debt, such debt could be subject to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, BGC did not have any borrowings outstanding under its Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement interest rate on borrowings is based on SOFR or a defined base rate plus additional margin. As of September 30, 2024, BGC did not have any borrowings outstanding under its BGC Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the BGC Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to 25 basis points less than the applicable borrower s borrowing rate under its revolving credit agreement with third party banks, or if FICC-GSD Margin Loans, at a rate equal to the overnight interest rate actually earned by the borrower or its affiliates on borrowings under the applicable FICC-GSD Margin Loan that are posted to clearinghouses or kept available for posting at clearinghouses. To assess exposure to interest rate risk, we evaluated the effect of a 1 increase in interest rates, holding all other assumptions constant. The analysis indicated that there would be no impact to our consolidated net earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our consolidated net earnings would have declined by 1.2 million if interest rates increased by an additional 1 . 
 BGC had 1,149.5 million in fixed-rate debt outstanding as of October 31, 2024. These debt obligations are not currently subject to fluctuations in interest rates, although in the event of refinancing or issuance of new debt, such debt could be subject to changes in interest rates. As of October 31, 2024, BGC had 200.0 million of borrowings outstanding under its Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement interest rate on borrowings is based on SOFR or a defined base rate plus additional margin. As of October 31, 2024, BGC did not have any borrowings outstanding under its BGC Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the BGC Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to 25 basis points less than the applicable borrower s borrowing rate under its revolving credit agreement with third party banks, or if FICC-GSD Margin Loans, at a rate equal to the overnight interest rate actually earned by the borrower or its affiliates on borrowings under the applicable FICC-GSD Margin Loan that are posted to clearinghouses or kept available for posting at clearinghouses. To assess exposure to interest rate risk, we evaluated the effect of a 1 increase in interest rates, holding all other assumptions constant. The analysis indicated that our consolidated net earnings would have declined by 0.2 million for the month ended October 31, 2024, and 1.3 million for the year to date ending October 31, 2024, respectively, if interest rates increased by an additional 1 . 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is recorded, processed, accumulated, summarized and communicated to its management, including its Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. The Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
