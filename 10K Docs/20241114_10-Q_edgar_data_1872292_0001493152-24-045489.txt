CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING-STATEMENTS 

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q Form 10-Q of Rainmaker Worldwide Inc. (the Company includes statements that
are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use
of such terms as believes, estimates, anticipates, expects, plans, 
 intends, may, could, might, will, should, approximately 
or the negative or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words.
They appear in a number of places throughout this Form 10-Q and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs, projections, outlook,
analyses or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, our available cash,
liquidity, prospects, growth and strategies, the length of time that we will be able to continue to fund our operating expenses and capital
expenditures, our expected financing needs and sources of financing, the industry in which we operate and the trends that may affect
our industry or us. 

By
their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to the occurrence and timing of events or
circumstances, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. As a result of this, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking
statements in this Form 10-Q will prove to be accurate. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking
statement contained in this Form 10-Q, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that
our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ
materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements
contained in this Form 10-Q, they may not be predictive of results or developments in future periods. 

Some
of the material factors that we believe could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated or predicted include: 

the
 successful development and implementation of our sales and marketing campaigns; 

the
 size and growth of the potential markets for our product and our ability to serve those markets; 

regulatory
 developments in the United States and other countries; 

our
 available cash; 

the
 accuracy of our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues, capital requirements and needs for additional financing; 

our
 ability to obtain additional funding; 

our
 ability to manufacture and the performance of third-party manufacturers; 

our
 ability to identify license and collaboration partners and to maintain existing relationships; and 

our
 ability to successfully implement our strategy. 

You
should also read carefully the factors described in the Risk Factors section of the Form 10-12GA. Any forward-looking statements
that we make in this Form 10-Q speak only as of the date of such statement, and we undertake no obligation to update such statements
to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q except as required by the federal securities laws. 

This
Form 10-Q includes statistical and other industry and market data that we obtained from industry publications and research, surveys and
studies conducted by third parties. Industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies generally indicate that their
information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such
information. While we believe these industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies are reliable, we have not independently
verified such data.

RWI

with the Company (the Merger pursuant to a share exchange agreement dated June 28, 2017 (the Share Exchange Agreement among the Company, RWI and RWI s 45 shareholders. Upon completion of the Merger, and in accordance with the terms and provisions
of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired an aggregate of common shares in the capital of RWI from the RWI Shareholders
(being all of the issued and outstanding shares in the capital of RWI) in exchange for an aggregate of restricted shares of
the Company s common stock. Therefore, RWI became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company effective July 3, 2017. The Company s
former name, Gold and Silver Mining of Nevada, Inc. CJT was changed on April 24, 2017, in expectation of and conditional
upon completion of the Merger. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with RWI considered the accounting acquirer since

Going
Concern 

The
Company has incurred continuing losses from its operations and has an accumulated deficit of . There are no assurances the
Company will be able to raise capital on acceptable terms or that cash flows generated from its operations will be sufficient to meet
its current operating costs and required debt service. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, it
may be required to reduce the scope of its business, which could harm its financial condition and operating results. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue ongoing operations. These financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

The
Company s ability to continue its operations and to pay its obligations when they become due is contingent upon the Company obtaining
additional financing. Management s plans include seeking to procure additional funds through debt and equity financing to enable
it to meet its operating needs including current and future sales orders. In addition, revenues are being forecasted at the operational
level. 

Share
Consolidation 

On
September 26, 2024, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to effect a share consolidation (also known as a reverse stock split) of
its issued and outstanding common shares on a one-for-twenty-five basis. The share consolidation became effective on September 26, 2024.
All share and per share amounts have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the share consolidation.

Overview 

Rainmaker
Worldwide Inc. RAKR , the Company , we , us or our is a Nevada corporation
originally formed on February 27, 1998. The corporation became RAKR on July 3, 2017, in a reverse merger. We are currently developing
projects in various locations around the globe using RAKR and partner technologies. We are implementing these projects using technology
of Rainmaker Holland B.V. RHBV ). RAKR retains access to the technology based on a cost-plus formula. 

Rainmaker
Worldwide Inc. (Ontario) RWI ), an Ontario Corporation, was formed in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada on July 21, 2014, under
the Ontario Business Corporations Act to finance and commercialize patented technology and to consolidate the assets, intellectual property,
and executive management expertise of DRM. RAKR retains a 40 interest in RWI following an investment from financial partners to affect
the acquisition of Miranda. 

On
July 3, 2017, RWI shareholders completed a share exchange with the Company (the Merger pursuant to a share exchange agreement
dated June 28, 2017 (the Share Exchange Agreement among the Company, RWI and RWI s 45 shareholders at the time.
Upon completion of the Merger, and in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired
an aggregate of 9,029,562 common shares of stock in the capital of RWI from the RWI Shareholders (being all the issued and outstanding
shares of RWI) in exchange for an aggregate of 2,672,750 restricted shares of the Company s common stock. Therefore, RWI became
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company effective July 3, 2017. The Company s former name, Gold and Silver Mining of Nevada, Inc. CJT was changed on April 24, 2017, in expectation of and conditional upon completion of the Merger. The Merger was accounted
for as a reverse acquisition with RWI considered the accounting acquirer since the former RWI shareholders remained in control of the
combined entity after the consummation of the transaction. As part of the Merger, net liabilities of 235,495 were recognized on the
Company s balance sheet. As a result of the Merger, the Company trades on the OTC:Pink under the symbol RAKR. 

The
Company is headquartered in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. The Company will utilize its two main types of energy-efficient, fresh water-producing/purification
technologies: (1) Air-to-Water AW ), which harvests fresh water from humidity and heat in the atmosphere, and (2) Water-to-Water WW ), which transforms seawater or polluted water into drinking water. The technologies can be wind driven, solar based,
or can use conventional power sources, such as grid or generator. It is deployable anywhere and leaves no carbon trace if renewable resources
are deployed. Through the acquisition of Miranda and RAKR s own technologies we have multiple options to purify wastewater to potable
water standards. 

22 

Miranda
Acquisition 

On
January 22, 2024, RWI, a 40 subsidiary of RAKR, finalized the acquisition of Miranda. The first payment of one million USD together
with 1,600,000 RAKR common shares was paid to the shareholders of Miranda. This provides RWI with controlling interest of Miranda initially
at 60 of Miranda common stock holdings. The remaining two million USD is to be paid no later than 2 years from the closing date of January
22 nd , 2024. Miranda is coming into 2024 after having a solid year of results in 2023 delivering projects in Iraq and Fiji
among others. RWI and RAKR are actively marketing their solutions in Canada, US, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and South America.
The expanded product portfolio will assist in market entry opportunities for Miranda and RAKR products alike, bringing revenue and value
to all of the companies. 

Ongoing
Approach to Sales and Marketing 

The
Company s ongoing focus will be to pair Rainmaker technologies with those of Miranda and our affiliate partners. 

The
Company has generated limited revenue up to the present time, and its operations for the past four years have been typically focused
on business development, market research, technology research and development activities. The Company had total assets of 30,725, as
of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, net assets were 280,306. 

At
present, the Company executes consulting agreements with experienced executive personnel and senior advisors. Future sales will be heavily
driven by independent distributors and project developers. The Company had revenue for the quarters ending September 30, 2023 and September
30, 2024 of 78,912 and 143,725 respectively. The Company had net losses of 246,815 and 193,963 for the quarters ending September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Year-to-date losses for September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 592,987 and 947,955 respectively. The losses
in 2024 were reduced by 37 compared to the same period in 2023. The losses for the current quarter are driven by operating expenses
including the costs associated with maintaining the Company s listing and current filing status with the SEC, consulting expenses,
stock option expenses, as well as interest. The Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operating
activities and has limited resources or revenues to cover its operating costs. The Company s auditor s report for 2023 stated
that there was substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Products
and Services 

Overview 

Across
the world, fresh water is unevenly distributed. Many regions are desperately under-served, including North Africa, the Middle East, India,
Mexico, large portions of South America, and various island geographies. 

Fundamentally,
the solutions are based on deploying technology with the following attributes to ensure low-cost delivery and Company profitability: 

Versatile 

Scalable
 Cost-effective 

Environmentally
 Socially Sustainable 

Applying
 Proprietary Technology through partners and affiliates 

Air-to-Water
(AW) Harvests fresh water from airborne humidity by using advanced heating and cooling technologies. Water-to-Water (WW) technologies
 Transforms contaminated water (saltwater, sewage, polluted) into safe, clean water by using an environmentally sustainable process.
Through the acquisition of Miranda and RAKR s own technologies we have multiple options to purify wastewater to potable water standards. 

23 

The
operating efficiency of these technologies allows us to provide customers with clean water at a price that is highly competitive relative
to traditional alternatives. We substantially out-perform peer competitors because we can deploy remotely where the water is consumed
and using up to 50 less power than those same competitors. The compact and scalable systems for AW and WW enable decentralized deployment,
in which water is distributed directly to the consumption site with no expensive piping or truck transport. AW and WW are both cost-effective
technology solutions and can be powered by solar, wind, or grid electricity, or a combination of power sources. They can produce roughly
5,000 to 150,000 liters of water per unit, per day, depending on the local conditions and the type of unit deployed. 

The
acquisition of Miranda provides the Company with a full suite of water production and purifications systems that are distributed and
available to communities who need them the most. 

Cost
Information 

Currently
in remote locations, the principal source of supply is bottled water. Accordingly, our solutions are optimally profitable when we compete
head-to-head with bottled water that is transported or bulk water that is transported by truck to local communities. In most remote communities
where this water is imported, the minimum cost per liter is US 0.30 reaching as high as US 2.00, according to our market research. The
Company s fully amortized cost of water per liter including bottling, operating and maintenance, distribution and other costs allows
us to compete profitably to generate corporate value beneficial to our shareholders. The market for distilled water supported in part
by WW-based technology, which is essential to more specialized industrial or commercial activities, is expected to increase margins significantly.

Information 

The
global nature of our approach means that regulatory conditions vary by jurisdiction. We believe that the ultimate test of profitability
in this complex, cross-jurisdictional environment will be the quality of the water that is bottled and tested. The Company seeks to adhere
to World Health Organization standards for clean water using the technologies that are authorized in a particular sovereign jurisdiction. 

Business
Model 

The
RAKR business model typically begins with the identification of a trusted local technology partner and distributor. The Rainmaker delivery
systems will be installed by contracted local third-party experts that are typically Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning HVAC experts. We work with the end clients and their general contractors to build the supporting infrastructure required for our systems (i.e.
holding tanks, platforms etc.). 

In
addition, over the course of the past year, we have been developing partnerships with highly experienced developers of complementary
technology. That gives RAKR the ability to have a more comprehensive product set when proposing solutions to communities, developers
and commercial entities. The most significant advance to date is the acquisition of Miranda. On January 22, 2024, RWI finalized the acquisition
of Miranda (RAKR owns 40 of RWI). Miranda has been delivering systems for more than ten years across 40 countries globally. As a result,
their global experience is invaluable to Rainmaker and Rainmaker shareholders. 

Potential
Improvements 

Potential
improvements and related applications that we are pursuing or plan to pursue include seeking more strategic and technology-based partnerships
with complementary technology and business development companies to expand our global reach and service offering.

Market
Opportunity 

In
the past ten years, there has been a growing awareness of the shortage of fresh water and the associated economic and social effects
the problem magnifies in impoverished and underdeveloped communities. Entities ranging from Water.Org to the United Nations (access to
safe drinking water represents #6 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals articulated by the United Nations) are at the forefront of
driving international policy momentum and prospects for multilateral cooperation in the realms of global governance and public-private
co-regulation. Common to these efforts is the search for scalable and practical solutions that possess applications uniquely suited to
the problem of shortage. 

The
metrics that underpin the international need for ingenuity and action are the same as those that animate and sustain the market opportunity
for our Company: 

(1) 
 Less
 than 3 of the world s water is fresh the rest is seawater and undrinkable in its current state. 

(2) 
 Of
 this 3 , over 2.5 is frozen and locked up in Antarctica, the Arctic and glaciers. 

(3) 
 People
 and animals rely on 0.5 of the world s water. (Source: Unwater.org - Facts and Trends: Water) 

Moreover,
at any moment, the atmosphere contains approximately 37.5 million billion gallons of water. This potential is not currently harvested
by the means of private organizations or government institutions and thus presents a significant opportunity for AW technology to satisfy
worldwide demand for water. 

The
World Health Organization estimates that 50 liters of water per day is required per individual to meet basic needs. It is estimated by
the OECD that by 2030 nearly half of humanity will be living in a condition of severe water stress. Currently, according to UNICEF, 2.2
billion people around the globe lack safe drinking water. While high-income countries only treat 70 of wastewater, low-income countries
treat 8 . With the world s population expected to reach 9 billion by 2038, the global need is indisputably high. Much of the population
expansion is or will be in the very areas that are already suffering from the problem of water scarcity. 

The
above analysis points to a global market for water that is extraordinarily immense. Today, the annual global water market for all purposes
and uses is 650 billion and is expected to expand to 1 trillion by 2025. (Source: RobecoSAM Study (2015, June). Water: the market of
the future). Applying RAKR s approach against the purposes and uses defined above, our solutions are tailored to meet roughly 70 
of that global level of demand. 

Suppliers 

As
stated previously, our principal suppliers for the core technologies to be deployed are Miranda and RHBV. Should RHBV not supply the
appropriate scale of technology required by a project, RAKR has identified multiple technologies of different sizes and types. With the
acquisition of Miranda, we now have complementary technology that we expect to deliver in 2024 to diversify the Rainmaker business model. 

Competition 

The
Rainmaker business model that will deliver potable water at the source of demand is uniquely positioned to address alternative competitive
models. We believe that competitive models, while relevant and plausible alternatives, will not ultimately fully support the global level
of demand for water at a reasonable price per liter. By virtue of our current affiliations, we believe we have a cost per liter competitive
advantage. Accordingly, on a global basis, we do not believe competitive conditions will thwart our ability to produce long-term, corporate
value or significantly diminish our financial results in the near term. However, other companies with sufficiently greater resources
may develop competing products and have an advantage over us based on the relative size. 

Government
Subsidies and Incentives 

While
RAKR is not currently pursuing subsidies and incentives, we believe that over time such programs will be applicable to the Company, and
we will pursue them in due course. 

Over
time, RAKR will seek subsidies and incentives through its deployment of technology in underserved countries and particular communities
within countries. One example is First Nations in Canada where there is an ongoing and desperate shortage of safe drinkable and general-purpose
water. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
have indirect access to intellectual property assets as a consequence of our partial ownership of and various partnerships with RHBV
and Miranda. We believe that this allows us to maintain an edge in the competitive process from a technological and economic cost perspective.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Management s
Plans 

While
we are similar to other development stage companies, we have now pursued and executed a strategy whereby we have a full suite of products
that can deliver distributed water solutions globally. To date, our products have yet to generate significant revenue. As a result, we
have historically suffered recurring losses and we do not have the required cash resources to fully execute our business plans. 

Historically,
the Company s major sources of cash have comprised proceeds from various private offerings of its securities (including common
stock) and debt financing. From 2015 through to the fiscal year end date December 31, 2023, the Company raised approximately 8.2 million
in gross proceeds from various private offerings of our common stock and convertible debt. These funds were raised during various stages
of the company and allowed us first to develop a commercially ready product and as soon as logistics and supply chains allow, deliver
these products into identified projects and begin to generate revenue. The Company has sustained losses from operations in each fiscal
year since our inception, and we expect losses to continue for the indefinite future. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately 74.7 million and 74.1 million and stockholders equity of approximately
 (11.5) and (10.9) million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 288 in cash. 

The
Company recognizes and is addressing the need to raise additional capital in order to continue to execute its business plan in the future.
There is no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that the Company will be able to obtain financing on
terms acceptable to it or whether the Company will become profitable and generate positive operating cash flow. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. Management
considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: 

it
 requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 

changes
 in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have material impact in our results of operations or financial
 condition. 

While
we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. The most significant estimates impact the following
transactions or account balances: stock compensation. 

See
Note 2 in our financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective or Adopted 

Until
December 31, 2021, the Company evaluated embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging to
determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative
at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature did not require derivative treatment under ASC
815, the instrument was evaluated under ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options for consideration of any beneficial conversion
features. On January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective method and reviewed and calculated the
impact on the outstanding financial instruments as of this adoption date concluding there was no impact.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based
on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) required
by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15, as of December 31, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer
has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer also concluded that,
as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We
are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Exchange Act Rule
13a-15. With the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Based on
this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024,
based on those criteria. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses: 

1. 
 As
 of September 30, 2024, due to the inherent issue of segregation of duties in a small company, we have relied heavily on entity or
 management review controls. Accordingly, management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. 

2. 
 As
 of September 30, 2024, we did not establish a formal written policy for the approval, identification, and authorization of related
 party transactions. 

3. 
 During
 the 2023 audit, it was necessary to record adjusting journal entries. Management has determined that the effects of the corrected
 misstatements are material, both individually and in aggregate, to the financial statements as a whole. The corrected misstatements
 or the matters underlying them could potentially cause future period financial statements to be materially misstated, even though,
 in the judgment of our auditor previously, such corrected misstatements are material to the financial statements under audit. 

Professional
 standards define an audit adjustment as a proposed correction of the financial statements that, in the judgment of our auditor previously,
 may not have been detected except through the auditing procedures. An audit adjustment may or may not indicate matters that could
 have a significant effect on the Company s financial reporting process (that is, cause future financial statements to be materially
 misstated). In the judgment of our auditor previously, the adjustments proposed indicate matters that could have a significant effect
 on the Company s financial reporting process. 

Because
of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
as of September 30, 2024, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection
with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including our CEO and EVP Finance, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over
financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.
